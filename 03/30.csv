concentration up to y=0.63 are reported. All the features that characterize the
spin-glass (SG) behavior are found: bifurcation of the dc susceptibility chi vs
temperature curve, a peak in the zero-field cooling branch of this curve
accompanied by a step in the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility chi_ac,
frequency dependence of the peak position in the real part of chi_ac and
scaling behavior. The decay of remnant magnetization is described by a
stretched-exponential function. The characteristic time from the critical
slowing-down formula that governs the dynamics of the system suggests the
existence of the spin clusters. The strongest interactions between the
fluctuating entities are at y equal to the charge carriers concentration in the
system. The SG transition temperature decreases linearly with decreasing y for
y<0.30 and extrapolates to 0 K at y=0 what means that Ni display a magnetic
character in the surrounding Cu-O network starting from the smallest
concentration y. The static critical exponents characterizing the scaling
behavior of the nonlinear part of chi lie between those typical for three
dimensional Ising-like and Heisenberg-like systems

electron-hole asymmetry in part improves the theoretical fit to the existing

To further understand the processes involved in the formation of
massive stars, we have undertaken a study of the gas dynamics surrounding three
massive star forming regions. By observing the large scale structures at high
resolution, we are able to determine properties such as driving source, and
spatially resolve the bulk dynamical properties of the gas such as infall and
outflow. Aims. With high resolution observations, we are able to determine
which of the cores in a cluster forming massive stars is responsible for the
large scale structures. Methods. We present CO observations of three massive
star forming regions with known HII regions and show how the CO traces both
infall and outflow. By combining data taken in two SMA configurations with JCMT
observations, we are able to see large scale structures at high resolution.
Results. We find large (0.26-0.40 pc), massive (2-3 M_sun) and energetic (13-17
\times 10^44 erg) outflows emanating from the edges of two HII regions
suggesting they are being powered by the protostar(s) within. We find infall
signatures in two of our sources with mass infall rates of order 10-4 M_sun/yr.
Conclusions. We suggest that star formation is ongoing in these sources despite
the presence of HII regions. We further conclude that the source(s) within a
single HII region are responsible for the observed large scale structures; that
these large structures are not the net effect of multiple outflows from
multiple HII regions and hot cores.

featuring the spectral breaks predicted by classical physical models for the
synchrotron emission produced in jets of blazars (Blandford & Konigl 1979;
Konigl 1981). A model dealing with blazars as a single population is, at best,
only marginally consistent with data coming from current surveys at high radio
frequencies. Our most successful model assumes different distributions of break
frequencies, nu_M, for BL Lacs and Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). The
former objects have substantially higher values of nu_M, implying that the
synchrotron emission comes from more compact regions; therefore, a substantial
increase of the BL Lac fraction at high radio frequencies and at bright flux
densities is predicted. Remarkably, our best model is able to give a very good
fit to all the observed data on number counts and on distributions of spectral
indices of extragalactic radio sources at frequencies above 5 and up to 220

highest HFI frequencies, and from Herschel surveys are also presented.

as a tool for characterizing the dynamical aspects of light diffusion. We
demonstrate here that the frequency correlation shows a pronounced angle
dependence both in transmission and in reflection geometries. Using a broadband
white light supercontinuum, this angle dependence is characterized and
explained theoretically by a combination of propagation effects outside the
medium and coherent backscattering. We report a strong dependence of the
coherent backscattering contribution on the scattering strength which cannot be
explained by the diffusion theory. Our results indicate that coherent
backscattering of the frequency correlation forms a sensitive probe for the
breakdown of the diffusive regime near localization.

the Malliavin Calculus approach over different techniques that have been
previously proposed. Indeed, these techniques may be computationally expensive
and do not provide flexibility for variance reduction. In contrast, the
Malliavin approach exhibits a higher flexibility by providing a class of
functions that return the same expected value (the Greek) with different

use of the generalized integral by part formula of Malliavin Calculus. In the

the localization technique, introduced in Fourni\'e et al and reduce both the
computational cost and the variance. Moreover, we show that the parameters
employed for variance reduction can be obtained \textit{on the flight} in the

dimensions. On the four dimensional side, our main example is N=2 SQCD with
gauge group SU(L) and 2L fundamental flavours. Using ideas of Nekrasov and
Shatashvili, we argue that the Coulomb branch of this theory provides a
quantization of the classical Heisenberg SL(2) spin chain. Agreement with the
standard quantization via the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz implies the existence of
an isomorphism between the chiral ring of the 4d theory and that of a certain
two-dimensional theory. The latter can be understood as the worldvolume theory
on a surface operator/vortex string probing the Higgs branch of the same 4d
theory. We check the proposed duality by explicit calculation at low orders in
the instanton expansion. One striking consequence is that the Seiberg-Witten
solution of the 4d theory is captured by a one-loop computation in two
dimensions. The duality also has interesting connections with the AGT
conjecture, matrix models and topological string theory where it corresponds to
a refined version of the geometric transition.

self-gravitating systems has not yet been solved successfully. We formulate a
systematic theoretical framework of entropy-based statistical mechanics for
spherically symmetric collisionless self-gravitating systems. We use an
approach that is very different from that of the conventional statistical
mechanics of short-range interaction systems. We demonstrate that the
equilibrium states of self-gravitating systems consist of both mechanical and
statistical equilibria, with the former characterized by a series of
velocity-moment equations and the latter by statistical equilibrium equations,
which should be derived from the entropy principle. The velocity-moment
equations of all orders are derived from the steady-state collisionless
Boltzmann equation. We point out that the ergodicity is invalid for the whole
self-gravitating systems, but it can be re-established locally. Based on the
local ergodicity, using Fermi-Dirac-like statistics, with the nondegenerate
condition and the spatial independence of the local microstates, we rederive
the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. This is consistent with the validity of the
collisionless Boltzmann equation, and should be the correct entropy form for
collisionless self-gravitating systems. Apart from the usual constraints of
mass and energy conservation, we demonstrate that the series of moment or
virialization equations must be included as additional constraints on the
entropy functional when performing the variational calculus; this is an
extension to the original prescription by White & Narayan. Any possible
velocity distribution can be produced by the statistical-mechanical approach
that we have developed with the extended Boltzmann-Gibbs/White-Narayan
statistics. Finally, we discuss the questions of negative specific heat and
ensemble inequivalence for self-gravitating systems.

in a thermal bath and using the one loop quantum corrections potential, we
rewrite Klein-Gordon's (KG) equation in its hydrodynamical representation and
study the phase transition of this scalar field due to a Z_2 symmetry breaking
of its potential. A very general version of a nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation
is obtained. When introducing Madelung's representation, the continuity and
momentum equations for a non-ideal SFDM fluid are formulated, and the
cosmological scenario with the SFDM described in analogy to an imperfect fluid
is then considered where dissipative contributions are obtained in a natural
way.Additional terms appear compared to those obtained in the classical version
commonly used to describe the \LambdaCDM model, i.e., the ideal fluid. The
equations and parameters that characterize the physical properties of the
system such as its energy, momentum and viscous flow are related to the
temperature of the system, scale factor, Hubble's expansion parameter and the
matter energy density. Finally, some details on how galaxy halos and smaller
structures might be able to form by condensation of this SF are given.

in the u, g, r, i, and z bands for a sample of 4458 PGC galaxies, whereas
photometric and spectroscopic data are obtained from the SDSS DR5 catalogue.
Point-Spread Function models are derived in all five bands. Composite colour
images of all objects are visually examined by a group of astronomers, and
galaxies are staged along the Hubble sequence and classified according to 16
morphological attributes describing their structure, texture, as well as
environment and appearance on a five-level scale. The EFIGI Hubble sequence
shows remarkable agreement with the RC3 Revised Hubble Sequence. The main
characteristics and reliability of the catalogue are examined, including
photometric completeness, type mix, systematic trends and correlations. The
final EFIGI database is a large sub-sample of the local Universe, with a dense
sampling of Sd, Sdm, Sm and Im types compared to magnitude-limited catalogues.
We estimate the photometric catalogue to be more than ~ 80% complete for
galaxies with 10<g<14. More than 99.5% of EFIGI galaxies have a known redshift
in the HyperLeda and NED databases.

derive a quantitative description of the Hubble Sequence in terms of the

EFIGI morphological attributes with type confirm that the visual Hubble
sequence is a decreasing sequence of bulge-to-total ratio and an increasing
sequence of disk contribution to the total flux. There is nevertheless a large
dispersion of approximately 5 types for a given bulge-to-total ratio, due to
the fact that the Hubble sequence is primarily based on the strength and pitch
angle of the spiral arms, independently from the bulge-to-total ratio. The
grand spiral design is also related to a steep decrease in visible dust from
types Sb to Sbc-Sc. In contrast, the scattered and giant HII regions show
different strength variation patterns; hence, they do not appear to directly
participate in the establishment of the Hubble sequence. The distortions from a
symmetric profile also incidentally increase along the sequence. Bars and inner
rings are frequent and occur in 41% and 25% of disk galaxies resp. Outer rings
are twice less frequent than inner rings, and outer pseudo-rings occur in 11%
of barred galaxies. Finally, we find a smooth decrease in mean surface
brightness and intrinsic size along the Hubble sequence. The largest galaxies
are cD, Ellipticals and Sab-Sbc spirals, whereas Sd and later spirals are
nearly twice smaller. S0 are intermediate in size, and Im, cE and dE are

shown that the stationary configurations depend on two parameters - the $\alpha

is the disc opening angle (h is the disc halfthickness) and $a$ is the black
hole rotational parameter. When $a > 0$ and $\tilde \delta \ll 1$ the shapes
depend drastically on value of $\alpha$. When $\alpha $ is small the disc
inclination angle oscillates with radius with amplitude and radial frequency of
the oscillations dramatically increasing towards the last stable orbit. For
moderate values of $\alpha $ the oscillations do not take place but the disc
does not align with the equatorial plane at small radii. Its inclination angle
is either increasing towards $R_{ms}$ or exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on
the radial coordinate. Finally, when $\alpha $ is sufficiently large the disc
aligns with the equatorial plane at small radii. When $a < 0$ the disc aligns
with the equatorial plane for all values of $\alpha $. The results reported

span a broad range of eccentricities (0.03<e<0.83), with a median eccentricity
of 0.34. We examine potential observational biases in this sample, and for
visual binaries we show through Monte Carlo simulations that appropriate
selection criteria result in all eccentricities being equally represented (<5%
difference between input and output e distributions). The orbits of this sample
of very low-mass binaries show some significant differences from their
solar-type counterparts. They lack a correlation between orbital period and
eccentricity and display a much higher fraction of near-circular orbits (e<0.1)
than solar-type stars, which together suggest a different formation mechanism
or dynamical history for these two populations. Very low-mass binaries also do
not follow the e^2 distribution of Ambartsumian (1937), which would be expected
if their orbits were distributed in phase space according to a function of
energy alone (e.g., the Boltzmann distribution). We find that numerical
simulations of very low-mass star formation do not completely reproduce the
observed properties of our binary sample. The cluster formation model of Bate
(2009) agrees very well with the overall e distribution, but lack any high-e
(>0.6) binaries at orbital periods comparable to our sample. In contrast, the

result of the repulsion being dominant over the orbital interactions and the
observed layer misorientation of 2$^{\circ}-5^{\circ}$ is an attempt by the

a strong decrease in the HeII-ionizing background to explain the strong

incomplete at z>2.7. Likewise, recent three-dimensional numerical simulations
of HeII reionization qualitatively agree with the observed trend only if HeII

the recently discovered dwarf nova SDSS J162520.29+120308.7 (SDSS J1625). The
data were obtained during the July 2010 eruption of the star and in August and
September 2010 when the object was in quiescence. During the July 2010
superoutburst SDSS J1625 clearly displayed superhumps with a mean period of
$P_{\rm sh}=0.095942(17)$ days ($138.16 \pm 0.02$ min) and a maximum amplitude
reaching almost 0.4 mag. The superhump period was not stable, decreasing very
rapidly at a rate of $\dot P = -1.63(14)\cdot 10^{-3}$ at the beginning of the
superoutburst and increasing at a rate of $\dot P = 2.81(20)\cdot 10^{-4}$ in
the middle phase. At the end of the superoutburst it stabilized around the
value of $P_{\rm sh}=0.09531(5)$ day. During the first twelve hours of the
superoutburst a low-amplitude double wave modulation was observed whose
properties are almost identical to early superhumps observed in WZ Sge stars.
The period of early superhumps, the period of modulations observed temporarily
in quiescence and the period derived from radial velocity variations are the
same within measurement errors, allowing us to estimate the most probable
orbital period of the binary to be $P_{\rm orb}=0.09111(15)$ days ($131.20 \pm
0.22$ min). This value clearly indicates that SDSS J1625 is another dwarf nova
in the period gap. Knowledge of the orbital and superhump periods allows us to
estimate the mass ratio of the system to be $q\approx 0.25$. This high value
poses serious problems both for the thermal and tidal instability (TTI) model
describing the behaviour of dwarf novae and for some models explaining the
origin of early superhumps.

causes the relative permittivity maxima to decrease and the temperature (Tmax)

with increasing PIN. The ceramics in the composition range x = 0.1 to 0.8
behave as ferroelectric relaxors and exhibit very slim hysteresis loops for all

the size of the 1:1 structural ordered domains is influenced by the PIN

radius of each neutron star as inferred from the X-ray flux and spectral
temperature measured during the cooling tails of bursts, when the thermonuclear
flash is believed to have engulfed the entire star. In this paper, we analyze
13,095 X-ray spectra of 446 X-ray bursts observed from 12 sources in order to
assess possible systematic effects in the measurements of the apparent radii of
neutron stars. We first show that the vast majority of the observed X-ray
spectra are consistent with blackbody functions to within a few percent. We
find that most X-ray bursts follow a very well determined correlation between
X-ray flux and temperature, which is consistent with the whole neutron-star
surface emitting uniformly during the cooling tails. We develop a Bayesian
Gaussian mixture algorithm to measure the apparent radii of the neutron stars
in these sources, while detecting and excluding a small number of X-ray bursts
that show irregular cooling behavior. This algorithm also provides us with a
quantitative measure of the systematic uncertainties in the measurements. We
find that those errors in the spectroscopic determination of neutron-star radii
that are introduced by systematic effects in the cooling tails of X-ray bursts
are in the range $\simeq 3-8$%. Such small errors are adequate to distinguish
between different equations of state provided that uncertainties in the
distance to each source and the absolute calibration of X-ray detectors do not
dominate the error budget.

Wolf-Rayet spectral features, and by the observed optical and IR lines ratios

clusters shows large variations, with a decrease at older ages. It is likely
that our analysis is limited to the optically brightest objects (i.e. systems
only partially embedded in their natal cocoons). We map the extinction across
the galaxy using low-resolution spectra and the H_alpha/H_beta ratio, as
obtained from ground-based narrow band imaging. We find that the mean optical
extinction derived in the starburst regions is close to the averaged value
observed in the clusters, but locally, do not trace the more extinguished
clusters. Previous HST studies of BCGs have revealed a population of young and
extremely red super star clusters. We detect a considerable fraction of
clusters affected by a red excess also in Mrk 930. The nature of the red
excess, which turns up at near-IR wavelengths remains unknown. We compare the
cluster and the star formation history, the latter derived from the fit of
spectral population synthesis models to the spectra. We find a general

simply providing relative attenuation images as in conventional tomography. The
purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel polychromatic dual energy
processing algorithm with an emphasis on detection and characterization of
piecewise constant objects embedded in an unknown, cluttered background.
Physical properties of the objects, specifically the Compton scattering and
photoelectric absorption coefficients, are assumed to be known with some level
of uncertainty. Our approach is based on a level-set representation of the
characteristic function of the object and encompasses a number of
regularization techniques for addressing both the prior information we have
concerning the physical properties of the object as well as fundamental,
physics-based limitations associated with our ability to jointly recover the
Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption properties of the scene. In the
absence of an object with appropriate physical properties, our approach returns
a null characteristic function and thus can be viewed as simultaneously solving
the detection and characterization problems. Unlike the vast majority of
methods which define the level set function non-parametrically, i.e., as a
dense set of pixel values), we define our level set parametrically via radial
basis functions (RBF's) and employ a Gauss-Newton type algorithm for cost
minimization. Numerical results show that the algorithm successfully detects
objects of interest, finds their shape and location, and gives a adequate
reconstruction of the background.

variability with the rotation period of about 1.45 days. According to previous
studies, this variability can be explained by the presence of a dark spot
having a magnetic nature, analogous to a sunspot. Motivated by this idea, we
examine possible physical relationships between the suggested dark spot and the
strong-field magnetic structure (magnetic ""spot"", or ""tube"") recently
identified on the surface of this star. Comparing the rotationally-modulated
flux with the variable spectral observables related to the magnetic ""spot"" we
establish their correlation, and therefore their physical relationship.
Modeling the variable photometric flux assuming that it is associated with
temperature variations in the stellar photosphere, we argue that the
strong-field area and dark, low-temperature spot are comparable in size and
located at the same latitudes, essentially overlapping each other with a
possible slight longitudinal shift. In this paper we also present a new,
improved value of the star's rotational period and constrain the

backgrounds. We present a new technique for using gamma-ray data to constrain
the properties of dark matter that makes minimal assumptions about the dark

connecting us to the Galactic Center, and 2) variations from the mean signal
are uncorrelated from one pixel to the next. We apply this technique to recent

and cross section for a variety of annihilation channels. We quantify the
uncertainty introduced into our constraints by uncertainties in the halo
profile and by the possibility that the halo is triaxial. The resultant
constraint, the flux F \leq 4.5\times10^-6 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 for energies
between 1 and 100 GeV at an angle 15 degrees away from the Galactic Center,

history. More recently Bayesian MCMC has become the dominant method of
divergence time estimation and fossil evidence has been re-interpreted as the
specification of prior distributions on the divergence times of calibration
nodes. These so-called ""soft calibrations"" have become widely used but the
statistical properties of calibrated tree priors in a Bayesian setting has not
been carefully investigated. Here we clarify that calibration densities, such
as those defined in BEAST 1.5, do not represent the marginal prior distribution
of the calibration node. We illustrate this with a number of analytical results
on small trees. We also describe an alternative construction for a calibrated
Yule prior on trees that allows direct specification of the marginal prior
distribution of the calibrated divergence time, with or without the restriction
of monophyly. This method requires the computation of the Yule prior
conditional on the height of the divergence being calibrated. Unfortunately, a
practical solution for multiple calibrations remains elusive. Our results
suggest that direct estimation of the prior induced by specifying multiple

supported by the accelerating potential trap. (ii) A pulling scenario: an

localized to the right of the repulsive delta-function, is shoved to the right

the cases of small and large accelerations in the pulling regime, and also for
a small acceleration in the stationary situation, and in the regime of pushing.

device simulation can be performed with the inclusion of electron-phonon
scattering. However, the simulation of realistically sized devices under the
NEGF formalism typically requires prohibitive amounts of memory and computation
time. Two of the most demanding computational problems for NEGF simulation
involve mathematical operations with structured matrices called semiseparable
matrices. In this work, we present parallel approaches for these computational
problems which allow for efficient distribution of both memory and computation
based upon the underlying device structure. This is critical when simulating
realistically sized devices due to the aforementioned computational burdens.
First, we consider determining a distributed compact representation for the
retarded Green's function matrix $G^{R}$. This compact representation is exact
and allows for any entry in the matrix to be generated through the inherent
semiseparable structure. The second parallel operation allows for the
computation of electron density and current characteristics for the device.
Specifically, matrix products between the distributed representation for the
semiseparable matrix $G^{R}$ and the self-energy scattering terms in
$\Sigma^{<}$ produce the less-than Green's function $G^{<}$. As an illustration
of the computational efficiency of our approach, we stably generate the
mobility for nanowires with cross-sectional sizes of up to 4.5nm, assuming an

The novelty of this work lies in deploying the concept of keyed discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) followed by DE operations for encryption purpose. To
this end, a secret key is shared between both encryption and decryption sides.
Firstly two dimensional (2-D) keyed discrete Fourier transform is carried out
on the original image to be encrypted. Secondly crossover is performed between
two components of the encrypted image, which are selected based on Linear
Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) index generator. Similarly, keyed mutation is
performed on the real parts of a certain components selected based on LFSR
index generator. The LFSR index generator initializes it seed with the shared
secret key to ensure the security of the resulting indices. The process
shuffles the positions of image pixels. A new image encryption scheme based on
the DE approach is developed which is composed with a simple diffusion
mechanism. The deciphering process is an invertible process using the same key.
The resulting encrypted image is found to be fully distorted, resulting in
increasing the robustness of the proposed work. The simulation results validate
the proposed image encryption scheme.

violation in D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-, K^+K^- transitions, although the effects are
tiny: Indirect CP asymmetry cannot exceed O(10^{-4}), probably even O(10^{-5});
direct effects are estimated at not larger than 10^{-4}. At B factories direct
and indirect asymmetries have been studied with <t>/\tau_{D^0} ~ 1; no CP
asymmetry was found with an upper bound of about 1%. CDF has shown intriguing
data on CP violation in D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^- [K^+K^-] with <t>/\tau_{D^0} ~ 2.4
[2.65]. Also, CDF has not seen any CP violation. For direct CP asymmetry, CDF
has a sensitivity similar to the combination of the B factories, yet for
indirect CP violation it yields a significantly smaller sensitivity of
a_{cp}^{ind}=(-0.01 +- 0.06_{stat} +- 0.05_{syst})% due to it being based on
longer decay times. New Physics models (NP) like Little Higgs Models with
T-Parity (LHT) can produce an indirect CP asymmetry up to 1%; CDF's findings
thus cover the upper range of realistic NP predictions ~ 0.1 - 1%. One hopes
that LHCb and a Super-Flavour Factory will probe the lower range down to
~0.01%. Such non-ad-hoc NP like LHT cannot enhance direct CP violation

Universe on different scales. We show dependence between the angular momentum
of the structures and their size. The presented observational situation is that
the galaxies, their pairs and compact groups have a non-vanishing angular
momentum. In the structures of mass corresponding to groups of galaxies, this
feature has not been found, while in the clusters and superclusters alignment
of galaxy orientation has been actually found. Also we know that galaxies have
net angular momentum due to the fact that we actually measure the rotation
curves of galaxies. These facts lead to the conclusion that theories which
connect galaxy angular momentum with its surrounding structure are at some
extend favored by data. We show that in the light of scenarios of galaxy
formations this result could be interpreted as an effect of tidal forces
mechanism, but it is also consistent with Li's model, in which galaxies form in
the rotating universe. The theoretical and observational aspects of possible
global rotation of the Universe were discussed as well.

angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) Fermi surface (FS) and
experimental values of superconducting (SC) gaps. The resonance spectra split
in both energy and momenta due to the effects of multiband and multiple gaps in
$s^{\pm}-$pairing; the higher energy peak appears around the commensurate
momenta due to scattering between $\alpha-$FS to $\gamma/\delta-$FS pockets.
The second resonance is incommensurate coming from $\beta-$FS to
$\gamma/\delta-$FS scatterings and its $q-$vector is doping-dependent and hence
on the FS topology. Energies of both resonances $\omega^{1,2}_{res}$ are
strongly doping dependent and are proportional to the gap amplitudes at the
contributing FSs. We also discuss the evolution of the spin excitation spectra
with various other possible gap symmetries, which may be relevant when either
both the electron pockets or both the hole pockets completely disappear.

that sqrt{n}/2-O(1) registers are required for any obstruction-free

processors can repeatedly get timestamps). We improve this existing lower bound
in two ways. First we establish a lower bound of n/6 - O(1) registers for the
obstruction-free long-lived timestamp problem. Previous such linear lower
bounds were only known for constrained versions of the timestamp problem. This
bound is asymptotically tight; Ellen, Fatourou and Ruppert (2008) constructed a
wait-free algorithm that uses n-1 registers. Second we show that sqrt{n} - O(1)

timestamp systems(meaning each processor can get a timestamp at most once). We
show that this bound is also asymptotically tight by providing a wait-free
one-shot timestamp system that uses fewer than 2 sqrt{n} registers, thus
establishing a space complexity gap between one-shot and long-lived timestamp

decorated with a heterogeneous assembly of membrane proteins. These proteins
are so tightly packed that their excluded area interactions can alter the free
energy landscape controlling the conformational transitions suffered by such
proteins. For membrane channels, this effect can alter the critical membrane
tension at which they undergo a transition from a closed to an open state, and
therefore influence protein function \emph{in vivo}. Despite their obvious
importance, crowding phenomena in membranes are much less well studied than in
the cytoplasm.
  Using statistical mechanics results for hard disk liquids, we show that
crowding induces an entropic tension in the membrane, which influences
transitions that alter the projected area and circumference of a membrane
protein. As a specific case study in this effect, we consider the impact of
crowding on the gating properties of bacterial mechanosensitive membrane
channels, which are thought to confer osmoprotection when these cells are
subjected to osmotic shock. We find that crowding can alter the gating energies
by more than $2\;k_BT$ in physiological conditions, a substantial fraction of
the total gating energies in some cases.
  Given the ubiquity of membrane crowding, the nonspecific nature of excluded
volume interactions, and the fact that the function of many membrane proteins
involve significant conformational changes, this specific case study highlights
a general aspect in the function of membrane proteins.

  helium-burning red giant stars","to appear as a Letter to Nature",,"10.1038/nature09935",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in
their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Once a red giant
is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion.
Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in
the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of
internal mixing from rotation and other processes. Progress is hampered by our
inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and
those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way
forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars
using their natural oscillation frequencies. Here we report observations of
gravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction between
evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained with
the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several
hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with
approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups,
allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars
(period spacing mostly about 50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium
(period spacing about 100 to 300 seconds).

that is useful in a wide variety of image processing contexts. It is directly
useful for noise reduction, and frequently used as an intermediate step in
higher level algorithms. For example, it can be particularly useful in edge
detection and segmentation. Three well known algorithms for discontinuity
preserving smoothing are nonlinear anisotropic diffusion, bilateral filtering,
and mean shift filtering. Although slight differences make them each better
suited to different tasks, all are designed to preserve discontinuities while
smoothing. However, none of them satisfy this goal perfectly: they each have
exception cases in which smoothing may occur across hard edges. The principal
contribution of this paper is the identification of a property we call edge
awareness that should be satisfied by any discontinuity preserving smoothing
algorithm. This constraint can be incorporated into existing algorithms to
improve quality, and usually has negligible changes in runtime performance
and/or complexity. We present modifications necessary to augment diffusion and
mean shift, as well as a new formulation of the bilateral filter that unifies
the spatial and range spaces to achieve edge awareness.

summed the linear polarization ($LP$) maps taken with time cadence of 60

horizontal magnetic fields (THMFs) with life time of 1-10 min, and are not
contributed by long-duration weak horizontal magnetic fields. The cellular
structure coincides in position with the negative divergence of the horizontal
flow field, i.e., mesogranular boundaries with downflows. Azimuth distribution
appears to be random for the scale size of the mesogranules. Some pixels have
two separate appearances of THMFs, and the measured time intervals are
consistent with the random appearance. THMFs tend to appear at the mesogranular
boundaries, but appear randomly in time. We discuss the origin of THMFs based
on these observations.

within the Hill sphere of the Jovian planets could explain the presence and

simulations for integrated time intervals $\sim 2$ Myr and found that given the
currently accepted value for the minimum mass solar nebula and planetesimal
number density based upon the \citet{Bottke2010b} size distribution $dN \sim
D^{-1.8} dD$, the collision rates for the different Jovian planets range
between $\sim 60$ and $\gtrsim 10^3 \, \Myr^{-1}$ Additionally we found that
the probability that these collisions remove enough orbital energy to yield a
bound orbit was $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ and had very little dependence on the
relative size of the planetesimals. Of these collisions, the collision energy
between two masses were $\gtrsim 10^3$ times the gravitational binding energy

energy is dissipated by the collision is $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ and the ratio of
collision energy to gravitational binding energy is sufficiently large enough

likely that for irregular satellites to be captured as a result of the
collision of planetesimals, only a small fraction of the colliding material
remained bound to the planet and would most likely be produced by a large mass
with a radius $\sim 100$ km colliding with a smaller mass with radius $\lesssim

multi-impurity models using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). To
calculate spectral functions from DMRG, the correction vector method is
presently the most widely used approach. One, however, always obtains
Lorentzian convoluted spectral functions, which in applications like the
dynamical mean-field theory can lead to wrong results. In order to overcome
this restriction we show how to use the Lehmann formula to calculate a peak
spectrum for the spectral function. We show that this peak spectrum is a very
good approximation to a deconvolution of the correction vector spectral
function. Calculating this deconvoluted spectrum directly from the DMRG basis
set and operators is the most natural approach, because it uses only
information from the system itself. Having calculated this excitation spectrum,
one can use an arbitrary broadening to obtain a smooth spectral function, or
directly analyze the excitations. As a nontrivial test we apply this method to
obtain spectral functions for a model of three coupled Anderson impurities.
Although, we are focusing in this article on impurity models, the proposed
method for calculating the peak spectrum can be easily adapted to usual lattice
models.

ferrite magnets, but it is usually impossible to get small grains and dense

predicted colours. These bolometric corrections and colour-transformations,
coupled to our theoretical isochrones with the appropriate chemical
composition, provide a complete and self-consistent set of theoretical
predictions for the effect of abundance variations on the observed cluster CMD.
CNO abundance variations affect mainly wavelengths shorter than 400 nm, due to
the arise of molecular absorption bands in cooler atmospheres. As a
consequence, colour and magnitude changes are largest in the blue filters,
independently of using broad or intermediate bandpasses. Colour-magnitude
diagrams involving uvy and UB filters (and their various possible colour
combinations) are thus the ones best suited to infer photometrically the
presence of multiple stellar generations in individual clusters. They are
particularly sensitive to variations in the N abundance, with the largest
variations affecting the Red Giant Branch (RGB) and lower Main Sequence (MS).
BVI diagrams are expected to display multiple sequences only if the different
populations are characterized by variations of the C+N+O sum and helium
abundance, that lead to changes in luminosity and effective temperature, but
leave the flux distribution above 400 nm practically unaffected. A variation of
just the helium abundance, up to the level we investigate here, affects
exclusively the interior structure of stars, and is largely irrelevant for the
atmospheric structure and the resulting flux distribution in the whole
wavelength range spanned by our analysis.

pulse delay with the so-called ""slow light"" resulting from the group velocity
reduction under conditions of the coherent population oscillations. It is shown
that all the known experimental data on the light pulse delay in saturable

by our sample (10^9 <M*<10^11 Msol, 7.5 <mu*<9.5 Msol kpc^-2, 2<NUV-r<6 mag).
These scaling relations are also followed by galaxies in the Virgo cluster,
although they are significantly offset towards lower gas content.
Interestingly, the difference between field and cluster galaxies gradually
decreases moving towards massive, bulge-dominated systems. By comparing our
data with the predictions of chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy
evolution, we show that starvation alone cannot explain the low gas content of
Virgo spirals and that only ram-pressure stripping is able to reproduce our
findings. Finally, motivated by previous studies, we investigate the use of a
plane obtained from the relations between the HI-to-stellar mass ratio, stellar
mass surface density and NUV-r colour as a proxy for the HI deficiency
parameter. We show that the distance from the `HI gas fraction plane' can be
used as an alternative estimate for the HI deficiency, but only if carefully

pose the usual prescription dilemma leading to different evolution equations

correspond to the well known mid-point (or any other intermediate)
prescription. By introducing an inertial term in the GLE we show that the Ito
and Stratonovich prescriptions naturally arise depending on two time scales,
the one induced by the inertial term and the other determined by the jump
event. We also show that when the multiplicative noise is linear in the random
variable one prescription can be made equivalent to the other by a suitable
transformation in the jump probability distribution. We apply these results to
a recently proposed stochastic model describing the dynamics of primary soil
salinization, in which the salt mass balance within the soil root zone requires
the analysis of different prescriptions arising from the resulting stochastic
differential equation forced by multiplicative white Poisson noise whose
features are tailored to the characters of the daily precipitation. A method is
finally suggested to infer the most appropriate prescription from the data.

Reisig, is often considered too detailed. The problem of defining a fully
satisfying more abstract concept of process for general place/transition
systems has so-far not been solved. In this paper, we recall the proposal of
defining an abstract notion of process, here called BD-process, in terms of
equivalence classes of Goltz-Reisig processes, using an equivalence proposed by
Best and Devillers. It yields a fully satisfying solution for at least all
one-safe nets. However, for certain nets which intuitively have different
conflicting behaviours, it yields only one maximal abstract process. Here we
identify a class of place/transition systems, called structural conflict nets,
where conflict and concurrency due to token multiplicity are clearly separated.
We show that, in the case of structural conflict nets, the equivalence proposed
by Best and Devillers yields a unique maximal abstract process only for
conflict-free nets. Thereby BD-processes constitute a simple and fully
satisfying solution in the class of structural conflict nets.

lensing if a simpler, linear calibration relation is assumed. We show that the

direction and magnitude depends on whether the point-spread function is narrow

Substantial over- or underestimates of the cosmological parameters are equally
possible, depending also on the variant of the KSB method. Our results show
that for trustable cosmological-parameter estimates from measurements of weak

ellipticity-dependent biases or monitor that the calibration relation inferred

through the U-channel based on the LKF is compared with previous quantum

system. During a seizure, a highly synchronized behavior of neural activity is
observed that can cause symptoms ranging from mild sensual malfunctions to the
complete loss of body control. In this paper, we aim to contribute towards a
better understanding of the dynamical systems phenomena that cause seizures.
Based on data analysis and modelling, seizure dynamics can be identified to
possess multiple spatial scales and on each spatial scale also multiple time
scales. At each scale, we reach several novel insights. On the smallest spatial
scale we consider single model neurons and investigate early-warning signs of
spiking. This introduces the theory of critical transitions to excitable
systems. For clusters of neurons (or neuronal regions) we use patient data and
find oscillatory behavior and new scaling laws near the seizure onset. These
scalings lead to substantiate the conjecture obtained from mean-field models
that a Hopf bifurcation could be involved near seizure onset. On the largest
spatial scale we introduce a measure based on phase-locking intervals and
wavelets into seizure modelling. It is used to resolve synchronization between
different regions in the brain and identifies time-shifted scaling laws at
different wavelet scales. We also compare our wavelet-based multiscale approach
with maximum linear cross-correlation and mean-phase coherence measures.

scattering and wave interference. Ultimately the so-called Anderson-localized
regime is reached when the waves become strongly confined in space. So far,
Anderson localization of light has been probed in transmission experiments by
measuring the intensity of an external light source after propagation through a
disordered medium. However, discriminating between Anderson localization and
losses in these experiments remains a major challenge. Here we present an
alternative approach where we use quantum emitters embedded in disordered
photonic crystal waveguides as light sources. Anderson-localized modes are
efficiently excited and the analysis of the photoluminescence spectra allows to
explore their statistical properties paving a way for controlling Anderson
localization in disordered photonic crystals.

many-body dynamics of complex magnetism is far from being well understood on a
fundamental level. Especially the study of geometrically frustrated
configurations is challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we
present the first realization of a large scale quantum simulator for magnetism
including frustration. We use the motional degrees of freedom of atoms to
comprehensively simulate a magnetic system in a triangular lattice. Via a
specific modulation of the optical lattice, we can tune the couplings in
different directions independently, even from ferromagnetic to
antiferromagnetic. A major advantage of our approach is that standard
Bose-Einstein-condensate temperatures are sufficient to observe magnetic
phenomena like N\'eel order and spin frustration. We are able to study a very
rich phase diagram and even to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by
frustration. In addition, the quantum states realized in our spin simulator are
yet unobserved superfluid phases with non-trivial long-range order and
staggered circulating plaquette currents, which break time reversal symmetry.
These findings open the route towards highly debated phases like spin-liquids
and the study of the dynamics of quantum phase transitions.

change with time, for instance when the agent updates them in the light of new
data. In this paper we address the question of how an agent's probabilities at
different times are constrained by Dutch-book coherence. We review and attempt
to clarify the argument that, although an agent is not forced by coherence to
use the usual Bayesian conditioning rule to update his probabilities, coherence
does require the agent's probabilities to satisfy van Fraassen's [1984]
reflection principle (which entails a related constraint pointed out by
Goldstein [1983]). We then exhibit the specialized assumption needed to recover
Bayesian conditioning from an analogous reflection-style consideration.
Bringing the argument to the context of quantum measurement theory, we show
that ""quantum decoherence"" can be understood in purely personalist
terms---quantum decoherence (as supposed in a von Neumann chain) is not a
physical process at all, but an application of the reflection principle. From
this point of view, the decoherence theory of Zeh, Zurek, and others as a story
of quantum measurement has the plot turned exactly backward.

other words, when we stare at a colored (or white) image for few seconds,
external photons can induce excited electronic states within different parts of
the eye that is followed by a delayed reemission of absorbed photons for
several seconds. Finally, these reemitted photons can be absorbed by
nonbleached photoreceptors that produce a negative afterimage. Although this
suggests the photobiophysical source of negative afterimages is related retinal
mechanisms, cortical neurons have also essential contribution in the
interpretation and modulation of negative afterimages.

a need for mathematical models and tools to systematically characterize the
reliability of the network. We propose two metrics for measuring the
reliability of wireless mesh routing topologies, one for flooding and one for
unicast routing. The Flooding Path Probability (FPP) metric measures the
end-to-end packet delivery probability when each node broadcasts a packet after
hearing from all its upstream neighbors. The Unicast Retransmission Flow (URF)
metric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when a relay node
retransmits a unicast packet on its outgoing links until it receives an
acknowledgement or it tries all the links. Both metrics rely on specific packet
forwarding models, rather than heuristics, to derive explicit expressions of
the end-to-end packet delivery probability from individual link probabilities
and the underlying connectivity graph.
  We also propose a distributed, greedy algorithm that uses the URF metric to
construct a reliable routing topology. This algorithm constructs a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) from a weighted, undirected connectivity graph, where each
link is weighted by its success probability. The algorithm uses a vector of
decreasing reliability thresholds to coordinate when nodes can join the routing
topology. Simulations demonstrate that, on average, this algorithm constructs a
more reliable topology than the usual minimum hop DAG.

derivatively-coupled Nambu-Goldstone-type scalars. We show, that black hole
formation in high energy scattering process represents classicalization with
the classicalization radius given by Schwarzschild radius of center of mass
energy, and with the precursor of black hole entropy being given by number of
soft quanta composing this classical configuration. Such an entropy-equivalent
is defined for scalar classicalons also and is responsible for exponential
suppression of their decay into small number of final particles. This parallel
works in both ways. For optimists that are willing to hypothesize that gravity
may indeed self-unitarize at high energies via black hole formation, it
illustrates that the Goldstones may not be much different in this respect, and
they classicalize essentially by similar dynamics as gravitons. In the other
direction, it may serve as an useful de-mystifier of
via-black-hole-unitarization process and of the role of entropy in it, as it
illustrates, that much more prosaic scalar theories essentially do the same.
Finally, it illustrates that in both cases classicalization is the defining
property for unitarization, and that it sets-in before one can talk about
accompanying properties, such as entropy and thermality of static classicalons
(black holes). These properties are by-products of classicalization, and their
equivalents can be defined for non-gravitational cases of classicalization.

Finding the correct energy spectrum is important because Kelvin waves play a

Furthermore, we present numerical results of the dynamical equation that

non-local predictions. Accordingly, the spectrum proposed in Ref. \cite{10LN}
should be used in future theories of quantum turbulence. Finally, for weaker
wave forcing we observe an intermittent behavior of the wave spectrum with a
fluctuating dissipative scale, which we interpreted as a finite-size effect
characteristic to mesoscopic wave turbulence.

preferences of energy hedging market participants. The resulting estimates are
applied to derive explicit risk aversion based optimal hedge strategies for
both short and long hedgers. Out-of-sample results are also presented based on
a unique approach that allows us to forecast risk aversion, thereby estimating

simulates dynamical abelianization in Yang-Mills theory (YM). It contains both
YM instantons and Wu-Yang monopoles and appears to be able to describe the
confining phase. Motivated by the meson degeneracy problem in dynamical
abelianization models, in this note we present a generalization of the FN
theory. We first generalize the Cho connection to dynamical symmetry breaking
pattern SU(N+1) -> U(N), and subsequently try to complete the Faddeev-Niemi
decomposition by keeping the missing degrees of freedom. While it is not
possible to write an on-shell complete FN decomposition, in the case of SU(3)
theory of physical interest we find an off-shell complete decomposition for
SU(3) -> U(2) which amounts to partial gauge fixing, generalizing naturally the
result found by Faddeev and Niemi for the abelian scenario SU(N+1) -> U(1)^N.
We discuss general topological aspects of these breakings, demonstrating for
example that the FN knot solitons never exist when the unbroken gauge symmetry
is nonabelian, and recovering the usual no-go theorems for colored dyons.

housing asset pricing. In so doing, the paper evaluates behavioral hypotheses
advanced by Case and Shiller (1988, 2002, 2009) in studies of boom and
post-boom housing markets. The paper specifies and tests a multi-factor housing
asset pricing model. In that model, we evaluate whether the market factor as
well as other measures of risk, including idiosyncratic risk, momentum, and MSA
size effects, have explanatory power for metropolitan-specific housing returns.
Further, we test the robustness of the asset pricing results to inclusion of
controls for socioeconomic variables commonly represented in the house price
literature, including changes in employment, affordability, and foreclosure
incidence. We find a sizable and statistically significant influence of the
market factor on MSA house price returns. Moreover we show that market betas
have varied substantially over time. Also, results are largely robust to the
inclusion of other explanatory variables, including standard measures of risk
and other housing market fundamentals. Additional tests of model validity using
the Fama-MacBeth framework offer further strong support of a positive risk and
return relationship in housing. Our findings are supportive of the application
of a housing investment risk-return framework in explanation of variation in
metro-area cross-section and time-series US house price returns. Further,
results strongly corroborate Case-Shiller survey research indicating the
importance of speculative forces in the determination of U.S. housing returns.

somewhat less market risk than equity; their betas against a broad market index
average about .65. Decomposing their covariances into principal components
reveals several strong factors. REIT characteristics differ to some extent from
those of the S&P/Case-Shiller (SCS) residential real estate indexes. This is
partly attributable to methods of index construction. Our examination of REITs
suggests that investment in real estate is far more risky than what might be
inferred from the widely-followed SCS series. REITs, unlike SCS series are
forward looking, and this helps them in the prediction of SCS returns. REIT
forecasts of SCS returns are reasonably precise over a number of periods.

conventional super-resolution techniques, such as the multiple signal
classification (MUSIC) and the estimation of signal parameters via rotation
invariance techniques (ESPRIT), our algorithm has several appealing features.
In particular, even in critical situations where the conventional
super-resolution techniques are not very powerful due to limited data or the
correlation between path coefficients, the LIMS algorithm can produce
successful results. In addition, due to its iterative nature, the LIMS
algorithm is suitable for recursive multipath tracking, whereas the
conventional super-resolution techniques may not be. Through numerical
simulations, we show that the LIMS algorithm can resolve the first arrival path
among closely arriving independently faded multipaths with a much lower mean
square error than can conventional early-late discriminator based techniques.
