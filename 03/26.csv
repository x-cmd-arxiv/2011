  and circumstellar dust","Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201016272",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By using self-consistent dynamic model atmospheres which simulate
pulsation-enhanced dust-driven winds of AGB stars we studied in detail the
influence of (i) pulsations of the stellar interiors, and (ii) the development
of dusty stellar winds on the spectral appearance of long period variables with
carbon-rich atmospheric chemistry. While the pulsations lead to large-amplitude
photometric variability, the dusty envelopes cause pronounced circumstellar
reddening. Based on one selected dynamical model which is representative of
C-type Mira variables with intermediate mass loss rates, we calculated
synthetic spectra and photometry for standard broad-band filters from the
visual to the near-infrared. Our modelling allows to investigate in detail the
substantial effect of circumstellar dust on the resultant photometry. The
pronounced absorption of amorphous carbon dust grains leads to colour indices
which are significantly redder than the corresponding ones based on hydrostatic
dust-free models. Only if we account for this circumstellar reddening we get
synthetic colours that are comparable to observations of evolved AGB stars. The
photometric variations of the dynamical model were compared to observed
lightcurves of the C-type Mira RU_Vir which appears to be quite similar to the
model. We found good agreement concerning the principal behaviour of the
BVRIJHKL lightcurves and also quantitatively fitting details. The analysed
model is able to reproduce the variations of RU_Vir and other Miras in (J-H)
vs. (H-K) diagrams throughout the light cycle. Contrasting the model photometry
with observational data for a variety of galactic C-rich giants in such
colour-colour diagrams proved that the chosen atmospheric model fits well into
a sequence of objects with increasing mass loss rates, i.e., redder colour
indices.

between, aim at reducing the bandwidth of SASE X-ray FELs. We recently proposed
to use a new method of monochromatization exploiting a single crystal in
Bragg-transmission geometry for self-seeding in the hard X-ray range. Here we
consider a possible extension of this method to the soft X-ray range using a
cell filled with resonantly absorbing gas as monochromator. The transmittance
spectrum in the gas exhibits an absorbing resonance with narrow bandwidth.
Then, similarly to the hard X-ray case, the temporal waveform of the
transmitted radiation pulse is characterized by a long monochromatic wake. In
fact, the FEL pulse forces the gas atoms to oscillate in a way consistent with
a forward-propagating, monochromatic radiation beam. The radiation power within
this wake is much larger than the equivalent shot noise power in the electron
bunch. Further on, the monochromatic wake of the radiation pulse is combined
with the delayed electron bunch and amplified in the second undulator. The
proposed setup is extremely simple, and composed of as few as two simple
elements. These are the gas cell, to be filled with noble gas, and a short
magnetic chicane. The installation of the magnetic chicane does not perturb the
undulator focusing system and does not interfere with the baseline mode of
operation. In this paper we assess the features of gas monochromator based on
the use of He and Ne. We analyze the processes in the monochromator gas cell
and outside it, touching upon the performance of the differential pumping
system as well. We study the feasibility of using the proposed self-seeding
technique to generate narrow bandwidth soft X-ray radiation in the LCLS-II soft
X-ray beam line. We present conceptual design, technical implementation and
expected performances of the gas monochromator self-seeding scheme.

with coefficients in a field $k$ containing the eigenvalues of $U$ as a sum
$U=D+N,$ where $D$ is a diagonalizable matrix and $N$ a nilpotent matrix which
commutes with $D.$ The most general version of this decomposition shows that
every separable element $u$ of a $k$-algebra $A$ can be written in a unique way
as a sum $u=d+n,$ where $d \in A$ is absolutely semi-simple and where $n\in A$
is nilpotent and commutes with $d.$ In fact an algorithm, due to C. Chevalley,
allows to compute this decomposition: this algorithm is an adaptation to this
context of the Newton method, which gives here the exact value of the
absolutely semi-simple part $d$ of $u$ after a finite number of iterations. We
illustrate the effectiveness of this method by computing the decomposition of a
$15 \times 15$ matrix having eigenvalues of multiplicity 3 which are not
computable exactly. We also discuss the other classical method, based on the
chinese remainder theorem, which gives the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition under
the form $u=q(u) +[u-q(u)],$ with $q(u)$ absolutely semi-simple, $u-q(u)$
nilpotent, where $q$ is any solution of a system of congruence equations
related to the roots of a polynomial $p\in k[x]$ such that $p(u)=0.$ It is
indeed possible to compute $q$ without knowing the roots of $p$ by applying the
algorithm discussed above to $\pi(x),$ where $\pi: k[x] \to k[x]/pk[x]$ is the
canonical surjection. We obtain this way after 2 iterations the polynomial $q$
of degree 14 associated to the $15\times 15$ matrix mentioned above. We justify
by historical considerations the use of the name ""Jordan-Chevalley
decomposition"", instead of the name ""Dunford decomposition"" which also appears
in the literature, and we discuss multiplicative versions of this decomposition
in semi-simple Lie groups. We conclude this paper showing why this
decomposition should play a central role in a linear algebra course, even at a
rather elementary level. Our arguments are based on a teaching experience of
more than 10 years in an engineering school located on the Basque Coast.

associated with gaps opened by a Saturn mass planet in a protoplanetary disc.
It is shown analytically and confirmed through linear calculations that vortex
modes with low azimuthal mode number $,m,$ are stabilised by increasing
self-gravity if the basic state is fixed. However, linear calculations show
that the combined effect of self-gravity through the background and through the
linear response shifts the most unstable vortex mode to higher $m.$ Nonlinear
hydrodynamic simulations of planetary gaps show more vortices develop with
increasing strength of self-gravity. For sufficiently large disc mass the
vortex instability is suppressed and replaced by a new global instability,
consistent with analytical expectations. In the nonlinear regime, vortex
merging is increasingly delayed as the disc mass increases and multiple
vortices may persist until the end of simulations. With self-gravity, the
post-merger vortex is localised in azimuth and has similar structure to a
Kida-like vortex. This is unlike the case without self-gravity where vortices
merge to form a single vortex extended in azimuth. We also performed a series
of supplementary simulations of co-orbital Kida-like vortices and found that
self-gravity enables such vortices to execute horseshoe turns upon encountering
each other. As a result vortex merging is avoided on time-scales where it would
occur without self-gravity. Thus we suggest that mutual repulsion of
self-gravitating vortices in a rotating flow is responsible for the delayed
vortex merging above. The effect of self-gravity on vortex-induced migration is
briefly discussed. We found that when self-gravity is included, the
vortex-induced type III migration of Lin & Papaloizou (2010) is delayed but the
extent of migration is unchanged.

protoplanetary disc. We find a linear instability associated with both the
self-gravity of the disc and local vortensity maxima which coincide with gap
edges. For our models, these edge modes develop and extend to twice the orbital
radius of a Saturn mass planet in discs with disc-to-star mass ratio >0.06,
corresponding to a Toomre Q < 1.5 at the outer disc boundary. Unlike the local
vortex-forming instabilities associated with gap edges in weakly or
non-self-gravitating low viscosity discs, the edge modes are global and exist
only in sufficiently massive discs, but for the typical viscosity values
adopted for protoplanetary discs. Analytic modelling and linear calculations
show edge modes may be interpreted as a localised disturbance associated with a
gap edge inducing activity in the extended disc, through the launching of
density waves excited at Lindblad resonances. Nonlinear hydrodynamic
simulations are performed to investigate the evolution of edge modes in
disc-planet systems. The form and growth rates of unstable modes are consistent
with linear theory. Their dependence on viscosity and gravitational softening
is also explored. We also performed a first study of the effect of edge modes
on planetary migration. We found that if edge modes develop, then the average
disc-on-planet torque becomes more positive with increasing disc mass. In
simulations where the planet was allowed to migrate, although a fast type III
migration could be seen that was similar to that seen in non-self-gravitating
discs, we found that it was possible for the planet to interact gravitationally
with the spiral arms associated with an edge mode and that this could result in
the planet being scattered outwards. Thus orbital migration is likely to be
complex and non monotonic in massive discs of the type we consider.

connected to its own metallic lead. For antiferromagnetic exchange coupling,
universal two-channel Kondo (2CK) physics is shown to arise at low energies.
Two overscreening mechanisms are found to occur depending on coupling strength,
with distinct signatures in physical properties. For strong inter-impurity
coupling, a residual chain spin-(1/2) moment experiences a renormalized
effective coupling to the leads; while in the weak-coupling regime, Kondo
coupling is mediated via incipient single-channel Kondo singlet formation. We
also investigate models where the leads are tunnel-coupled to the impurity
chain, permitting variable dot filling under applied gate voltages. Effective
low-energy models for each regime of filling are derived, and for even-fillings
where the chain ground state is a spin singlet, an orbital 2CK effect is found
to be operative. Provided mirror symmetry is preserved, 2CK physics is shown to
be wholly robust to variable dot filling; in particular the single-particle
spectrum at the Fermi level, and hence the low-temperature zero-bias
conductance, is always pinned to half-unitarity. We derive a Friedel-Luttinger
sum rule and from it show that, in contrast to a Fermi liquid, the Luttinger
integral is non-zero and determined solely by the `excess' dot charge as
controlled by gate voltage. The relevance of the work to real quantum dot
devices, where inter-lead charge-transfer processes fatal to 2CK physics are
present, is also discussed. Physical arguments and numerical renormalization
group techniques are used to obtain a detailed understanding of these problems.

sustained dynamo action and the self-generation of magnetic field when the
magnetic Reynolds number exceeds a critical value. For the plasma parameters of
the experiment, this field saturates at an amplitude corresponding to a new
stable equilibrium (a laminar dynamo). We show that compressibility in the
plasma results in an increase of the critical magnetic Reynolds number, while
inclusion of the Hall term in Ohm's law changes the amplitude of the saturated

identifies stellar companions by fitting a model to the observed transits.
Applying this model, that uses equations like Kepler's third law and an
empirical mass-radius relation, it is possible to estimate the mass and radius
of the primary and secondary objects as well as the semimajor axis and
inclination angle of the orbit. We focus on how the method can be used in the
characterisation of transiting systems having a low-mass stellar companion with
no need to be monitored with radial-velocity measurements or ground-based
photometric observations. The model, which provides a good estimate of the
system parameters, is also useful as a complementary approach to select
possible planetary candidates. A list of confirmed binaries together with our
estimate of their parameters are presented. The characterisation of the first
twelve detected CoRoT exoplanetary systems was also performed and agrees very

diffusive radiation flux is solely responsible for vertical heat transport.
This requires that heat must be generated at a critical rate per unit volume if
the disk is to be in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. This raises the
question of how heat is generated and how energy is transported in MHD
turbulence. By analysis of a number of radiation/MHD stratified shearing-box
simulations, we show that the divergence of the diffusive radiation flux is
indeed capped at the critical rate, but deep inside the disk, substantial
vertical energy flux is also carried by advection of radiation. Work done by
radiation pressure is a significant part of the energy budget, and much of this
work is dissipated later through damping by radiative diffusion. We show how
this damping can be measured in the simulations, and identify its physical
origins. Radiative damping accounts for as much as tens of percent of the total
dissipation, and is the only realistic physical mechanism for dissipation of
turbulence that can actually be resolved in numerical simulations of accretion
disks. Buoyancy associated with dynamo-driven, highly magnetized,
nearly-isobaric nonlinear slow magnetosonic fluctuations is responsible for the
radiation advection flux, and also explains the persistent periodic magnetic
upwelling seen at all values of the radiation to gas pressure ratio. The
intimate connection between radiation advection and magnetic buoyancy is the
first example we know of in astrophysics in which a dynamo has direct impact on
the global energetics of a system.

superconductors (HTSC) by inelastic neutron scattering (INS), are now widely
believed to be vital for the superconductivity. In two competing scenarios,
they either originate from local atomic spins, or are a property of cooperative
spin-density-wave (SDW) behavior of conduction electrons. Both assume clear
partition into localized electrons, giving rise to local spins, and itinerant
ones, occupying well-defined, rigid conduction bands. Here, by performing an
INS study of spin dynamics in iron telluride, a parent material of one of the
iron-based HTSC families, we have discovered that this very assumption fails,
and that conduction and localized electrons are fundamentally entangled. We
find that the real-space structure of magnetic correlations can be explained by
a simple local-spin plaquette model. However, the effective spin implicated in
such a model, appears to increase with the increasing temperature. Thus, we
observe a remarkable redistribution of magnetism between the two groups of
electrons, which occurs in the temperature range relevant for the
superconductivity. The analysis of magnetic spectral weight shows that the
effective spin per Fe at T \approx 10 K, in the antiferromagnetic phase,
corresponds to S \approx 1, consistent with the recent analyses that emphasize
importance of Hund's intra-atomic exchange. However, it grows to S \approx 3/2
in the disordered phase, a result that profoundly challenges the picture of
rigid bands, broadly accepted for HTSC.

the recovered halo mass does not seem to depend on the resolution of the

spin parameter evolution and fraction of mass in substructures are well
recovered. The mass of rescaled haloes can be underestimated (overestimated)
for negative (positive) variations of either sigma_8 or Omega_m, in a way that
does not depend on the halo mass. Statistics of abundances and correlation
functions of haloes show also small biases of <10 percent when moving away from
the base simulation by up to 2 times the uncertainty in the WMAP7 cosmological

in haloes also show small biases; the time since the last major merger, the
assembly time-scale, and a time-scale related to the stellar ages show
correlated biases which indicate that the spectral shapes of galaxies would
only be affected by global age changes of ~150 Myr. We show some of these
biases for different separations in the cosmological parameters with respect to
the desired cosmology so that these can be used to estimate the expected
accuracy of the resulting halo population. We also present a way to construct

out from a surface with a power-law density profile, \rho\propto x^n, is
numerically solved in the approximation of diffusion with constant opacity. For
an appropriate choice of time, length and energy scales, determined by the
breakout opacity, velocity and density, the solution is universal, i.e. depends
only on the density power law index n. The resulting luminosity depends weakly
on the value of n. An approximate analytic solution, based on the self-similar
hydrodynamic solutions and on the steady RMS solutions, is constructed and
shown to agree with the numerical solutions as long as the shock is far from
the surface, \tau>> c/v_{sh}. Approximate analytic expressions, calibrated
based on the exact solutions, are provided, that describe the escaping
luminosity as a function of time. These results can be used to calculate the
bolometric properties of the bursts of radiation produced during supernova (SN)

provide an analytic approximation for the maximum surface temperature for fast

plasma in AIA 131 \AA\ passband (peak temperature ~11 MK) rising from the core
of the source active region, rapidly moving outward and stretching upward the
surrounding background magnetic field. The stretched magnetic field seemed to
curve-in behind the core, similar to the classical magnetic reconnection
scenario in eruptive flares. On the other hand, the flux rope appeared as a
dark cavity in AIA 211 \AA\ passpand (2.0 MK) and 171 \AA\ passband (0.6 MK);
in these relatively cool temperature bands, a bright rim clearly enclosed the
dark cavity. The bright rim likely represents the pile-up of the surrounding
coronal plasma compressed by the expanding flux rope. The composite structure
seen in AIA multiple temperature bands is very similar to that in the
corresponding coronagraph images, which consists of a bright leading edge and a
dark cavity, commonly believed to be a flux rope.

is sufficient to detect all HII regions ionized by single O-stars to a distance

sky as does the previously known census of Galactic HII regions. On average,
however, the new nebulae have fainter continuum fluxes, smaller continuum
angular sizes, fainter RRL intensities and smaller RRL line widths. Though
small in angular size, many of our new nebulae show little spatial correlation
with tracers associated with extremely young HII regions, implying that our
sample spans a range of evolutionary states. We discovered 34 first quadrant
negative-velocity HII regions, which lie at extreme distances from the Sun and

of gravitational waveforms from binary black-hole systems with arbitrary
physical parameters, and thence the highest allowable initial orbital frequency
for a numerical-relativity simulation such that the combined analytical and
numerical waveform meets some minimum desired accuracy. The key strength of
this estimate is that no prior numerical simulation in the relevant region of
parameter space is needed, which means that these techniques can be used to
direct future work. The method is demonstrated for a selection of extreme
physical parameters. It is shown that optimal initial orbital frequencies
depend roughly linearly on the mass of the binary, and therefore useful
accuracy criteria must depend explicitly on the mass. The results indicate that
accurate estimation of the parameters of stellar-mass black-hole binaries in
Advanced LIGO data or calibration of waveforms for detection will require much
longer numerical simulations than are currently available or more accurate
post-Newtonian approximations -- or both -- especially for comparable-mass
systems with high spin.

interact with photons emitted by the Sun and be excited to a $\Delta^+$

muons and photons which may be detected with terrestrial detectors. A flux of
muons, photon pairs (from $\pi^0$ decay), or individual high-energy photons
coming from near the Sun would be a rather striking signature, and the flux of
these particles is a fairly direct measure of the flux of cosmic-ray nucleons,
independent of the cosmic-ray composition. In a solid angle within $15^\circ$

Using local operations on their respective systems and classical communication
(i.e. LOCC) it may be possible for the parties to transform deterministically
|\psi> into another joint state |\phi>. In the bipartite case, Nielsen
majorization theorem gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for this
process of entanglement transformation to be possible. In the multipartite
case, such a deterministic local transformation is possible only if both the
states in the same stochastic LOCC (SLOCC) class. Here we generalize Nielsen
majorization theorem to the multipartite case, and find necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of a local separable transformation
between two multipartite states in the same SLOCC class. When such a
deterministic conversion is not possible, we find an expression for the maximum
probability to convert one state to another by local separable operations. In
addition, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a
separable transformation that converts a multipartite pure state into one of a
set of possible final states all in the same SLOCC class. Our results are
expressed in terms of (1) the stabilizer group of the state representing the
SLOCC orbit, and (2) the associate density matrices (ADMs) of the two
multipartite states. The ADMs play a similar role to that of the reduced
density matrices, when considering local transformations that involves pure
bipartite states. We show in particular that the requirement that one ADM
majorize another is a necessary condition but in general far from being also
sufficient as it happens in the bipartite case.

observations of real social networks, we introduced a link-creating/deleting
strategy according to the local dynamics in the model. Thus the coevolution of
dynamics and topology naturally determines the network properties. It is found
that for a small coupling strength, the networked system cannot reach any
synchronization and the network topology is homogeneous. Interestingly, when
the coupling strength is large enough, the networked system spontaneously forms
communities with different dynamical states. Meanwhile, the network topology
becomes heterogeneous with modular structures. It is further shown that in a
certain parameter regime, both the degree and the community size in the formed
network follow a power-law distribution, and the networks are found to be
assortative. These results are consistent with the characteristics of many
empirical networks, and are helpful to understand the mechanism of formation of
modularity in complex networks.

more relevant for a category of objects and morphisms is an algebra of
morphisms. Therefore we prefer to say a category of graphs if every morphism is
a graph. In a monoidal category every morphism can be seen as a graph, and a
partial algebra of morphisms possesses a structure of an operad, operad of
graphs. We consider a monoidal category of operad of graphs with underlying
graphical calculus. If, in particular, there is a single generating objects,
then each morphism is a bi-arity graph. The graphical calculus, multi-grafting
of morphisms, is developed ab ovo. We interpret algebraic logic and predicate
calculus within a monoidal category of operad of graphs, and this leads to the
graphical logic. A logic based on a braided monoidal category is said to be the
braided logic. We consider a braided monoidal category generated by one object.
We are demonstrating how the braided logic is related to implicative algebra
and to the Heyting algebra (in contrary to the Boolean algebra) and therefore
must be more related to the quasigroups then to the lattices. Some applications
to classical logic, to modal logic and to Lukasiewicz three-valued logic are
considered.

functional brain connections. Statistical characterizations of these networks
aim to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small
number of network measures. Important functional network measures include
measures of modularity (measures of the goodness with which a network is
optimally partitioned into functional subgroups) and measures of centrality
(measures of the functional influence of individual brain regions).
Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity, but are
associated with several important methodological problems. These problems
include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional
networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity
partitions of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for
testing hypotheses of association between observed nontrivial network
properties and simple weighted connectivity properties. In this study we
describe a set of methods to overcome these problems. Specifically, we
generalize measures of modularity and centrality to fully connected and
weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate high-modularity
partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity null model
of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate
high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary
measures of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) networks from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access
repository of resting-state functional MRI datasets. Our methods may allow more
sound and reliable characterizations and comparisons of functional brain
networks across conditions and subjects.

the intensity of the pseudogap show strong temperature dependences: the sharp

$1-\tilde{N}(0,T)$, is getting deeper as temperature decreases. We observe also
that the total spectral weight of the electron-boson density and the mass
enhancement coefficient increase as temperature decreases. We estimate
fictitious (maximum) superconducting transition temperatures, $T_c(T)$, from

dependence; it is higher than the actual $T_c$ at all measured temperatures and

inspired by that of Jun Li but replacing predeformable maps by transversal maps
to a twisted target. The main advantage is a significant simplification in the
definition of the obstruction theory. We reprove in our language the
degeneration formula, extending it to the orbifold case.

of relay channels where the source wishes to transmit common and private
information to each of the destinations. This problem is recognized as being
equivalent to that of sending common and private information to several
destinations in presence of helper relays where each channel outcome becomes a
branch of the \emph{broadcast relay channel} (BRC). Cooperative schemes and
capacity region for a set with two memoryless relay channels are investigated.
The proposed coding schemes, based on \emph{Decode-and-Forward} (DF) and
\emph{Compress-and-Forward} (CF) must be capable of transmitting information
simultaneously to all destinations in such set.
  Depending on the quality of source-to-relay and relay-to-destination
channels, inner bounds on the capacity of the general BRC are derived. Three
cases of particular interest are considered: cooperation is based on DF
strategy for both users --referred to as DF-DF region--, cooperation is based
on CF strategy for both users --referred to as CF-CF region--, and cooperation
is based on DF strategy for one destination and CF for the other --referred to
as DF-CF region--. These results can be seen as a generalization and hence
unification of previous works. An outer-bound on the capacity of the general
BRC is also derived. Capacity results are obtained for the specific cases of
semi-degraded and degraded Gaussian simultaneous relay channels. Rates are
evaluated for Gaussian models where the source must guarantee a minimum amount
of information to both users while additional information is sent to each of
them.

Like all
particles, their contribution to the vacuum energy comes not only from their
bare kinetic energy but also from the interactions they have with other
gravitons. These interactions can be substantial -- despite the particles being
highly infrared -- because they occur over the enormous spatial volume of the
universe. Furthermore, the interactions grow with time evolution because more
and more such gravitons come into causal contact with one another. Since
gravity is universally attractive, these interactions can act to slow and
eventually stop accelerated expansion.

$M_\odot$ compact bodies in X-ray binary systems and of $10^5 - 10^9$ $M_\odot$
bodies at the center of many galaxies. All these objects are commonly
interpreted as black holes, even is there is no direct evidence that they have
an event horizon. A fundamental limit for a black hole in 4-dimensional general
relativity is the Kerr bound $|a_*| \le 1$, where $a_*$ is the spin parameter.
This is just the condition for the existence of the event horizon. The
accretion process can spin a black hole up to $a_* \approx 0.998$ and some
super-massive objects in galactic nuclei could be rapidly rotating black holes
with spin parameter close to this limit. However, if these super-massive
objects are not black holes, the Kerr bound does not hold and the accretion
process can spin them up to $a_* > 1$. In this paper, I consider compact bodies
with non-Kerr quadrupole moment. I study the evolution of the spin parameter
due to accretion and I find its equilibrium value. Future experiments like the
gravitational wave detector LISA will be able to test if the super-massive
objects at the center of galaxies are the black holes predicted by general
relativity. If they are not black holes, some of them may be super-spinning
objects with $a_* > 1$.

facts about extremal black holes, their Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and
attractor flows for single- and two-centered solutions.
