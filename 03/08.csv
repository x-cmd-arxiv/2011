the presence of an electric field, quarkonium has finite dissociation
probability. We use the WKB approximation to derive the dissociation
probability. We found that quarkonium dissociation energy, i.e. the binding
energy at which dissociation probability is of order unity, increases with the
magnetic field strength. It also increases with quarkonium momentum in the
laboratory frame due to Lorentz boost of electric field in the comoving frame.
As a consequence, J/Psi in plasma dissociates at lower temperature then it
would be in the absence of a magnetic field. We argue that J/Psi's produced in
heavy-ion collisions at LHC with P_T>9GeV would dissociate even in vacuum. In
plasma, J/Psi dissociation in magnetic field is much stronger due to decrease
of its binding energy with temperature. We discuss the phenomenological

non-matrix based sequent calculi, we transform many-valued logic into positive
2-valued multi-modal logic with classic conjunction, disjunction and finite set
of modal connectives. In this algebraic framework we define an uniquely

logic (DLL) by a new set of sequent axioms for many-valued logic connectives.
Dually, in an autoreferential Kripke-style framework we obtain a uniquely

available). Color and magnitude cuts have been made assuming an E(B-V) =0.55
mag +/- 0.1, which is a good approximation close to the center of Trumpler 16.
These lists have been cross-correlated with X-ray sources found in the Chandra
Carina Complex Project (CCCP). Previous studies have shown that only very
rarely (if at all) do late main sequence B stars produce X-rays. We present
evidence that the X-ray detected sources are binaries with low-mass companions,
since stars less massive than 1.4 Msun are strong X-ray sources at the age of
the cluster. Both the median X-ray energies and X-ray luminosities of these
sources are in good agreement with values for typical low-mass coronal X-ray
sources. We find that 39% of the late B stars based on a list with proper
motions have low-mass companions. Similarly, 32% of a sample without proper
motions have low-mass companions. We discuss the X-ray detection completeness.
These results on low-mass companions of intermediate mass stars are
complementary to spectroscopic and interferometric results, and probe new
parameter space of low mass companions at all separations. They do not support
a steeply rising distribution of mass ratios to low masses for

iron pnictide superconductors, FeSe with the PbO structure has received special
attention since there is not poisonous pnictogen element in chemical
composition and its structure is the simplest one. However, the superconducting
transition temperature (Tc) in iron chalcogenide compounds is not enhanced as
high as other iron pnictide superconductors under ambient pressure until the
superconductivity at above 30 K in potassium intercalated iron selenide
KxFe2-ySe2 was discovered. The insulating and the superconducting state are
both observed in KxFe2-ySe2 with different stoichiometries and some groups have
tuned the system from insulating to superconducting state by varying the ratio
of starting materials[10, 11]. The recent data from neutron scattering suggest
that the superconductivity may be built upon an ordered state of Fe vacancies
as well as the antiferromagnetic state with a very strong ordered magnetic
moment 3.4 B. Here we show that the superconductivity can actually be tuned on
a single sample directly from an insulating state by post-annealing and fast
quenching. Upon waiting for some days at room temperatures, the
superconductivity will disappear and the resistivity exhibits an insulating
behavior again. The spatial distribution of the compositions of the as-grown
sample and the post-annealed-quenched one was analyzed by the Energy Dispersive
X-ray Spectrum (EDXS) and found to be very close to each other. Therefore it is
tempting to conclude that the superconductivity is achieved when the
Fe-vacancies are in a random (disordered) state. Once they arrange in an
ordered state by relaxation or slow cooling, the system turns out to be an

generalization of Galileon interactions, which like the Galileons themselves
have a well-posed Cauchy problem. (3) We give a non-perturbative argument based
on the presence of additional symmetries that the full theory does not lead to
any extra degrees of freedom, suggesting that a 3D analog of the 4D
Boulware-Deser ghost is not present in this theory. Last but not least, we

gauge theory scattering amplitudes on momentum space. Although they arise as
the Feynman diagrams from an action on twistor space in an axial gauge, the
main ingredients were previously expressed only in momentum space and momentum
twistor space. Here we show how the formalism can be elegantly derived and
expressed entirely in twistor space. This brings out the underlying
superconformal invariance of the framework (up to the choice of a reference
twistor used to define the axial gauge) and makes the twistor support
transparent. Our treatment is largely independent of signature, although we
focus on Lorentz signature. Starting from the N=4 super-Yang-Mills twistor
action, we obtain the propagator for the anti-holomorphic Dolbeault-operator as
a delta function imposing collinear support with the reference twistor defining
the axial gauge. The MHV vertices are also expressed in terms of similar delta
functions. We obtain concrete formulae for tree-level N^{k}MHV diagrams as a
product of MHV amplitudes with an R-invariant for each propagator; here the
R-invariant manifests superconformal as opposed to dual-superconformal
invariance. This gives the expected explicit support on k+1 lines linked by k
further lines associated to the propagators. The R-invariants arising
correspond to those obtained in the dual conformal invariant momentum twistor
version of the formalism, but differences arise in the specification of the
boundary terms. Surprisingly, in this framework, some finite loop integrals can
be performed as simply as those for tree diagrams.

optimal attacks in this scenario are uncoordinated, i.e. the attackers link

also discuss optimal attack patterns for a group that wants to hide itself by
not pointing directly to the victim. In these disguised attacks, the attackers
link to nodes $l$ hops away from the victim. We show that an optimal disguised
attack exists and how it can be computed. The optimal disguised attack also
allows us to find optimal link farm configurations. A link farm can be
considered a special case of our approach: the target page of the link farm is
the victim and the other nodes in the link farm are the attackers for the
purpose of improving the rank of the victim. The target page can however
control its own outgoing links for the purpose of improving its own rank, which
can be modeled as an optimal disguised attack of 1-hop on itself. Our results

by extending symbolic execution to use behavioral contracts as symbolic values,
enabling symbolic approximation of higher-order behavior.
  Our approach is based on the idea of an abstract reduction semantics that
gives an operational semantics to programs with both concrete and symbolic
components. Symbolic components are approximated by their contract and our
semantics gives an operational interpretation of contracts-as-values. The
result is a executable semantics that soundly predicts program behavior,
including contract failures, for all possible instantiations of symbolic
components. We show that our approach scales to an expressive language of
contracts including arbitrary programs embedded as predicates, dependent
function contracts, and recursive contracts. Supporting this feature-rich
language of specifications leads to powerful symbolic reasoning using existing
program assertions.
  We then apply our approach to produce a verifier for contract correctness of
components, including a sound and computable approximation to our semantics
that facilitates fully automated contract verification. Our implementation is
capable of verifying contracts expressed in existing programs, and of
justifying valuable contract-elimination optimizations.

radio images show a very diverse population of group-central radio sources,
varying widely in size, power, morphology and spectral index. Comparison of the
radio images with Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray images shows that groups with
significant substructure in the X-ray band and marginal radio emission at >= 1
GHz host low-frequency radio structures that correlate with substructures in
IGM. Radio-filled X-ray cavities, the most evident form of AGN/IGM interaction
in our sample, are found in half of the systems, and are typically associated
with small, low- or mid-power double radio sources. Two systems, NGC5044 and
NGC4636, possess multiple cavities, which are isotropically distributed around
the group center, possibly due to group weather. In other systems the
radio/X-ray correlations are less evident. However, the AGN/IGM interaction can
manifest itself through the effects of the high-pressure medium on the
morphology, spectral properties and evolution of the radio-emitting plasma. In
particular, the IGM can confine fading radio lobes in old/dying radio galaxies
and prevent them from dissipating quickly. Evidence for radio emission produced
by former outbursts that coexist with current activity is found in six groups

conclusions is obtained by investigating the geometry of the traps that are
most effective at delaying the walk. A key element in proving our results is to
understand that, on large scales, the particle trajectory is essentially

central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications from high
temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic
materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally
intractable on classical computers due to the extreme complexity arising from
quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we employ a
degenerate Bose gas confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of
interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin
interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As
we vary an applied field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a
paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase
the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field which
aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase the interaction dominates and
produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed
through both in-situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements.
By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work
should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold
atoms, improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.

anomalous thick disk that was found by Gilmore et al. (2002); the halo velocity
peaks at a slightly prograde rotational velocity but there is also a
significant retrograde halo component in this field. The velocity distribution
in the northern field shows no evidence of Galactic rotation for |Z|>4 kpc and
a slight prograde motion for |Z|<4 kpc. The space densities of BHB stars in the

the effects of episodic accretion in simulations of star formation. Episodic
accretion results in bursts of radiative feedback, during which a protostar is
very luminous, and its surrounding disc is heated and stabilised. These bursts
typically last only a few hundred years. In contrast, the lulls between bursts
may last a few thousand years; during these lulls the luminosity of the
protostar is very low, and its disc cools and fragments. Thus, episodic
accretion enables the formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and
planetary-mass objects by disc fragmentation. If episodic accretion is a common
phenomenon among young protostars, then the frequency and duration of accretion
bursts may be critical in determining the low-mass end of the stellar initial

the MRI in protoplanetary disks using the strong coupling limit, which applies
when the electron recombination time is much shorter than the orbital time. The
effect of AD in this limit is characterized by the dimensionless number Am, the
frequency of which neutral particles collide with ions normalized to the
orbital frequency. We perform three-dimensional unstratified shearing-box
simulations of the MRI over a wide range of Am as well as different magnetic
field strengths and geometries. The saturation level of the MRI turbulence
depends on the magnetic geometry and increases with the net magnetic flux.
There is an upper limit to the net flux for sustained turbulence, corresponding
to the requirement that the most unstable vertical wavelength be less than the
disk scale height. Correspondingly, at a given Am, there exists a maximum value
of the turbulent stress alpha_max. For Am<1, the largest stress is associated
with a field geometry that has both net vertical and toroidal flux. In this
case, we confirm the results of linear analyses that show the fastest growing
mode has a non-zero radial wave number with growth rate exceeding the pure
vertical field case. We find there is a very tight correlation between the
turbulent stress (alpha) and the plasma beta=P_gas/P_mag~1/(2alpha) at the
saturated state of the MRI turbulence regardless of field geometry, and
alpha_max rapidly decreases with decreasing Am. In particular, we quote
alpha_max~0.007 for Am=1 and alpha_max~0.0006 for Am=0.1.

metal-poor than those of other catalogs of red giant star rotational
velocities, but the spectra generally only have signal-to-noise (S/N) of
~20-60, making the measurement of the widths of individual lines difficult. To
compensate for this, we have developed a cross-correlation method to derive
rotational velocities in moderate S/N echelle spectra to efficiently probe this

rotators as well as one extreme rapid rotator with a vsini of 86.4 km/s. Rapid

is a modification of the AdS metric in the vicinity of the infrared (IR) brane
corresponding to a strong deviation from conformality in the IR of the 4D
holographic dual. We compute the general low energy effective theory of the 5D
warped Standard Model, emphasizing additional IR contributions to the wave
function renormalization of the light Higgs mode. We also derive expressions
for the S and T parameters as a function of a generic 5D metric and zero-mode
wave functions. We give an approximate formula for the mass of the radion that
works even for strong deviation from the AdS background. We proceed to work out
the details of an explicit model and derive bounds for the first KK masses of
the various bulk fields. The radion is the lightest new particle although its
mass is already at about 1/3 of the mass of the lightest resonances, the KK
states of the gauge bosons. We examine carefully various issues that can arise
for extreme choices of parameters such as the possible reintroduction of the
hierarchy problem, the onset of nonperturbative physics due to strong IR
curvature or the creation of new hierarchies near the Planck scale. We conclude
that a KK scale of 1 TeV is compatible with all these constraints.

function of the angle of an in-plane applied magnetic field. We present

We conclude that when the current density $\bm J$ is neither parallel nor

make nanodiamond (ND) particles an attractive alternative to molecular dyes for
drug-delivery. Here we present a novel method for remote monitoring of chemical
processes in biological environment based on color changes from
photo-luminescent NV centers in ND. We propose to drive the NV luminescence
chemically, by alternating the surface electric field developed by interacting
atoms and molecules with the diamond surface. Due to the small ND size, the
developed electric field penetrates into the bulk of the nanoparticle and
intermingles with the electronic NV states. This allows construction of optical
chemo-biosensors operating in cells, visible in classical confocal microscopes.
We demonstrate this phenomenon on oxidized and hydrogenated ND as well as
single crystal diamond containing engineered NV centers. Hydrogenation of NDs
leads to quenching of luminescence related to negatively charged (NV-) centers
and by this way produces color shifts from NV- (636 nm) to neutral NV0 (575nm)
luminescence. We model how the reduction of diamond size increases the
magnitude of NV color shift phenomena.

The effective pinning potential is non-parabolic, which follows from the
magnetic field - dependent Labusch parameter $\alpha$. At the equilibrium (upon
field - cooling), $\alpha(H)$ is non-monotonic, but it is monotonic at a finite
gradient of the vortex density. This behavior leads to a faster magnetic
relaxation at the lower fields and provides a natural \emph{dynamic}
explanation for the fishtail (second peak) effect. We also find the evidence
for strong pinning at the lower fields. The inferred field dependence of the
pinning potential is consistent with the evolution from strong pinning, through
collective pinning and, eventually, to a disordered vortex lattice. The values
of $j_{c}(2\text{K}) \simeq 2\times10^{6}$ A/cm$^{2}$ provide an upper estimate
of the current carrying capability of LiFeAs. Overall, vortex behavior of
almost isotropic, fully-gapped LiFeAs is very similar to highly anisotropic

various aspects of the stellar populations that make up the galaxy's halo,
including their distances and metallicities. This study builds upon this
previous work by increasing the spatial coverage (something that has been
lacking in previous studies) and by searching for these variable stars in
constituents of the galaxy not yet explored. Besides the 55 RR Lyrae stars we
found in our initial field located 11kpc from the galactic nucleus, we find
additional RR Lyrae stars in four of the remaining five ultra deep fields as
follows: 21 in the disk, 24 in the giant stellar stream, 3 in the halo field
21kpc from the galactic nucleus, and 5 in one of the halo fields at 35kpc. No
RR Lyrae were found in the second halo field at 35kpc. The RR Lyrae populations
of these fields appear to mostly be of Oosterhoff I type, although the 11kpc
field appears to be intermediate or mixed. We will discuss the properties of
these stars including period and reddening distributions. We calculate

consider a model of a cognitive network where a secondary user can
cooperatively transmit with the primary user in order to improve the latter's
effective transmission rate. In return, the secondary user gets more
opportunities for transmitting its own data when the primary user is idle. This
kind of interaction between the primary and secondary users is different from
the traditional dynamic spectrum access model in which the secondary users try
to avoid interfering with the primary users while seeking transmission
opportunities on vacant primary channels. In our model, the secondary users
need to balance the desire to cooperate more (to create more transmission
opportunities) with the need for maintaining sufficient energy levels for their
own transmissions. Such a model is applicable in the emerging area of cognitive
femtocell networks. We formulate the problem of maximizing the secondary user
throughput subject to a time average power constraint under these settings.
This is a constrained Markov Decision Problem and conventional solution
techniques based on dynamic programming require either extensive knowledge of
the system dynamics or learning based approaches that suffer from large
convergence times. However, using the technique of Lyapunov optimization, we
design a novel greedy and online control algorithm that overcomes these
challenges and is provably optimal.

and consistently annotated datasets. By non-redundant, we mean that the
accounting of evidence for every interaction should be faithful: each
independent experimental support is counted exactly once, no more, no less.
While many interactions are shared among public repositories, none of them
contains the complete known interactome for any model organism. In addition,
the annotations of the same experimental result by different repositories often
disagree. This brings up the issue of which annotation to keep while
consolidating evidences that are the same. The iRefIndex database, including
interactions from most popular repositories with a standardized protein
nomenclature, represents a significant advance in all aspects, especially in
comprehensiveness. However, iRefIndex aims to maintain all
information/annotation from original sources and requires users to perform
additional processing to fully achieve the aforementioned goals.
  To address issues with iRefIndex and to achieve our goals, we have developed
ppiTrim, a script that processes iRefIndex to produce non-redundant,
consistently annotated datasets of physical interactions. Our script proceeds
in three stages: mapping all interactants to gene identifiers and removing all
undesired raw interactions, deflating potentially expanded complexes, and
reconciling for each interaction the annotation labels among different source
databases. As an illustration, we have processed the three largest organismal
datasets: yeast, human and fruitfly. While ppiTrim can resolve most apparent
conflicts between different labelings, we also discovered some unresolvable
disagreements mostly resulting from different annotation policies among
repositories.

identify the steady-state distribution of the chain by decoupling the chain to
smaller chains. The approximate solution is then used to understand the effect
of buffer sizes on throughput and distribution of packet delay. Further, we
classify nodes based on congestion that yields an intelligent scheme for memory

luminous optical emission line systems, and excess UV, while BCGs in other
clusters never show this activity. In this sample, we detect polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), extremely luminous, rotationally-excited
molecular hydrogen line emission, forbidden line emission from ionized gas ([Ne

dominate the heating of the dust and PAHs, a heating process consistent with
suprathermal electron heating from the hot gas, distinct from star formation,
is heating the molecular gas and contributing to the heating of the ionized gas
in the galaxies. The survival of PAHs and dust suggests that dusty gas is

the young massive star LS 2883. During the periastron passage the system
displays transient non-thermal unpulsed emission from radio to very high energy
gamma rays. It is one of the three galactic binary systems clearly detected at
TeV energies, together with LS 5039 and LS I +61 303. We observed PSR B1259-63
after the 2007 periastron passage with the Australian Long Baseline Array at
2.3 GHz to trace the milliarcsecond (mas) structure of the source at three
different epochs. We have discovered extended and variable radio structure. The
peak of the radio emission is detected outside the binary system near
periastron, at projected distances of 10-20 mas (25-45 AU assuming a distance
of 2.3 kpc). The total extent of the emission is ~50 mas (~120 AU). This is the
first observational evidence that non-accreting pulsars orbiting massive stars
can produce variable extended radio emission at AU scales. Similar structures
are also seen in LS 5039 and LS I +61 303, in which the nature of the compact
object is unknown. The discovery presented here for the young non-accreting
pulsar PSR B1259-63 reinforces the link with these two sources and supports the
presence of pulsars in these systems as well. A simple kinematical model
considering only a spherical stellar wind can approximately trace the extended
structures if the binary system orbit has a longitude of the ascending node of
omega ~ -40 deg and a magnetization parameter of sigma~0.005.

zero detuning, and from the invariance of the Floquet Hamiltonian under a

the infimum of all non-negative reals c such that the subfamily of F comprising
hypergraphs H with minimum degree at least $c \binom{|V(H)|}{r-1}$ has bounded
chromatic number. This parameter has a long history for graphs (r=2), and in
this paper we begin its systematic study for hypergraphs.
  {\L}uczak and Thomass\'e recently proved that the chromatic threshold of the
so-called near bipartite graphs is zero, and our main contribution is to
generalize this result to r-uniform hypergraphs. For this class of hypergraphs,
we also show that the exact Tur\'an number is achieved uniquely by the complete
(r+1)-partite hypergraph with nearly equal part sizes. This is one of very few
infinite families of nondegenerate hypergraphs whose Tur\'an number is
determined exactly. In an attempt to generalize Thomassen's result that the
chromatic threshold of triangle-free graphs is 1/3, we prove bounds for the
chromatic threshold of the family of 3-uniform hypergraphs not containing {abc,
abd, cde}, the so-called generalized triangle.
  In order to prove upper bounds we introduce the concept of fiber bundles,
which can be thought of as a hypergraph analogue of directed graphs. This leads
to the notion of fiber bundle dimension, a structural property of fiber bundles
that is based on the idea of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension in hypergraphs. Our
lower bounds follow from explicit constructions, many of which use a hypergraph
analogue of the Kneser graph. Using methods from extremal set theory, we prove
that these Kneser hypergraphs have unbounded chromatic number. This generalizes
a result of Szemer\'edi for graphs and might be of independent interest. Many
open problems remain.

degenerated when the density vanishes and the global weak solutions were got).

substantial number of weakly pinned vortices are induced in the YBCO layer by
the large out-of-plane stray field in the domain walls. Their motion gives rise
to large dissipation peaks at the coercive field. The angular dependent
magnetoresistance (MR) data reveal the interaction between the stripe domain
structure present in the LCMO layer and the vortices and anti-vortices induced
in the YBCO layer by the out-of-plane stray field. In addition, this study
shows that a superconducting surface spin valve effect is present in these
bilayers as a result of the relative orientation between the magnetization at
the LCMO/YBCO interface and the magnetization in the interior of the LCMO layer
that can be tuned by the rotation of a small $H$. This latter finding will
facilitate the development of superconductive magnetoresistive memory devices.
These low-magnetic field MR data, furthermore, suggest that triplet

The dependence of the ion momentum on time is consistent with the previous

relativistic RPA contains two acceleration processes: phase-stable limited
relativistic acceleration (PS-LRA) and URA. In PS-LRA, the potential is a deep
well trapping the ions. The ion front, i.e., the bottom, separates it into two
parts: the left half region is PSA region; the right half region is PSD region,
where the ions climb up and are decelerated to return back. In PS-LRA, the
maximum ion energy is limited. If the initial ion momentum large enough, ions
will experience a potential downhill and drop into a bottomless abyss, which is
called phase-lock-like position. URA is not phase-stable any more. At the
phase-lock-like position the ions can obtain unlimited energy gain and the ion
density is non-zero. You cannot have both PSA and URA.

next to another fascinating star: Balloon\,090100001. From this proximity, we
anticipated this star could pulsate in both high and low frequency modes.
Indeed, our analysis of photometric data confirmed our prediction. We detected
two peaks in the high frequency region and two other peaks at low frequencies.
In addition, the amplitude of the dominant mode is very high and comparable to
the dominant peaks in other hybrid subdwarf B stars. Since this star is bright,
we performed time-series low resolution spectroscopy. Despite a low
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, we were able to detect the main peak from these

correlated atoms that involve two or zero excitations. The mechanism inhibits
transitions into singly excited collective states of a two-atom system by
shifting them from their unperturbed energies. The shift is accomplished by the
dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms. The creation of the Bell state is
found to be dependent on the relaxation of the atomic excitation. When the
relaxation is not present or can be ignored, the state of the system evolves
harmonically between a separable to the maximally entangled state. We follow
the temporal evolution of the state and find that the concurrence can be
different from zero only in the presence of the dipole-dipole interaction.
Furthermore, in the limit of a large dipole-dipole interaction, the concurrence
reduces to that predicted for an X-state of the system. A general inequality is
found which shows that the concurrence of an X-state system is a lower bound
for the concurrence of the two-atom system. With the relaxation present, the
general state of the system is a mixed state that under a strong dipole-dipole
interaction reduces the system to an X-state form. We find that mixed states
admit of lower level of entanglement, and the entanglement may occur over a
finite range of time. A simple analytical expression is obtained for the
steady-state concurrence which shows that there is a threshold value for the
dipole-dipole interaction relative to the Rabi frequency of the driving field
above which the atoms can be entangled over the entire time of the evolution.

major goal is to determine {\eta}_Earth, the fraction of Sunlike stars that
have planets like Earth. When a planet 'transits' or moves in front of a star,
Kepler can measure the concomitant dimming of the starlight. From analysis of
the first four months of those measurements for over 150,000 stars, Kepler's
science team has determined sizes, surface temperatures, orbit sizes and
periods for over a thousand new planet candidates. In this paper, we
characterize the period probability distribution function of the super-Earth
and Neptune planet candidates with periods up to 132 days, and find three
distinct period regimes. For candidates with periods below 3 days the density
increases sharply with increasing period; for periods between 3 and 30 days the
density rises more gradually with increasing period, and for periods longer
than 30 days, the density drops gradually with increasing period. We estimate
that 1% to 3% of stars like the Sun are expected to have Earth analog planets,
based on the Kepler data release of Feb 2011. This estimate of is based on
extrapolation from a fiducial subsample of the Kepler planet candidates that we
chose to be nominally 'complete' (i.e., no missed detections) to the realm of
the Earth-like planets, by means of simple power law models. The accuracy of
the extrapolation will improve as more data from the Kepler mission is folded
in. Accurate knowledge of {\eta}_Earth is essential for the planning of future
missions that will image and take spectra of Earthlike planets. Our result that
Earths are relatively scarce means that a substantial effort will be needed to
identify suitable target stars prior to these future missions.

simulation study to compare the performance of several policies. The simulation

outperform the other policies, (b) randomized policies perform fairly close to

observations of distant z > 6 quasars allow to obtain information on the soft <

because of its cosmological redshift. Really the region of X-ray radiation is
insufficiently investigated because of high galactic absorption. In a result
one will get important information on the reionization zone of the Universe.
Astronomers from ESO revealed the effect of alignment of electric vectors of
polarized QSOs. One of the probable mechanism of such alignment is the
conversion of QSO radiation into low mass pseudoscalar particles (axions) in
the extragalactic magnetic field. These boson like particles have been
predicted by new SUSY particle physics theory. Since the probability of such
conversion is increasing namely in UV spectral range one can expect the strong
correlation between UV spectral energy distribution of QSO radiation and
polarimetric data in the optical range. In the stellar physics one of the
interesting problems is the origin of the X-ray sources with super Eddington
luminosities. The results of UV observations of these X-ray sources will allow
to find the origin of these sources as accreting intermediate mass black holes.

of the gravitons is to alter the density evolution of the cold dark matter
component in such a way that the Universe evolves to an accelerating expanding
regime, as presently observed. Tight constraints on the main cosmological
parameters of the MGCDM model are derived by performing a joint likelihood
analysis involving the recent supernovae type Ia data, the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) shift parameter and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs)
as traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) red luminous galaxies. The
linear evolution of small density fluctuations is also analysed in detail. It
is found that the growth factor of the MGCDM model is slightly different
($\sim1-4%$) from the one provided by the conventional flat $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. The growth rate of clustering predicted by MGCDM and $\Lambda$CDM
models are confronted to the observations and the corresponding best fit values
of the growth index ($\gamma$) are also determined. By using the expectations
of realistic future X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich cluster surveys we derive the
dark-matter halo mass function and the corresponding redshift distribution of
cluster-size halos for the MGCDM model. Finally, we also show that the Hubble
flow differences between the MGCDM and the $\Lambda$CDM models provide a halo
redshift distribution departing significantly from the ones predicted by other
DE models. These results suggest that the MGCDM model can observationally be
distinguished from $\Lambda$CDM and also from a large number of dark energy

cosmic topology is introduced. Like the circles-in-the-sky method using CMB
data, we work in a thin, shell-like region containing plenty of objects. Two
pairs of objects (quadruplet) linked by a holonomy show a specific distribution
pattern, and three filters of \emph{separation, vectorial condition}, and
\emph{lifetime of objects} extract these quadruplets. Each object $P_i$ is
assigned an integer $s_i$, which is the number of candidate quadruplets
including $P_i$ as their members. Then an additional device of $s_i$-histogram
is used to extract topological ghosts, which tend to have high values of $s_i$.
In this paper we consider flat spaces with Euclidean geometry, and the filters
are designed to constrain their holonomies. As the second filter, we prepared
five types that are specialized for constraining specific holonomies: one for
translation, one for half-turn corkscrew motion and glide reflection, and three
for $n$-th turn corkscrew motion for $n=4, 3,$ and 6. {Every multiconnected
space has holonomies that are detected by at least one of these five filters.}
Our method is applied to the catalogs of toy quasars in flat $\Lambda$-CDM
universes whose typical sizes correspond to $z\sim 5$. With these simulations
our method is found to work quite well. {These are the situations in which
type-II pair crystallography methods are insensitive because of the tiny number
of ghosts. Moreover, in the flat cases, our method should be more sensitive
than the type-I pair (or, in general, $n$-tuplet) methods because of its
multifilter construction and its independence from $n$.}

for highly non-Keplerian orbits. Three new applications of the orbital angular
momentum reversal (H-reversal) trajectories using solar sails are presented in
this paper: space observation, heliocentric orbit transfer, and collision
orbits with asteroids. A theoretical proof for the existence of double
H-reversal trajectories (referred to as 'H2RTs') is given, and the
characteristics of the H2RTs are introduced before the discussion of the
mission applications. A new family of H2RTs was obtained using a 3D dynamic
model of the two-body frame. In a time-optimal control model, the minimum
period H2RTs both inside and outside the ecliptic plane were examined using an
ideal solar sail. Due to the quasi-heliostationary property at its two
symmetrical aphelia, the H2RTs were deemed suitable for space observation. For
the second application, the heliocentric transfer orbit was able to function as
the time-optimal H-reversal trajectory, as its perihelion velocity is circular
or elliptic velocity. Such a transfer orbit can place the sailcraft into a
clockwise orbit in the ecliptic plane, with a high inclination or displacement
above or below the Sun. The third application of the H-reversal trajectory was
simulated impacting an asteroid passing near Earth in a head-on collision. The
collision point can be designed through selecting different perihelia or
different launch windows. Sample orbits of each application were presented
through numerical simulation. The results can serve as a reference for
theoretical research and engineering design.

are compared to the ones obtained with the nDS and HKN07 NLO nPDFs, and to the
corresponding nuclear modification factors of neutral pion production in these
collisions. The sensitivity of these results to the scale choice is also
investigated. Interestingly, the predictions using the different nPDF sets
differ from each other to the extent that this observable can be expected to
become very useful for probing nPDFs over a wide range of Bjorken-x. In order
to obtain a perturbative QCD baseline in heavy-ion collisions, calculations are
carried out for minimum bias Au-Au collisions at RHIC and Pb-Pb collisions at
the LHC. We also estimate the maximal possible suppression which the produced
QCD matter can be expected to have on inclusive prompt photon production due to
the quenching of the fragmentation component. The nuclear modification factor
for prompt photon production is thus suggested to be used for gauging both the
cold and the hot nuclear matter effects on other hard processes which are
expected to be affected by quark-gluon plasma formation, such as large-pT
hadron and jet production.

time-consuming process. In this paper, a new approach for the automatic
segmentation and volume determination of glioblastomas (glioblastoma
multiforme) is presented and evaluated. The approach uses a user-defined seed
point inside the glioma to set up a directed 3D graph. The nodes of the graph
are obtained by sampling along rays that are sent through the surface points of
a polyhedron. After the graph has been constructed, the minimal s-t cut is
calculated to separate the glioblastoma from the background. For evaluation, 12
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data sets were manually segmented slice by
slice, by neurosurgeons with several years of experience in the resection of
gliomas. Afterwards, the manual segmentations were compared with the results of
the presented approach via the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). For a better
assessment of the DSC results, the manual segmentations of the experts were
also compared with each other and evaluated via the DSC. In addition, the 12
data sets were segmented once again by one of the neurosurgeons after a period
of two weeks, to also measure the intra-physician deviation of the DSC.

absorption by neutral hydrogen. The new data allow a combined spectral fitting
to the Swift UVOT and the XMM-Newton/ROSAT data which results in a huge
luminosity of (6.2+-0.2)x10^47 erg s^(-1) and alpha_ox values ranging between

nearest-neighbor parameter $t_{0}(1+\delta)$ for short bonds and
$t_{0}(1-\delta)$ for long bonds, and long-range electron-electron
interactions. We follow the time evolution of the spin and charge using
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group technique, when a hole is
injected at one end of the chain in its ground state. We find that spin and
charge dynamics followed through spin and charge velocities, depend both on
chain length and extent of dimerization, $\delta$. Analysis of the results
requires focusing on physical quantities such as average spin and charge
polarizations, particularly in the large dimerization limit. In the
dimerization range 0.0 $\le$ $\delta$ $\le$ 0.15, spin-charge dynamics is found
to have a well defined behavior, with spin-charge separation (measured as the
ratio of charge velocity to spin velocity) as well as, the total amount of
charge and spin transported in a given time, along the chain, decreasing as
dimerization increases. However, in the range 0.3 $\le$ $\delta$ $\le$ 0.5, it
is observed that the dynamics of spin and charge transport becomes complicated.
It is observed that for large $\delta$ values, spin-charge separation is
suppressed and the injected hole fails to travel the entire length of the
chain.

hole low-mass X-ray binaries. The latter goal will, in addition, be obtained by
significantly enlarging the number of black hole systems for which a black hole
mass can be derived. Further goals include constraining X-ray binary formation
scenarios, in particular the common envelope phase and the occurrence of kicks,
via source-type number counts and an investigation of the spatial distribution
of X-ray binaries, respectively. The GBS targets two strips of 6x1 degrees (12
square degrees in total), one above (1<b<2 degrees) and one below (-2<b<-1
degrees) the Galactic plane in the direction of the Galactic Center at both
X-ray and optical wavelengths. By avoiding the Galactic plane (-1<b<1 degrees)
we limit the influence of extinction on the X-ray and optical emission but
still sample relatively large number densities of sources. The survey is
designed such that a large fraction of the X-ray sources can be identified from
their optical spectra. The X-ray survey, by design, covers a large area on the

maximize the predicted number ratio of (quiescent) low-mass X-ray binaries to
Cataclysmic Variables. The survey is approximately homogeneous in depth to an

challenge for nonparametric methods in statistics, with powerful applications

determine whether random shots hit the body, Cuevas et al. [Ann. Statist. 35

planar sets and the surface area for 3-dimensional objects) via the
consideration of shots at a box containing the body. The statistics considered
by these authors, as well as those in subsequent papers, are based on the
estimation of Minkowski content and depend on a smoothing parameter which must
be carefully chosen. For the same sampling scheme, we introduce a new approach
which bypasses this issue, providing strongly consistent estimators of both the
boundary measure and the surface integrals of scalar functions, provided one
can collect the function values at the sample points. Examples arise in
experiments in which the density of the body can be measured by physical
properties of the impacts, or in situations where such quantities as
temperature and humidity are observed by randomly distributed sensors. Our
method is based on random Delaunay triangulations and involves a simple
procedure for surface reconstruction from a dense cloud of points inside and
outside the body. We obtain basic asymptotics of the estimator, perform
simulations and discuss, via Google Earth's data, an application to the image

evolution of statistical systems. It has been explained from very different
perspectives. In statistical physics, it is obtained from the principle of
maximum entropy. In the same context, it can also be derived without any
consideration about information theory, only from geometrical arguments under
the hypothesis of equiprobability in phase space. Also, several multi-agent
economic models based on mappings, with random, deterministic or chaotic
interactions, can give rise to the asymptotic appearance of the exponential
wealth distribution. An alternative approach to this problem in the framework
of iterations in the space of distributions has been recently presented.
Concretely, the new iteration given by $ f_{n+1}(x) =
\int\int_{u+v>x}{f_n(u)f_n(v)\over u+v} dudv.$. It is found that the
exponential distribution is a stable fixed point of the former functional

system models that are not exactly solvable can use our derived evolution
equation to easily obtain their two-time CF's of system operators, valid to
second order in the system-environment interaction. Since the form and nature
of the Hamiltonian are not specified in our derived evolution equation, our
evolution equation is applicable for bosonic and/or fermionic environments and
can be applied to a wide range of system-environment models with any factorized
(separable) system-environment initial states (pure or mixed). When applied to
a general model of a system coupled to a finite-temperature bosonic environment
with a system coupling operator L in the system-environment interaction
Hamiltonian, the resultant evolution equation is valid for both L = L^+ and L
\neq L^+ cases, in contrast to those evolution equations valid only for L = L^+
case in the literature. The derived equation that generalizes the quantum
regression theorem (QRT) to the non-Markovian case will have broad applications
in many different branches of physics. We then give conditions on which the QRT
holds in the weak system-environment coupling case, and apply the derived
evolution equation to a problem of a two-level system (atom) coupled to a
finite-temperature bosonic environment (electromagnetic fields) with L \neq

side-chain placement problem consists of choosing a side-chain placement for
each residue position such that the resulting overall energy is minimum. The
choice of the side-chain then also determines the amino acid for this position.
Many algorithms for this NP-hard problem have been proposed in the context of
homology modeling, which, however, reach their limits when faced with large
protein design instances.
  In this paper, we propose a new exact method for the side-chain placement
problem that works well even for large instance sizes as they appear in protein
design. Our main contribution is a dedicated branch-and-bound algorithm that
combines tight upper and lower bounds resulting from a novel Lagrangian
relaxation approach for side-chain placement. Our experimental results show
that our method outperforms alternative state-of-the art exact approaches and
makes it possible to optimally solve large protein design instances routinely.

applications in science, finance and engineering. This chapter reviews some of
these algorithms, emphasizing the so-called regularization algorithms for
linear conic optimization, and applications in polynomial optimization. This is
a presentation of the material of several recent research articles; we aim here
at clarifying the ideas, presenting them in a general framework, and pointing
out important techniques.

magneto-induced optical second harmonic generation and the magneto-optical Kerr

pronounced differences in the transient changes of the surface and bulk
sensitive magneto-optical signals which we attribute to transfer of optically
excited, spin-polarized carriers between surface and bulk states of the
Gd(0001) film. A fluence dependent analysis of the bulk magnetization dynamics
results in a weak variation of the demagnetization time constant, which starts
at about 700 fs and increases by 10% within a fluence variation up to 1 mJ/cm2.
We compare these results with fluence dependent changes in the transient energy
density calculated by the two temperature model. The determined characteristic
times of excess energy transfer from the electron system to the lattice, which
is mediated by e-ph scattering, range from 0.2 - 0.6 ps. Such a more pronounced
fluence dependent change in the characteristic time compared to the observed
rather weakly varying demagnetization times suggests a more advanced
description of the optically excited state than by the two-temperature model.

account within the diffusion approximation. Realistic equation of state and
opacities are implemented, allowing the study of a wide range of problems
characteristic of stellar interiors. We describe in details the numerical
method and various standard tests performed to validate the method. We present
preliminary results devoted to the description of stellar convection. We first
perform a local simulation of convection in the surface layers of a A-type star
model. This simulation is used to test the ability of the code to address
stellar conditions and to validate our results, since they can be compared to
similar previous simulations based on explicit codes. We then present a global
simulation of turbulent convective motions in a cold giant envelope, covering
80% in radius of the stellar structure. Although our implicit scheme is
unconditionally stable, we show that in practice there is a limitation on the
time step which prevent the flow to move over several cells during a time step.
Nevertheless, in the cold giant model we reach a hydro CFL number of 100. We
also show that we are able to address flows with a wide range of Mach numbers
(10^-3 < Ms< 0.5), which is impossible with an anelastic approach. Our first
developments are meant to demonstrate that the use of an implicit scheme

estimators achieve the best convergence rate. Moreover, we show that the
proposed method is much more efficient than the least-squares-based method for

quantum communication, quantum networking and distributed quantum computing.
The required optical quantum memory must, first, be able to receive and
recreate the photonic qubit and, second, store an unknown quantum state of
light better than any classical device. These two requirements have so far been
met only by ensembles of material particles storing the information in
collective excitations. Recent developments, however, have paved the way for a
new approach in which the information exchange happens between single quanta of
light and matter. This single-particle approach allows one to address the
material qubit and thus has fundamental advantages for realistic
implementations: First, to combat inevitable losses and finite efficiencies, it
enables a heralding mechanism that signals the successful storage of a photon
by means of state detection. Second, it allows for individual qubit
manipulations, opening up avenues for in situ processing of the stored quantum
information. Here we demonstrate the most fundamental implementation of such a
quantum memory by mapping arbitrary polarization states of light into and out
of a single atom trapped inside an optical cavity. The memory performance is
analyzed through full quantum process tomography. The average fidelity is
measured to be 93% and low decoherence rates result in storage times exceeding
180\mu s. This makes our system a versatile quantum node with excellent
perspectives for optical quantum gates and quantum repeaters.

was adopted by the World Chess Federation over four decades ago. Although not
without controversy, it is accepted as generally reliable and provides a method
for assessing players' strengths and ranking them in official tournaments.
  It is generally accepted that the distribution of players' rating data is
approximately normal but, to date, no stochastic model of how the distribution
might have arisen has been proposed. We propose such an evolutionary stochastic
model, which models the arrival of players into the rating pool, the games they
play against each other, and how the results of these games affect their
ratings. Using a continuous approximation to the discrete model, we derive the
distribution for players' ratings at time $t$ as a normal distribution, where
the variance increases in time as a logarithmic function of $t$. We validate
the model using published rating data from 2007 to 2010, showing that the
parameters obtained from the data can be recovered through simulations of the
stochastic model.
  The distribution of players' ratings is only approximately normal and has
been shown to have a small negative skew. We show how to modify our
evolutionary stochastic model to take this skewness into account, and we
validate the modified model using the published official rating data.

the former case, the time-averaged density matrix and the real-time evolution

antiquarks, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) suggests the existence of the hybrid
hadrons containing valence gluons in addition to the quarks and antiquarks, and
some experiments may have found some. A decisive experimental confirmation of
its existence, however, is still needed. At present, lattice simulations have
offered the practicable ways of theoretically guiding us to search for the
hybrid states.
  In this dissertation, we study the spectroscopy and the decay rate of the
heavy hybrid mesons made of a heavy $b$ quark, a heavy $\bar b$ antiquark, and
a gluon ($b\bar{b}g$) to selected channels, and use lattice methods to extract
the transition matrix elements in full QCD. We are particular interested in the
spin-exotic hybrid mesons.
  For sufficiently heavy quarks (e.g., $b$ quark), we use the leading
Born-Oppenheimer (LBO) approximation to calculate the static potential energy
at all $b\bar{b}$ separations. Then, by solving the Schr\""odinger equation with
this potential, we reconstruct the motion of the heavy quarks. In a similar way
we can determine decay rates. In this dissertation, we use the numerical
lattice method to calculate the mass of the $f_0$ meson at a single lattice
spacing and light quark mass, namely, $m_{f_0} = (768 \pm 136)$ MeV. Most of
all we consider the decay channels involving the production of a scalar meson.
We obtain the partial decay rate ($\Gamma$) for the channel $ H \rightarrow
\chi_b + \pi + \pi $, namely, $ \Gamma = 3.62(98)$ MeV. All of our results are
consistent with those of other researchers. Knowledge of the masses and the
decay rates should help us considerably in experimental searches for the hybrid
mesons.

(restrictions on the hypergraph of constraint scopes) and relational properties
(restrictions on the language of constraint relations). Recently, some authors
have considered hybrid properties that restrict the constraint hypergraph and
the relations simultaneously.
  Our key contribution is the novel concept of a CSP pattern and classes of
problems defined by forbidden patterns (which can be viewed as forbidding
generic subproblems). We describe the theoretical framework which can be used
to reason about classes of problems defined by forbidden patterns. We show that
this framework generalises relational properties and allows us to capture known
hybrid tractable classes.
  Although we are not close to obtaining a dichotomy concerning the
tractability of general forbidden patterns, we are able to make some progress
in a special case: classes of problems that arise when we can only forbid
binary negative patterns (generic subproblems in which only inconsistent tuples
are specified). In this case we are able to characterise very large classes of
tractable and NP-hard forbidden patterns. This leaves the complexity of just
one case unresolved and we conjecture that this last case is tractable.

methods for solving the inhomogeneous Zerilli equation in time-domain. The
developed hybrid method decomposes the domain into the spectral and
finite-difference domains. The singular source term is located in the spectral
domain while the solution in the region without the singular term is
approximated by the higher-order finite-difference method.
  The spectral domain is also split into multi-domains and the
finite-difference domain is placed as the boundary domain. Due to the global
nature of the spectral method, a multi-domain method composed of the spectral
domains only does not yield the proper power-law decay unless the range of the
computational domain is large. The finite-difference domain helps reduce
boundary effects due to the truncation of the computational domain. The
multi-domain approach with the finite-difference boundary domain method reduces
the computational costs significantly and also yields the proper power-law
decay.
  Stable and accurate interface conditions between the finite-difference and
spectral domains and the spectral and spectral domains are derived. For the
singular source term, we use both the Gaussian model with various values of
full width at half maximum and a localized discrete $\delta$-function. The
discrete $\delta$-function was generalized to adopt the Gauss-Lobatto
collocation points of the spectral domain.
  The gravitational waveforms are measured. Numerical results show that the
developed hybrid method accurately yields the quasi-normal modes and the
power-law decay profile. The numerical results also show that the power-law
decay profile is less sensitive to the shape of the regularized
$\delta$-function for the Gaussian model than expected. The Gaussian model also

  Perspective",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Internet users such as individuals and organizations are subject to different
types of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, spams, and botnets. To reduce
the probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in traditional
security mechanisms like anti-virus and anti-spam software, sometimes also
known as self-defense mechanisms. However, such software does not completely
eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of residual risk
elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In this regard, an
important research problem is the analysis of optimal user self-defense
investments and cyber-insurance contracts under the Internet environment. In
this paper, we investigate two problems and their relationship: 1) analyzing
optimal self-defense investments in the Internet, under optimal cyber-insurance
coverage, where optimality is an insurer objective and 2) designing optimal
cyber-insurance contracts for Internet users, where a contract is a (premium,
coverage) pair.

rapidly change, launched by the newly formed neutron star in a core collapse
supernova can explode the star. We show that under a wide range of parameters
the fast narrow jets deposit their energy inside the star via shock waves, and
form two hot bubbles, that eventually merge, accelerate the rest of the star
and lead to the explosion. To prevent the jets from penetrating through the
collapsing stellar core and escape with their energy, instead of forming the
hot bubbles, the jets should be prevented from drilling a hole through the
star. This condition can be met if the jets' axis rapidly changes its
direction. This process of depositing jets' energy into the ambient medium is
termed the it penetrating jet feedback mechanism. The feedback exists in that
the neutron star (or a black hole) at the center of the core collapse supernova
shuts off its own growth by exploding the star. The jets deposit their energy
at a distance of 1000 km from the center and expel the mass above that radius.
In our model, the material near the stalled shock at several hundreds
kilometers from the center is not expelled, but it is rather accreted and feed
the accretion disk that blows the jets. The neutrinos might influence the
accretion flow, but in the proposed model their role in exploding the star is
small.

stars are discussed in terms of the merger of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf with
a helium white dwarf. The model is expressed as a linear mixture of the
individual layers of both constituent white dwarfs, taking account of the
specific evolution of each star. In developing this recipe from previous
versions, particular attention has been given to the inter-shell abundances of
the asymptotic giant branch star which evolved to become the carbon-oxygen
white dwarf. Thus the surface composition of the merged star is estimated as a
function of the initial mass and metallicity of its progenitor. The question of
whether additional nucleosynthesis occurs during the white dwarf merger has
been examined.
  The high observed abundances of carbon and oxygen must either originate by
dredge-up from the core of the carbon-oxygen white dwarf during a cold merger
or be generated directly by alpha-burning during a hot merger. The presence of
large quantities of O18 may be consistent with both scenarios, since a
significant O18 pocket develops at the carbon/helium boundary in a number of
our post-AGB models.
  The production of fluorine, neon and phosphorus in the AGB intershell
produces n overabundance at the surface of the merged stars, but generally not
in sufficient quantity. However, the evidence for an AGB origin for these
elements points to progenitor stars with initial masses in the range 1.9 - 3
solar masses.
  There is not yet sufficient information to discriminate the origin (fossil or
prompt) of all the abundance anomalies observed in EHe and RCB stars. Further
work is required on argon and s-process elements in the AGB intershell, and on
the predicted yields of all elements from a hot merger.

condensates (BECs) loaded into optical lattices, are often described by the
nonlinear Schr\""odinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a sinusoidal potential.
Here, we consider a model based on such a periodic potential, with the
nonlinearity (attractive or repulsive) concentrated either at a single point or
at a symmetric set of two points, which are represented, respectively, by a
single {\delta}-function or a combination of two {\delta}-functions. This model
gives rise to ordinary solitons or gap solitons (GSs), which reside,
respectively, in the semi-infinite or finite gaps of the system's linear
spectrum, being pinned to the {\delta}-functions. Physical realizations of
these systems are possible in optics and BEC, using diverse variants of the
nonlinearity management. First, we demonstrate that the single
{\delta}-function multiplying the nonlinear term supports families of stable
regular solitons in the self-attractive case, while a family of solitons
supported by the attractive {\delta}-function in the absence of the periodic
potential is completely unstable. We also show that the {\delta}-function can
support stable GSs in the first finite gap in both the self-attractive and
repulsive models. The stability analysis for the GSs in the second finite gap
is reported too, for both signs of the nonlinearity. Alongside the numerical
analysis, analytical approximations are developed for the solitons in the
semi-infinite and first two finite gaps, with the single {\delta}-function
positioned at a minimum or maximum of the periodic potential. In the model with
the symmetric set of two {\delta}-functions, we study the effect of the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the pinned solitons. Two configurations are
considered, with the {\delta}-functions set symmetrically with respect to the

of an electrical circuit, one is faced with three special situations: 1. The
system involves external (control) forcing through external (controlled)
voltage sources and resistors. 2. The system is constrained via the Kirchhoff
current (KCL) and voltage laws (KVL). 3. The Lagrangian is degenerate. Based on
a geometric setting, an appropriate variational formulation is presented to
model the circuit from which the equations of motion are derived. A
time-discrete variational formulation provides an iteration scheme for the
simulation of the electric circuit. Dependent on the discretization, the
intrinsic degeneracy of the system can be canceled for the discrete variational
scheme. In this way, a variational integrator is constructed that gains several
advantages compared to standard integration tools for circuits; in particular,
a comparison to BDF methods (which are usually the method of choice for the
simulation of electric circuits) shows that even for simple LCR circuits, a
better energy behavior and frequency spectrum preservation can be observed
using the developed variational integrator.

  Criticality, and the Renormalization Group",,,,,"q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  To set the stage for viewing Consciousness in terms of brain phase space
dynamics and criticality, I will first review currently prominent theoretical
conceptualizations and, where appropriate, identify ill-advised and flawed
notions in Theoretical Neuroscience that may impede viewing Consciousness as a
phenomenon in Physics. I will furthermore introduce relevant facts that tend
not to receive adequate attention in much of the current Consciousness
discourse. As a new approach to conceptualizing Consciousness, I propose
considering it as a collective achievement of the brain' s complex neural
dynamics that is amenable to study in the framework of state space dynamics and
criticality. In Physics, concepts of phase space transitions and the
Renormalization Group are powerful tools for interpreting phenomena involving
many scales of length and time in complex systems. The significance of these
concepts lies in their accounting for the emergence of different levels of new
collective behaviors in complex systems, each level with its distinct ontology,
organization and laws, as a new pattern of reality. The presumption of this
proposal is that the subjectivity of Consciousness is the epistemic
interpretation of a level of reality that originates in phase transitions of
the brain-body-environment system.
