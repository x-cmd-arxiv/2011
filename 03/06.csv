Extended Objects"" by Goldberger and Rothstein in order to investigate theories
of gravity and to take a different point of view on the physical information
that can be extracted from experiments. In the first work I present, I study a
scalar-tensor theory of gravity and I address the renormalization of the
energy-momentum tensor for point-like and string-like sources. The second and
third study I report are set in the context of testing gravity. So far
experiments have probed dynamical regimes only up to order (v/c)^5 in the
post-Newtonian expansion, which corresponds to the very first term of the
radiative sector in General Relativity. In contrast, by means of
gravitational-wave astronomy, one aims at testing General Relativity up to
(v/c)^(12)! It is then relevant to envisage testing frameworks which are
appropriate to this strong-field/radiative regime. In the last two chapters of
this thesis a new such framework is presented. Using the effective field theory
approach, General Relativity non-linearities are described by Feynman diagrams
in which classical gravitons interact with matter sources and among themselves.
Tagging the self-interaction vertices of gravitons with parameters it is
possible, for example, to translate the measure of the period decay of
Hulse-Taylor pulsar in a constraint on the three-graviton vertex at the 0.1%
level; for comparison, LEP constraints on the triple-gauge-boson couplings of
weak interactions are accurate at 3%. With future observations of gravitational
waves, higher order graviton vertices can in principle be constrained through a
Fisher matrix analysis.

Effective Theory (SCET) Lagrangian to include Glauber modes, which are needed
to implement the interactions between the medium and the collinear fields. We
derive the Feynman rules for this Lagrangian and show that it is invariant
under soft and collinear gauge transformations. We find that the newly
constructed theory SCET$_{\rm G}$ recovers exactly the general result for the
transverse momentum broadening of jets. In the limit where the radiated gluons
are significantly less energetic than the parent quark, we obtain a jet
energy-loss kernel identical to the one discussed in the reaction operator
approach to parton propagation in matter. In the framework of SCET$_{\rm G}$ we
present results for the fully-differential bremsstrahlung spectrum for both the
incoherent and the Landau-Pomeranchunk-Migdal suppressed regimes beyond the
soft-gluon approximation. Gauge invariance of the physics results is
demonstrated explicitly by performing the calculations in both the light-cone

to involve `composite electrons' in the ion inertial (Hall current) domain, a
tiny fraction of electrons only. These `composite electrons' are confined to
lower Landau levels $\epsilon_L\ll T_e$ (energy much less than temperature).
They demagnetise by absorbing magnetic flux quanta $\Phi_0=h/e$, decouple from
the magnetic field, transport the attached magnetic flux into the non-magnetic
centre of the current layer, where they release the flux in the form of
micro-scale magnetic vortices, becoming ordinary electrons. The newly born
micro-scale magnetic vortices reconnect in their strictly anti-parallel
sections when contacting other vortices, ultimately producing the meso-scale
reconnection structure. We clarify the notions of magnetic field lines and
field line radius, estimate the power released when two oppositely directed
flux quanta annihilate, and calculate the number density and Landau-level
filling-factor of `composite electrons' in the Hall domain. As side product we
find that the magnetic diffusion coefficient in plasma also appears in quanta

proposed based on the effective medium theory. This cloak is characterised by a
low reflection and good efficiency over a large bandwidth for both near and far

parameters on its inner surface. This singularity depends upon the sharpness of
corners, if the cloak has an irregular boundary, e.g. a polyhedron cloak

between particles, one of them ingoing and the other one being initially

orbital motion of the Earth spanning from 0 to -250 Myr. The main improvement
with respect to the previous numerical solution La2004 (Laskar et al. 2004) is
an improved adjustment of the parameters and initial conditions through a fit
over 1 Myr to a special version of the high accurate numerical ephemeris
INPOP08 (Fienga et al. 2009). The precession equations have also been entirely
revised and are no longer averaged over the orbital motion of the Earth and
Moon. This new orbital solution is now valid over more than 50 Myr in the past
or in the future with proper phases of the eccentricity variations. Due to
chaotic behavior, the precision of the solution decreases rapidly beyond this
time span, and we discuss the behavior of various solutions beyond 50 Myr. For
paleoclimate calibrations, we provide several different solutions that are all
compatible with the most precise planetary ephemeris. We have thus reached the
time where geological data are now required to discriminate among planetary
orbital solutions beyond 50 Myr.

that reaction $e^+ e^-\to J/\psi\pi^0$ is sensitive to the open charm

coupled QCD, whereby a confining gauge theory, quantized on the light front, is
mapped to a higher-dimensional anti de Sitter (AdS) space. The framework is
guided by the AdS/CFT correspondence incorporating a gravitational background
asymptotic to AdS space which encodes the salient properties of QCD, such as
the ultraviolet conformal limit at the AdS boundary at $z \to 0$, as well as
modifications of the geometry in the large $z$ infrared region to describe
confinement and linear Regge behavior. There are two equivalent procedures for
deriving the AdS/QCD equations of motion: one can start from the Hamiltonian
equation of motion in physical space time by studying the off-shell dynamics of
the bound state wavefunctions as a function of the invariant mass of the
constituents. To a first semiclassical approximation, where quantum loops and
quark masses are not included, this leads to a light-front Hamiltonian equation
which describes the bound state dynamics of light hadrons in terms of an
invariant impact variable $\zeta$ which measures the separation of the partons
within the hadron at equal light-front time. Alternatively, one can start from
the gravity side by studying the propagation of hadronic modes in a fixed
effective gravitational background. Both approaches are equivalent in the
semiclassical approximation. This allows us to identify the holographic
variable $z$ in AdS space with the impact variable $\zeta$. Light-front
holography thus allows a precise mapping of transition amplitudes from AdS to
physical space-time. The internal structure of hadrons is explicitly introduced
and the angular momentum of the constituents plays a key role.

of the environment. The decoherence rate under any control field can be
calculated if the spectrum of the coupling to the environment is known. We
present a direct measurement of the bath coupling spectrum in an ensemble of
optically trapped ultracold atoms, by applying a spectrally narrow-band control
field. The measured spectrum follows a Lorentzian shape at low frequencies, but
exhibits non-monotonic features at higher frequencies due to the oscillatory
motion of the atoms in the trap. These features agree with our analytical
models and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations of the collisional bath. From the
inferred bath-coupling spectrum, we predict the performance of well-known
dynamical decoupling sequences: CPMG, UDD and CDD. We then apply these
sequences in experiment and compare the results to predictions, finding good
agreement in the weak-coupling limit. Thus, our work establishes experimentally
the validity of the overlap integral formalism, and is an important step
towards the implementation of an optimal dynamical decoupling sequence for a
given measured bath spectrum.

future frontiers of low-energy neutrino physics and astrophysics. The neutron
coherence of neutral currents (NC) allows quite large cross sections in the
case of neutron rich targets, which can be exploited in detecting earth and sky
neutrinos by measuring nuclear recoils. A core-collapse supernova represents
one of the most powerful source of (anti)neutrinos in the Universe. These (NC)
cross sections are not dependent on flavor conversions and, thus, their
measurement will provide useful information about the neutrino source. In
particular the case of SN they will yield information about the primary
neutrino fluxes, i.e. before flavor conversions in neutrino sphere. The
advantages of large gaseous low threshold and high resolution time projection
counters (TPC) detectors TPC detectors will be discussed. These are especially
promising since they are expected to be relatively cheap and easy to maintain.
The information thus obtained can also be useful to other flavor sensitive
detectors, e.g. the large liquid scintillation detectors like LENA. All
together such detectors will provide invaluable information on the astrophysics
of core-collapse explosion and on the neutrino mixing parameters. In
particular, neutrino flavor transitions in SN envelope might be sensitive to
the value of theta-{13} and to the unknown neutrino mass hierarchy. Till a real
SN explosion is detected, one can use available earth neutrino sources with
similar energy spectra to test the behavior of these detectors. Among them, the
ORNL Neutron Spallation source (SNS) and boosted radioactive neutrino beams are
good candidates.

from photometric surveys through a large-scale enhancement of the galaxy
clustering amplitude. In photometric surveys, the distribution of observed
galaxies at high redshifts suffers from the gravitational-lensing
magnification, which systematically alters the number density for
magnitude-limited galaxy samples. We estimate size of the systematic bias in
the best-fit cosmological parameters caused by the magnification effect,
particularly focusing on the primordial non-Gaussianity. For upcoming deep
and/or wide photometric surveys like HSC, DES and LSST, the best-fit value of
the non-Gaussian parameter, fNL, obtained from the galaxy count data is highly
biased, and the true values of fNL would typically go outside the 3-sigma error
of the biased confidence region, if we ignore the magnification effect in the
theoretical template of angular power spectrum. The additional information from
cosmic shear data helps not only to improve the constraint, but also to reduce
the systematic bias. As a result, the size of systematic bias on fNL would
become small enough compared to the expected 1-sigma error for HSC and DES, but
it would be still serious for deep surveys with z_m > 1.5, like LSST.
Tomographic technique improves the constraint on fNL by a factor of 2-3
compared to the one without tomography, but the systematic bias would increase.

supergiant $\eta$ Carin\ae\ and located in the Carina star-forming complex. In
the context of the Chandra Carina Complex Project, we study Trumpler 16 using
new and archival X-ray data. A revised X-ray source list of the Trumpler 16
region contains 1232 X-ray sources including 1187 likely Carina members. These
are matched to 1047 near-infrared counterparts detected by the HAWK-I
instrument at the VLT allowing for better selection of cluster members. The
cluster is irregular in shape. Although it is roughly circular, there is a high
degree of sub-clustering, no noticeable central concentration and an extension
to the southeast. The high--mass stars show neither evidence of mass
segregation nor evidence of strong differential extinction. The derived
power-law slope of the X-ray luminosity function for Trumpler 16 reveals a much
steeper function than the Orion Nebula Cluster implying different ratio of
solar- to higher-mass stars. We estimate the total Trumpler 16 pre-main
sequence population to be > 6500 Class II and Class III X-ray sources. An
overall K-excess disk frequency of ~ 8.9% is derived using the X-ray selected
sample, although there is some variation among the sub-clusters, especially in
the Southeastern extension. X-ray emission is detected from 29 high--mass stars
with spectral types between B2 and O3.

  Finland",,,,"gr-qc cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the relationship between computation and spacetime structure,
focussing on the role of closed timelike curves (CTCs) in promoting
computational speedup. We note first that CTC traversal can be interpreted in
two distinct ways, depending on ones understanding of spacetime. Focussing on
one interpretation leads us to develop a toy universe in which no CTC can be
traversed more than once, whence no computational speedup is possible.
Focussing on the second (and more standard) interpretation leads to the
surprising conclusion that CTCs act as perfect information repositories: just
as black holes have entropy, so do CTCs. If we also assume that P is not equal
to NP, we find that all observers agree that, even if unbounded time travel
existed in their youth, this capability eventually vanishes as they grow older.
Thus the computational assumption ""P is not NP"" is also an assumption
concerning cosmological structure.

magnetic anisotropy (such as a magnetic molecule, magnetic adatom or quantum
dot coupled to a localized magnetic moment) are analyzed theoretically. In
particular, the influence of spin-polarized transport through a local orbital
of the system and exchange coupling of conduction electrons to the system's
magnetic core on the Kondo effect is discussed. The numerical renormalization
group method is applied to calculate the spectral functions and linear
conductance in the case of the parallel and antiparallel configurations of the
electrodes' magnetic moments. It is shown that both the magnetic anisotropy as
well as the exchange coupling between electrons tunneling through the
conducting orbital and magnetic core play an important role in formation of the
Kondo resonance, leading generally to its suppression. Specific transport
properties of such a system appear also as a nontrivial behavior of tunnel
magnetoresistance. It is also shown that the Kondo effect can be restored by an
external magnetic field in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetic
configurations.

transversely across each other in the so called van der Meer scan. We prove
that the method can be applied in the general case of arbitrary beam directions
and a separation scan plane. A simple method to develop an image of the beam in
its transverse plane from spatial distributions of interaction vertexes is also
proposed. From the beam images one can determine their overlap and the absolute
luminosity. This provides an alternative way of the luminosity measurement
during van der Meer scan.

an eigenspace of the free Hamiltonian to another is to use a periodic control
law with an angular frequency equal to the difference of the eigenvalues. For
finite dimensional quantum systems, the classical theory of averaging provides
a rigorous explanation of this experimentally validated result. This paper
extends this finite dimensional result, known as the Rotating Wave
Approximation, to infinite dimensional systems and provides explicit
convergence estimates.

function of the multiverse and a 3D Euclidean theory on the future boundary of
spacetime. In particular, we discuss the choice of the boundary metric and the
relation between the UV cutoff scale xi on the boundary and the hypersurfaces
Sigma on which the wave function is defined in the bulk. We propose that in the
limit of xi going to 0 these hypersurfaces should be used as cutoff surfaces in
the multiverse measure. Furthermore, we argue that in the inflating regions of
spacetime with a slowly varying Hubble rate H the hypersurfaces Sigma are
surfaces of constant comoving apparent horizon (CAH). Finally, we introduce a
measure prescription (called CAH+) which appears to have no pathological
features and coincides with the constant CAH cutoff in regions of slowly
varying H.
