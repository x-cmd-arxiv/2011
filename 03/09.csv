arrays (e.g., HESS or VERITAS and CTA) have the potential to set stringent
indirect bounds on the nine Lorentz-violating parameters of nonbirefringent
modified Maxwell theory minimally coupled to standard Dirac theory.
Theoretically, the most interesting case is isotropic Lorentz violation, which
is described by a single parameter [taken to vanish for the standard
Lorentz-invariant theory]. It appears possible to obtain in the future an upper
(lower) indirect bound on this single isotropic Lorentz-violating parameter at
the +10^{-21} (-10^{-17}) level. Comparison is made with existing and future
direct bounds from laboratory experiments. The possible physics implications of
upper bounds at the 10^{-21} level are discussed.

The full set of equations, suitable for numerical calculations is developed.
The explicit expressions for the polarization profile across the walls are
derived for several limiting cases and wall-widths are estimated. It is shown
analytically that different regimes of screening and different dependences for
width of charged domain walls on the temperature and parameters of the system
are possible, depending on spontaneous polarization and concentration of
carriers in the material. It is shown that the half-width of charged domain
walls in typical perovskites is about the nonlinear Thomas-Fermi
screening-length and about one order of magnitude larger than the half-width of
neutral domain-walls. The formation energies of ""head-to-head"" walls under
different regimes of screening are obtained, neglecting the poling ability of
the surface. It is shown that either ""head-to-head"" or ""tail-to-tail""
configuration can be energetically favorable in comparison with the monodomain
state of the ferroelectric if the poling ability of the surface is large
enough. If this is not the case, the existence of charged domain walls in bulk
ferroelectrics is merely a result of the domain-growth kinetics. Size-effect
corresponding to the competition between state with charged domain wall, single
domain state, multidomain state, and the state with the zero polarization is
considered. The results obtained for the case of an isolated ferroelectric
sample were compared with the results for an electroded sample. It was shown
that charged domain wall in electroded sample can be either metastable or
stable, depends on the work function difference between electrodes and
ferroelectric and the poling ability of the electrode/ferroelectric interface.

According to single crystal X-ray analysis, one dimensional CuO2 chains built
up from planar, edge-sharing CuO4 squares are a dominant feature of the crystal
structure. From the analysis of the Cu-O bond lengths we find that the system
forms a Wigner lattice. The commensurate charge order allows to explicitly
assign the valence states of either +2 or +3 to each copper atom resulting in a
repetition according to Cu(2+)-Cu(3+)-Cu(2+)-Cu(2+)-Cu(3+)-Cu(2+). Following
the theoretical analysis of the previously synthesized compounds Na3Cu2O4 and
Na8Cu5O10, the magnetic susceptibility was expected to show a large dimer gap.
Surprisingly, this is not the case. To resolve this puzzle, we show that the
magnetic couplings in this compound are strongly affected by excitations across
the Wigner charge gap. By including these contributions, which are distinct
from conventional superexchange in Mott-insulators, we obtain a quantitative

probability densities of non-relativistic quantum mechanics emerge naturally
from the particle dynamics of de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory. The time
evolution of a particle distribution initially not equal to the absolute square
of the wave function is calculated for a particle in a two-dimensional infinite
potential square well. Under the de Broglie-Bohm ontology, the box contains an
objectively-existing 'pilot wave' which guides the electron trajectory, and
this is represented mathematically by a Schroedinger wave function composed of
a finite out-of-phase superposition of M energy eigenstates (with M ranging
from 4 to 64). The electron density distributions are found to evolve naturally
into the Born-rule ones and stay there; in analogy with the classical case this
represents a decay to 'quantum equilibrium'. The proximity to equilibrium is
characterized by the coarse-grained subquantum H-function which is found to
decrease roughly exponentially towards zero over the course of time. The
timescale tau for this relaxation is calculated for various values of M and the
coarse-graining length epsilon. Its dependence on M is found to disagree with
an earlier theoretical prediction. A power law - tau inversely proportional to
M - is found to be fairly robust for all coarse-graining lengths and, although
a weak dependence of tau on epsilon is observed, it does not appear to follow
any straightforward scaling. A theoretical analysis is presented to explain
these results. This improvement in our understanding of timescales for
relaxation to quantum equilibrium is likely to be of use in the development of
models of relaxation in the early universe, with a view to constraining

subtraction of an anomaly pole, stressing on some of its properties in
superspace. In a local formulation these subtractions can be described in terms
of a physical scalar, an axion and related ghosts. They appear to be necessary
for the unitarization of the theory in the ultraviolet, but they may generate
an infrared instability of the corresponding effective action, signalled by
ghost condensation. In particular the subtraction of the superanomaly multiplet
by a pole in superspace is of dubious significance, due to the different nature
of the chiral and conformal anomalies. In turn, this may set more stringent
constraints on the coupling of supersymmetric theories to gravity.

The two functions have been extracted from data for single-spin asymmetries in
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and in single-inclusive hadron

of the extracted functions, we find that they show a ""sign mismatch"": while the
magnitude of the functions is roughly consistent, the $k_\perp$-moment of the
Sivers function has opposite sign from that of $T_{q,F}(x, x)$, both for up and
for down quarks. Barring any inconsistencies in our theoretical understanding
of the Sivers functions and their process dependence, the implication of this
mismatch is that either, the Sivers effect is not dominantly responsible for
the observed single-spin asymmetries in $pp$ collisions or, the current
semi-inclusive lepton scattering data do not sufficiently constrain the
$k_\perp$-moment of the quark Sivers functions. Both possibilities strengthen
the case for further experimental investigations of single-spin asymmetries in

laboratory to study close and wide binary systems, and to scrutinize their

oscillations. However, their origins are still uncertain, and increasing the

we aim at defining a strategy to find new, uncatalogued hot subdwarfs. Making
use of Virtual Observatory tools we thoroughly search stellar catalogues to
retrieve multi-colour photometry and astrometric information of a known sample
of blue objects, including hot subdwarfs, white dwarfs, cataclysmic variables
and main sequence OB stars. We define a procedure to discriminate among these
spectral classes, particularly designed to obtain a hot subdwarf sample with a
low contamination factor. In order to check the validity of the method, this
procedure is then applied to two test sky regions: the Kepler FoV and to a test
region of around (RA:225, DEC:5) deg. As a result, we obtained 38 hot subdwarf
candidates, 23 of which had already a spectral classification. We have acquired
spectroscopy for three other targets, and four additional ones have an
available SDSS spectrum, which we used to determine their spectral type. A
temperature estimate is provided for the candidates based on their spectral
energy distribution, considering two-atmospheres fit for objects with clear
infrared excess. Eventually, out of 30 candidates with spectral classification,
26 objects were confirmed to be hot subdwarfs, yielding a contamination factor
of only 13%. The high rate of success demonstrates the validity of the proposed
strategy to find new uncatalogued hot subdwarfs. An application of this method
to the entire sky will be presented in a forthcoming work.

new technique, which can simplify the analysis of the high spin asymptotics for
quantum group spinfoam vertex amplitude. This technique can generalize the
spinfoam asymptotic analysis developed by Barrett, et al to quantum group
spinfoam. As a preparation of asymptotic analysis, we define and analyze the
coherent states and coherent intertwiners for quantum group, which has certain
""factorization properties"". We show that in the high spin limit of quantum
group spinfoam, many q-deformed noncommutative ingredients become classical and
commutative. In particular, the squared norm of coherent intertwiner and the
(Euclidean) vertex amplitude become integrals on classical group, while there
are some additional terms (written in terms of classical group variables) make
quantum group corrections to the usual (classical group) coherent intertwiner
and vertex amplitude. These quantum group correction terms turn out to be
proportional to the deformation parameter, which hopefully gives the
cosmological term as its semiclassical limit.

the coefficients without this bias by including the sampling density making the

components to achieve adequate spectral fits, a softer component with kT =

these hot plasmas appear to be in a state of non-equilibrium ionization that
may indicate recent and current strong shocks. A cavity north of the embedded
giant HII region NGC 3576 is the only region studied here that exhibits hard
diffuse X-ray emission; this emission appears to be nonthermal and is likely
due to a recent cavity supernova, as evidenced by a previously-known pulsar and
newly-discovered pulsar wind nebula also seen in this cavity. All of these
targets exhibit X-ray emission lines that are not well-modeled by
variable-abundance thermal plasmas and that might be attributed to charge
exchange at the shock between the hot, tenuous, X-ray-emitting plasma and cold,
dense molecular material; this is likely evidence for dust destruction at the
many hot/cold interfaces that characterize massive star-forming regions.

in the 4.5{\mu}m region, where the BT Settl models are able to better predict
the flux through the IRAC filter, suggesting that non-equilibrium effects on
the CO-CO2 ratio are important for shaping the mid-infrared spectra of very
cool T dwarfs. We have also revisited the issue of dust opacity in the spectra

galaxies, follow well-defined scaling relations over many orders of magnitudes
in mass. These fundamental plane relations have been subject of several
studies, which have been mostly confined to certain types of galaxies and/or
star clusters so far. Here, we present a complete picture of hot stellar
systems ranging from faint galaxies and star clusters of only a few hundred
solar masses up to giant ellipticals (gEs) with 10^12 M_sun, in particular
including large samples of compact ellipticals (cEs), ultra-compact dwarf
galaxies (UCDs), dwarf ellipticals (dEs) of nearby galaxy clusters and Local
Group ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals (dSphs). For all those stellar systems we
show the effective radius-luminosity, effective radius-stellar mass, and
effective mass surface density-stellar mass plane. Two families of hot stellar
systems can be differentiated: the 'galaxian' family, ranging from gEs over Es
and dEs to dSphs, and the 'star cluster' family, comprising globular clusters
(GCs), UCDs and nuclear star clusters (NCs). Interestingly, massive ellipticals
have a similar size-mass relation as cEs, UCDs and NCs, with a clear common
boundary towards minimum sizes. No object of either family is located in the
'zone of avoidance' beyond this limit. Even the majority of early-type galaxies
at high redshift obeys this relation. The sizes of dEs and dSphs as well as GCs
barely vary with mass over several orders of magnitude. We use the constant
galaxy sizes to derive the distances of several local galaxy clusters. Both,
galaxies and star clusters, do not exceed a surface density of \Sigma_eff =
3.17*10^{10}*M^{-3/5} M_sun pc^{-2}, causing an orthogonal kink in the galaxy
sequence for ellipticals more massive than 10^{11} M_sun. The densest stellar
systems (within their effective radius) are nuclear star clusters. (abridged)

planetesimals. This early stage occurs much before the dispersal of most of the
gas from the protoplanetary disk. Due to their different aerodynamic
properties, planetesimals of different sizes and shapes experience different
drag forces from the gas during this time. Such differential forces produce a
wind-shearing (WISH) effect between close by, different size planetesimals. For
any two planetesimals, a WISH radius can be considered, at which the
differential acceleration due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual
gravitational pull between the planetesimals. We find that the WISH radius
could be much smaller than the Hill radius, i.e. WISH could play a more
important role than tidal perturbations by the star. Here we study the WISH
radii for planetesimal pairs of different sizes and compare the effects of wind
and gravitational shearing (drag force vs. gravitational tidal force). We then
discuss the role of WISH for the stability and survival of binary
planetesimals. Binaries are sheared apart by the wind if they are wider than
their WISH radius. WISH-stable binaries can inspiral and possibly coalesce due
to gas drag. Here, we calculate the WISH radius and the gas drag-induced merger
timescale, providing stability and survival criteria for gas-embedded binary
planetesimals. Our results suggest that even WISH-stable binaries may merge in
times shorter than the lifetime of the gaseous disk. This may constrain
currently observed binary planetesimals to have formed far from the star or at
a late stage after the dispersal of most of the disk gas. We note that the WISH
radius may also be important for other processes such as planetesimal erosion
and planetesimal encounters and collisions in a gaseous environment.

emission spectra, such as the GW approximation, rely on Many-Body Perturbation
Theory. They can be obtained by iterating a set of functional differential
equations relating the one-particle Green's function to its functional
derivative with respect to an external perturbing potential. In the present
work we apply a linear response expansion in order to obtain insights in
various approximations for Green's functions calculations. The expansion leads
to an effective screening, while keeping the effects of the interaction to all
orders. In order to study various aspects of the resulting equations we
discretize them, and retain only one point in space, spin, and time for all
variables. Within this one-point model we obtain an explicit solution for the
Green's function, which allows us to explore the structure of the general
family of solutions, and to determine the specific solution that corresponds to
the physical one. Moreover we analyze the performances of established
approaches like $GW$ over the whole range of interaction strength, and we
explore alternative approximations. Finally we link certain approximations for
the exact solution to the corresponding manipulations for the differential
equation which produce them. This link is crucial in view of a generalization
of our findings to the real (multidimensional functional) case where only the
differential equation is known.

longitudinal gravitino via supercurrent couplings. In this paper, we show that
LOSP decays can be substantially modified when there are multiple sectors that

100% branching fraction to a higgs boson and an uneaten goldstino, even if the
LOSP has negligible higgsino fraction. This occurs because the uneaten
goldstino is unconstrained by the supercurrent, allowing additional operators
to mediate LOSP decay. These operators can be enhanced in the presence of an R

after they become part of a cluster is essential for understanding the
evolution of these satellite galaxies. Aims: We investigate the potential of
galaxy-galaxy lensing to map the halo density profiles of galaxies in clusters.
Methods: We propose a method that separates the weak-lensing signal of the
dark-matter halos of galaxies in clusters from the weak-lensing signal of the
cluster's main halo. Using toy cluster models as well as ray-tracing through
N-body simulations of structure formation along with semi-analytic galaxy
formation models, we test the method and assess its performance. Results: We
show that with the proposed method, one can recover the density profiles of the
cluster galaxy halos in the range 30 - 300 kpc. Using the method, we find that
weak-lensing signal of cluster member galaxies in the Millennium Simulation is
well described by an Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. In contrast,
non-singular isothermal mass distribution (like PIEMD) model provide a poor
fit. Furthermore, we do not find evidence for a sharp truncation of the galaxy
halos in the range probed by our method. Instead, there is an observed overall
decrease of the halo mass profile of cluster member galaxies with increasing
time spent in the cluster. This trend, as well as the presence or absence of a
truncation radius, should be detectable in future weak-lensing surveys like the
Dark Energy Survey (DES) or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) survey.
Such surveys should also allow one to infer the mass-luminosity relation of
cluster galaxies with our method over two decades in mass. Conclusions: It is
possible to recover in a non-parametric way the mass profile of satellite
galaxies and their dark matter halos in future surveys, using our proposed weak
lensing method.

prevent baryon number symmetry from breaking spontaneously at finite density,

low-mass X-ray binaries that undergo accretion episodes of years to decades, it

properties: mass, concentration, spin, shape, overdensity, and the angle
($\Phi_L$) between the major axis and the angular momentum vector. Two
additional parameters ($\x_{off}$ and $\rho_{rms}$) are used to describe the

hand, and halo relaxedness on the other. Nonetheless, three principle
components are usually required to account for most of the variance. We argue
that halo mass is not as dominant as expected, which is a challenge for halo
occupation models and semi-analytic models that assume that mass determines
other halo (and galaxy) properties. In addition, we find that the angle
$\Phi_L$ is not significantly correlated with other halo parameters, which may
present a difficulty for models in which galaxy disks are oriented in haloes in
a particular way. Finally, at fixed mass, we find that a halo's environment
(quantified by the large-scale overdensity) is relatively unimportant.

atomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10L* galaxies. In this paper, we present CO
luminosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. The
overall CO detection rate is 54%, but our survey also uncovers the existence of
sharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surface
density and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurable
cold gas component but above which the detection rate of the CO line drops
suddenly. The mean molecular gas fraction MH2/M* of the CO detections is
0.066+/-0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is a
strong function of NUV-r colour. Through stacking, we set a firm upper limit of
MH2/M*=0.0016+/-0.0005 for red galaxies with NUV-r>5.0. The average
molecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, with
significant scatter from one galaxy to the next. The existence of strong
detection thresholds in both the HI and CO lines suggests that ""quenching""
processes have occurred in these systems. Intriguingly, atomic gas strongly
dominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie above
these thresholds. This suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still be

entire sample of galaxies where black hole mass, velocity dispersion, sigma,
and asymptotic circular velocity, Vc, have all been measured. We fit M-sigma
and M-Vc to a power law, and find that in both relationships the scatter and
slope are similar. This model-independent analysis suggests that although the
black hole masses are not uniquely determined by dark matter halo mass, when
considered for the current sample as a whole, the M-Vc correlation may be as
strong (or as weak) as M-sigma. Although the data are sparse, there appears to
be more scatter in the correlation for both sigma and Vc at the low--mass end.
This is not unexpected given our current understanding of galaxy and black hole
assembly. In fact, there are several compelling reasons that account for this:
(i) SMBH formation is likely less efficient in low-mass galaxies with large
angular momentum content; (ii) SMBH growth is less efficient in low-mass disk
galaxies that have not experienced major mergers; (iii) dynamical effects, such
as gravitational recoil, increase scatter preferentially at the low-mass end.
Therefore, the recent observational claim of the absence of central SMBHs in
bulgeless, low mass galaxies, or deviations from the correlations defined by
high-mass black holes in large galaxies today is, in fact, predicated by
current models of black hole growth. We show how this arises as a direct
consequence of the coupling between dark matter halos and central black holes

Essentially we find that there are two important features of edge states: (a)
umklapp processes are completely forbidden for edge states; this allows a
spin-polarized ground state. (b) the strong momentum dependence of the

ionized by the massive star HD206267 (O6.5V). We discover a spatio-temporal
gradient of increasing accretion rates, increasing Spitzer infrared excess, and
younger ages away from the ionizing star, providing a strong indication that
the formation of these clusters has been sequentially triggered by HD206267
during the last ~1 Myr.

electroweak doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value and gives mass to
Standard Model fermions. As well as the novel accommodation of a Standard Model
Higgs within a supersymmetric framework, this leads to a very predictive model,
with some advantages over the MSSM. In particular, problems with proton decay,
flavour changing neutral currents and large CP violation are ameliorated,
primarily due to the presence of an anomaly-free R-symmetry. Since
supersymmetry must be broken at a low scale, gravity-mediated effects which
break the R-symmetry are naturally small. The R-symmetry requires the presence
of adjoint chiral superfields, to give Dirac masses to the gauginos; these
adjoints are the only non-MSSM fields in the visible sector. The LSP is a very
light neutralino, which is mostly bino. Such a light neutralino is not in
conflict with experiment, and is a striking prediction of the minimal model.
Additional scenarios to raise the mass of this neutralino to the weak scale are
also outlined. Prospects for discovery at the LHC are briefly discussed, along
with viable scenarios for achieving gauge-coupling unification.

pions ($\pi^\pm$) from both proton and deuteron targets was measured. The data
are in the deep-inelastic scattering region with invariant mass squared $W^2$ >
4 GeV$^2$ and range in four-momentum transfer squared $2 < Q^2 < 4$
(GeV/c)$^2$, and cover a range in the Bjorken scaling variable 0.2 < x < 0.6.
The fractional energy of the pions spans a range 0.3 < z < 1, with small
transverse momenta with respect to the virtual-photon direction, $P_t^2 < 0.2$
(GeV/c)$^2$. The invariant mass that goes undetected, $M_x$ or W', is in the
nucleon resonance region, W' < 2 GeV. The new data conclusively show the onset
of quark-hadron duality in this process, and the relation of this phenomenon to
the high-energy factorization ansatz of electron-quark scattering and
subsequent quark --> pion production mechanisms. The x, z and $P_t^2$
dependences of several ratios (the ratios of favored-unfavored fragmentation
functions, charged pion ratios, deuteron-hydrogen and aluminum-deuteron ratios
for $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$) have been studied. The ratios are found to be in good
agreement with expectations based upon a high-energy quark-parton model
description. We find the azimuthal dependences to be small, as compared to
exclusive pion electroproduction, and consistent with theoretical expectations
based on tree-level factorization in terms of transverse-momentum-dependent
parton distribution and fragmentation functions. In the context of a simple
model, the initial transverse momenta of $d$ quarks are found to be slightly
smaller than for $u$ quarks, while the transverse momentum width of the favored
fragmentation function is about the same as for the unfavored one, and both
fragmentation widths are larger than the quark widths.

involve long-range interactions that are not evident from local predator-prey

stellar interior. The existence of lithium-rich giants still represents a
challenge for stellar evolution models. Aims: We have collected a large
database of high-resolution stellar spectra of 824 candidate thick-disk giants
having 2\,MASS photometry and proper motions measured by the Southern
Proper-Motion Program (SPM). In order to investigate the nature of Li-rich
giants, we searched this database for giants presenting a strong Li\,I
resonance line. Methods: We performed a chemical abundance analysis on the
selected stars with the MOOG code along with proper ATLAS-9 model atmospheres.
The iron content and atmospheric parameters were fixed by using the equivalent
width of a sample of Fe lines. We also derive abundances for C, N, and O and
measure or derive lower limits on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios, which
is a sensible diagnostic of the stars evolutionary status. Results: We detected
five stars with a lithium abundance higher than 1.5, i.e. Li-rich according to
the current definition. One of them (SPM-313132) has A(Li)$>$3.3 and, because
of this, belongs to the group of the rare super Li-rich giants. Its kinematics
makes it a likely thin-disk member and its atmospheric parameters are
compatible with it being a 4\,M$_\odot$ star either on the red giant branch
(RGB) or the early asymptotic giant branch. This object is the first super
Li-rich giant detected at this phase. The other four are likely low-mass
thick-disk stars evolved past the RGB luminosity bump, as determined from their
metallicities and atmospheric parameters. The most evolved of them lies close
to the RGB-tip. It has A(Li)$>$2.7 and a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio,
close to the cool bottom processing predictions.

multiperiodic long-period pulsators of the V1093 Her type, with the number of
periodicities ranging from 8 (KIC8302197) to 53 (KIC11558725). The frequencies
and amplitudes are typical of g-mode pulsators of this type. We do not find any
evidence for binarity in the five stars from their observed pulsation
frequencies. As these are g-mode pulsators, we briefly looked for period
spacings for mode identification, and found average spacings about 260s and
145s. This may indicate l=1 and 2 patterns. Some modes may show evidence of

indicate that metal abundances throughout most of the remnant's rim are
depleted to about 0.2 times the solar value. However, recent X-ray studies have
revealed in some narrow regions along the outermost rim anomalously ""enhanced""
abundances (up to about 1 solar). The reason for these anomalous abundances is
not understood. Here, we examine X-ray spectra in annular sectors covering
nearly the entire rim of the Cygnus Loop using Suzaku (21 pointings) and
XMM-Newton (1 pointing). We find that spectra in the ""enhanced"" abundance
regions commonly show a strong emission feature at about 0.7 keV. This feature
is likely a complex of He-like O K(gamma + delta + epsilon), although other
possibilities cannot be fully excluded. The intensity of this emission relative
to He-like O Kalpha appears to be too high to be explained as thermal emission.
This fact, as well as the spatial concentration of the anomalous abundances in
the outermost rim, leads us to propose an origin from charge-exchange processes
between neutrals and H-like O. We show that the presence of charge-exchange
emission could lead to the inference of apparently ""enhanced"" metal abundances
using pure thermal emission models. Accounting for charge-exchange emission,
the actual abundances could be uniformly low throughout the rim. The overall
abundance depletion remains an open question.

features are not uncommon in the spectra of SNe Ia before maximum light, the
presence of strong carbon absorption has been reported only in a minority of
objects, typically during the pre-maximum phase. The reported low frequency of
carbon detections may be due to low signal-to-noise data, low abundance of
unburned material, line blending between C II 6580 and Si II 6355, ejecta
temperature differences, asymmetrical distribution effects, or a combination of
these. However, a survey of published pre-maximum spectra reveals that more SNe
Ia than previously thought may exhibit C II 6580 absorption features and relics
of line blending near 6300 Angstroms. Here we present new SN Ia observations

drive galaxy evolution, so a considerable framework of semi-analytic models and
N-body simulations has been constructed to calculate how mergers transform a
growing galaxy. However, galaxy mergers are only one type of major dynamical
interaction between halos -- another class of encounter, a close flyby, has
been largely ignored. We use cosmological N-body simulations to reconstruct the
entire dynamical interaction history of dark matter halos. We present a careful
method of identifying and tracking a dark matter halo which resolves the
typical classes of anomalies that occur in N-body data. This technique allows
us to robustly follow halos and several hierarchical levels of subhalos as they
grow, dissolve, merge, and flyby one another -- thereby constructing both a
census of the dynamical interactions in a volume and an archive of the
dynamical evolution of an individual halo. In addition to a census of mergers,
our tool characterizes the frequency of close flyby interactions in the
Universe. We find that the number of close flyby interactions is comparable to,
or even surpasses, the number of mergers for halo masses $\gtrsim
10^{11}\,\Msun$ at $z \lesssim 2$. Halo flybys occur so frequently to high mass
halos that they are continually perturbed, unable to reach a dynamical
equilibrium. In particular, we find that Milky Way type halos undergo a similar
number of flybys as mergers irrespective of mass-ratio for $z\lesssim 2$. We
also find tentative evidence that at high redshift, $z \gtrsim 14$, flybys are
as frequent as mergers. Our results suggest that close halo flybys can play an
important role in the evolution of the earliest dark matter halos and their
galaxies, and can still influence galaxy evolution at the present epoch.

$7.9\pm0.2 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. If the dust lies in an equatorial

$\gamma$-ray flux from 4C 21.35 as long as the scattering occurs within a few
parsecs of the central engine. We also report a tentative detection of dust in
the quasar CTA102, in which the luminosity of the infrared excess is $7 \pm 2

noisy to detect the $10 \mu$m silicate feature. Upper limits to the luminosity

of IR photons to $\gamma$-ray energies in these two sources. The estimated
covering factor of the hot dust in 4C 21.35, 22%, is similar to that of

be the rotation period of the star. From the magnetic field curve, and assuming
a simple dipolar field geometry, we derive a polar field strength of
approximately 7 kG and a lower limit of 52 degrees for the inclination of the
rotation axis. However, based on the behaviour of the H-alpha emission we adopt
a large inclination angle of 85 degrees and this leads to a large magnetic
obliquity of 77 degrees. The H-alpha emission arises from two distinct regions
located at the intersections of the magnetic and rotation equators and which
corotate with the star at a distance of about 3.5 R* above its surface. We

addition to the compact cores identified in the earlier measurements. One
object appears to have a small companion that may be involved in an ongoing
minor merger of the sort that could be responsible for building up the outer
parts of these galaxies. The ages of the dominant stellar populations in these
objects are found to be around 2--4 Gyr, in good agreement with the previous
estimates. The presence of diffuse outer structures in these galaxies indicates
that truly compact and massive red galaxies are exceedingly rare at low
redshift. The relatively young stellar populations suggest that the accretion
of the extensive outer material must occur essentially universally on
relatively short timescales of few billion years or less. These results confirm
and extend previous suggestions that the driving mechanism behind the size
evolution of high redshift compact galaxies cannot be highly stochastic
processes such as major mergers, which would inevitably leave a non-negligible
fraction of survivors at low redshift.

background. When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers,
radioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order
to control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique
that uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur
close to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The
composite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy
absorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers
that act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the
analysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields. In this
paper, we describe a full thermal model and experimental results for three
prototype detectors. The detectors consist of Ge, Si, or TeO2 thin absorbers as
active shields, all with TeO2 crystals as main absorbers. In all cases, the
surface event rejection capability is clearly demonstrated. In addition,
simulations and preliminary results show that it is possible to detect energy
depositions that occurred on the shields without separate readout channels for
them. The energy depositions in the shields are distinguished from those in the
main absorber through pulse shape discrimination. This simplification makes
this technique a viable method for the rejection of surface energy depositions
in next-generation bolometric double beta decay searches, such as possible
extensions or upgrades of the CUORE experiment.

the photosphere as a cellular network of around 35 Mm across, with a turnover
lifetime of 1-2 days. It is strongly linked to the structure of the magnetic
field. The horizontal, divergent flows within supergranule cells carry local
field lines to the cell boundaries, while the rotational properties of
supergranule upflows may contribute to the restoration of the poloidal field as
part of the dynamo mechanism that controls the solar cycle. The solar minimum
at the transition from cycle 23 to 24 was notable for its low level of activity
and its extended length. It is of interest to study whether the convective
phenomena that influences the solar magnetic field during this time differed in
character to periods of previous minima. This study investigates three
characteristics (velocity components, sizes and lifetimes) of solar
supergranulation. Comparisons of these characteristics are made between the
minima of cycles 22/23 and 23/24 using MDI Doppler data from 1996 and 2008,

models in the 19-dimensional parameter space of the pMSSM. These models have
been found to satisfy existing experimental and theoretical constraints and
provide insight into general features of the MSSM without reference to a
particular SUSY breaking scenario or any other assumptions at the GUT scale.
Using backgrounds generated by ATLAS, we find that imprecise knowledge of these
estimated backgrounds is a limiting factor in the potential discovery of these
models and that some channels become systematics-limited at larger
luminosities. As this systematic error is varied between 20-100%, roughly half
to 90% of this model sample is observable with significance S>5 for 1 fb^{-1}
of integrated luminosity. We then examine the model characteristics for the
cases which cannot be discovered and find several contributing factors. We find
that a blanket statement that squarks and gluinos are excluded with masses
below a specific value cannot be made. We next explore possible modifications
to the kinematic cuts in these analyses that may improve the pMSSM model
coverage. Lastly, we examine the implications of a null search at the 7 TeV LHC

nebula NGC 7009, with a wavelength coverage from 3040 to 11000 A. Traditional
emission line identification is carried out to identify all the emission
features in the spectra, based on the available laboratory atomic transition
data. Since the spectra are of medium resolution, we use multi-Gaussian line
profile fitting to deblend faint blended lines, most of which are optical
recombination lines (ORLs) emitted by singly ionized ions of abundant
second-row elements such as C, N, O and Ne. Computer-aided emission-line
identification, using the code EMILI developed by Sharpee et al., is then
employed to further identify all the emission lines thus obtained. In total
about 1200 emission features are identified, with the faintest ones down to
fluxes 10^{-4} of H_beta. The flux errors for all emission lines, estimated
from multi-Gaussian fitting, are presented. Plots of the whole optical
spectrum, identified emission lines labeled, are presented along with the
results of multi-Gaussian fits. Plasma diagnostics using optical forbidden line
ratios are carried out. Also derived are electron temperatures and densities
from the H I, He I and He II recombination spectrum.

for the distance between belief states that relies on aggregating underlying
state distance measures. We give several techniques to aggregate state
distances and their associated properties. Many existing heuristics exhibit a
subset of the properties, but in order to provide a standardized comparison we
present several generalizations of planning graph heuristics that are used in a
single planner. We compliment our belief state distance estimate framework by
also investigating efficient planning graph data structures that incorporate
BDDs to compute the most effective heuristics.
  We developed two planners to serve as test-beds for our investigation. The
first, CAltAlt, is a conformant regression planner that uses A* search. The
second, POND, is a conditional progression planner that uses AO* search. We
show the relative effectiveness of our heuristic techniques within these

clumps with sizes of \sim 1 pc in the region. Two of them have peculiar red
shifted velocity components at their edges, which can be interpreted as the
results of the interaction between the cloud and the Cepheus Bubble. From the

radius, velocity width in FWHM, and LTE mass of 0.36\pm0.07 pc, 0.37\pm0.09 km
s-1, and 41\pm29 Msun, respectively. All the cores in S140 are most likely to
be gravitationally bound by considering the uncertainty in the C18O abundance.
We derived a C18O core mass function (CMF), which shows a power-law-like
behavior above a turnover at 30 Msun. The best-fit power-law index of
-2.1\pm0.2 is quite consistent with those of the IMF and the C18O CMF in the
OMC-1 region by Ikeda & Kitamura (2009). Kramer et al. (1998) estimated the
power-law index of -1.65 in S140 from the C18O(J=2-1) data, which is
inconsistent with this study. However, the C18O(J=2-1) data are spatially
limited to the central part of the cloud and are likely to be biased toward
high-mass cores, leading to the flatter CMF. Consequently, this study and our
previous one strongly support that the power-law form of the IMF has been
already determined at the density of \sim 10^{3-4} cm^{-3}, traced by the
C18O(J=1-0) line.

i.e., in the presence of a nonvanishing superconducting energy gap $\Delta$

argued that the strange high field and low temperature (HFLT) superconducting
phase of CeCoIn_5 is a coexisting phase of the FFLO and incommensurate AFM
orders, and that this PPB mechanism of an AFM ordering is also the origin of
the AFM quantum critical fluctuation which has occurred close to H_{c2}(0) in

shown to be consistent with an inverse-squared radial potential with a lower

The (WKB) mean-squared radii of the Efimov states scale geometrically like the
inverse of their energies. The WKB wavefunctions, regularized near the

practically indistinguishable from the exact wave functions even for the lowest

voltages Vout = f\cdot(h/e). It is based on an integrated quantized circuit of
a single electron pump operated at pumping frequency f and a quantum Hall
device monolithically integrated in series. The output voltages of several \muV
are expected to be scalable by orders of magnitude using present technology.
The device might open a new route towards the closure of the quantum
metrological triangle. Furthermore it represents a universal electrical quantum
reference allowing to generate quantized values of the three most relevant
electrical units of voltage, current, and resistance based on fundamental
constants using a single device.

structure and evolution of the object in the decline from the 2002 eruption. We
obtained spectroscopic observations of V838 Mon in January--March 2009 with
UVES/VLT. The results are analysed and compared with similar observations
obtained in October 2005 with HIRES/Keck. The most striking difference between
2009 and 2005 is a complete absence of the B3V component and of the [FeII]
emission lines in 2009. The present spectrum displays only the spectrum of the
2002 eruption remnant. It resembles that of an M6 giant, although the molecular
bands in V838 Mon are deeper than those in standard stellar spectra of a
similar spectral class. Several atomic lines, which displayed P-Cyg profiles in
2005, are now dominated by pure absorptions. Some of these lines, however, show
a narrow emission component, which, as we argue, measures the radial velocity
of V838 Mon. The resulting heliocentric velocity is 71 km/s, which very well
agrees with the velocity obtained from SiO maser observations. The atomic lines
and the molecular bands show very complex kinematics. In some atomic lines and
high-excitation molecular bands we observe matter infalling in the object
atmosphere. The infall components were already observed in 2005, but were less
pronounced and present in fewer lines than in 2009. We argue that the most
negative radial velocity components seen in the resonance atomic lines and in
the low-excitation molecular bands were formed in the ejecta of the 2002
eruption. The B3V companion most probably became engulfed in an opaque dusty
matter of the 2002 V838 Mon ejecta.

The FUV and U band emission is enhanced in bright, filamentary structures
surrounding the BCG nuclei. These filaments can be traced out to 20 kpc from
the nuclei in the FUV. Excess FUV and U band light is determined by removing
emission due to the underlying old stellar population and mapped with 1 arcsec
spatial resolution over the central 20 kpc regions of both galaxies. We find
the FUV and U excess emission to be spatially coincident and a stellar
interpretation requires the existence of a significant amount of 10000-50000 K
stars. Correcting for nebular continuum emission and dust intrinsic to the BCG
further increases the FUV to U band emission ratio and implies that stars alone
may not suffice to explain the observations. However, lack of detailed
information on the gas and dust distribution and extinction law in these
systems prevents us from ruling out a purely stellar origin. Non-stellar
processes, such as the central AGN, Scattering, Synchrotron and Bremsstrahlung
emission are investigated and found to not be able to explain the FUV and U

of reasoning, we show that the mass ratio of the component losing mass to the

The parameter space of interest for covariance graph models is the cone $P_G$
of positive definite matrices with fixed zeros corresponding to the missing
edges of $G$. As in Letac and Massam [Ann. Statist. 35 (2007) 1278--1323], we
consider the case where $G$ is decomposable. In this paper, we construct on the

no curvature singularity and no horizons but have a conic geometry with a

approaches a constant as the coupling constant of dilaton field goes to

region and southern superwind outflow in detail with five pointings, and with
SparsePak we observed two partially overlapping regions covering the central
disk and northern halo. The high signal-to-noise of the data and spectral
resolution (80-90 km/s) enable us to accurately decompose the emission line
profiles into multiple components.
  The combination of these datasets, together with information available in the
literature, has allowed us to study the starburst-driven superwind in great
detail. We investigate the known minor axis outflow cone, which is well-defined
in the Halpha imaging and kinematics between r=280-660 pc from the nucleus.
Kinematic modelling indicates a wide opening angle (~60 deg), an inclination
consistent with the disk, and deprojected outflow speeds of a few 100 km/s that
increase with distance above the plane. The [NII]/Halpha and [SII]/Halpha line
ratio maps imply that a significant fraction of the wind optical emission lines
arise from shocked gas. From the kinematics, the cone appears partially closed
in at least one place, and very broad Halpha line widths (>400 km/s FWHM)
suggest there is material filling the cone in some regions. Extrapolation of
the cone to its apex shows it is not centred on the starburst nucleus,
suggesting the wind is deflected and collimated by the dense circumnuclear
material. We discuss the implications of these findings on our understanding of
the origins and evolution of the superwind. The lack of an obvious connection
between the inner (r<1 kpc) Halpha and X-ray bright outflow cone and the
large-scale (r<10 kpc) X-ray ""horns"" is also discussed.

method, abbreviated SPAM, which is a fairly recent iterative method to compute
a few eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix $A$. It falls in the category of
inner-outer iteration methods and aims to save on the costs of matrix-vector
products with $A$ within its inner iteration. This is done by choosing an
approximation $A_0$ of $A$, and then, based on both $A$ and $A_0$, to define a
sequence $(A_k)_{k=0}^n$ of matrices that increasingly better approximate $A$
as the process progresses. Then the matrix $A_k$ is used in the $k$th inner
iteration instead of $A$.
  In spite of its main idea being refreshingly new and interesting, SPAM has
not yet been studied in detail by the numerical linear algebra community. We
would like to change this by explaining the method, and to show that for
certain special choices for $A_0$, SPAM turns out to be mathematically
equivalent to known eigenvalue methods. More sophisticated approximations $A_0$
turn SPAM into a boosted version of Lanczos, whereas it can also be interpreted
as an attempt to enhance a certain instance of the preconditioned
Jacobi-Davidson method.
  Numerical experiments are performed that are specifically tailored to
illustrate certain aspects of SPAM and its variations. For experiments that
test the practical performance of SPAM in comparison with other methods, we
refer to other sources. The main conclusion is that SPAM provides a natural
transition between the Lanczos method and one-step preconditioned
Jacobi-Davidson.

radius approximately proportional to t^0.8, however, deviations from a strict

density estimates of the constituent distributions. We show that our estimate
is asymptotically equivalent to the empirical ROC curve if the underlying
densities are in fact log-concave. In addition, we empirically show that our
proposed estimator exhibits an efficiency gain for finite sample sizes with
respect to the standard empirical estimate in various scenarios and that it is
only slightly less efficient, if at all, compared to the fully parametric
binormal estimate in case the underlying distributions are normal. The
estimator is also quite robust against modest deviations from the log-concavity
assumption. We show that bootstrap confidence intervals for the value of the
ROC curve at a fixed false positive fraction based on the new estimate are on
average shorter compared to the approach by Zhou & Qin (2005), while
maintaining coverage probability. Computation of our proposed estimate uses the
R package logcondens that implements univariate log-concave density estimation
and can be done very efficiently using only one line of code. These obtained
results lead us to advocate our estimate for a wide range of scenarios.

that the dynamics of nanotube and graphene resonators is in fact highly exotic.
We propose an unprecedented scenario where mechanical dissipation is entirely
determined by nonlinear damping. As a striking consequence, the quality factor
Q strongly depends on the amplitude of the motion. This scenario is radically
different from that of other resonators, whose dissipation is dominated by a
linear damping term. We believe that the difference stems from the reduced

nonlinear nature of the damping to improve the figure of merit of
nanotube/graphene resonators.

disparate information sources to optimize their behavior in complex
environments. How this capability can be quantified and related to the
functional complexity of an organism remains a challenging problem, in
particular since organismal functional complexity is not well-defined. We
present here several candidate measures that quantify information and
integration, and study their dependence on fitness as an artificial agent
(""animat"") evolves over thousands of generations to solve a navigation task in
a simple, simulated environment. We compare the ability of these measures to
predict high fitness with more conventional information-theoretic processing
measures. As the animat adapts by increasing its ""fit"" to the world,
information integration and processing increase commensurately along the
evolutionary line of descent. We suggest that the correlation of fitness with
information integration and with processing measures implies that high fitness
requires both information processing as well as integration, but that
information integration may be a better measure when the task requires memory.
A correlation of measures of information integration (but also information
processing) and fitness strongly suggests that these measures reflect the
functional complexity of the animat, and that such measures can be used to
quantify functional complexity even in the absence of fitness data.

Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). Spectroscopically, it appears superficially
similar to the class of subluminous SN1991bg-like SNe, but it has several
unusual features which make it stand out from this population. Its peak
luminosity is fainter than any previously discovered SN1991bg-like SN Ia (M_B
-15.5), but without the unusually red optical colors expected if the faint
luminosity were due to extinction. The photospheric optical spectra have very
unusual strong lines of Sc II and Mg I, with possible Sr II, together with
stronger than average Ti II and low velocities of ~6000 km/s. The host galaxy
of PTF09dav is ambiguous. The SN lies either on the extreme outskirts (~41kpc)
of a spiral galaxy, or in an very faint (M_R>-12.8) dwarf galaxy, unlike other
1991bg-like SNe which are invariably associated with massive, old stellar
populations. PTF09dav is also an outlier on the light-curve-width--luminosity
and color--luminosity relations derived for other sub-luminous SNe Ia. The
inferred 56Ni mass is small (0.019+/-0.003Msun), as is the estimated ejecta
mass of 0.36Msun. Taken together, these properties make PTF09dav a remarkable
event. We discuss various physical models that could explain PTF09dav. Helium
shell detonation or deflagration on the surface of a CO white-dwarf can explain
some of the features of PTF09dav, including the presence of Sc and the low
photospheric velocities, but the observed Si and Mg are not predicted to be
very abundant in these models. We conclude that no single model is currently
capable of explaining all of the observed signatures of PTF09dav.

probability theory. They arise naturally in expert elicitation, for instance in
cases where bounds are specified on the quantiles of a random variable, or when
quantiles are specified only at a finite number of points. Many practical and
formal results concerning p-boxes already exist in the literature. In this
paper, we provide new efficient tools to construct multivariate p-boxes and
develop algorithms to draw inferences from them. For this purpose, we formalise
and extend the theory of p-boxes using Walley's behavioural theory of imprecise
probabilities, and heavily rely on its notion of natural extension and existing
results about independence modeling. In particular, we allow p-boxes to be
defined on arbitrary totally preordered spaces, hence thereby also admitting
multivariate p-boxes via probability bounds over any collection of nested sets.
We focus on the cases of independence (using the factorization property), and
of unknown dependence (using the Fr\'echet bounds), and we show that our
approach extends the probabilistic arithmetic of Williamson and Downs. Two
design problems---a damped oscillator, and a river dike---demonstrate the
practical feasibility of our results.

low as 550{\deg}C. The transport critical current density evaluated by the
current-voltage characteristics is over 700 A/cm2 at 4.2 K under zero field,
which is several times larger than FeTe0.5Se0.5 superconducting wires. The
critical current density estimated from magneto-optical images of flux
penetration is also similar to this value. The upper critical field of the
polycrystalline FeTe0.5Se0.5 at T = 0 K estimated by
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory is 585 kOe, which is comparable to that of
single crystals. This study gives some insight into how to improve the
performance of FeTe0.5Se0.5 superconducting wires.

because their scaling behaviour as a function of the lattice spacing is
predictable. Algorithms implementing the Langevin equation, for example, are
known to be renormalizable if the simulated theory is. In this paper we show
that the situation is different in the case of the molecular-dynamics evolution
on which the HMC algorithm is based. More precisely, studying the phi^4 theory,
we find that the hyperbolic character of the molecular-dynamics equations leads
to non-local (and thus non-removable) ultraviolet singularities already at
one-loop order of perturbation theory.

fluctuations in Fe1+xTe as a function of both temperature and interstitial iron
concentration. For Fe1.057(7)Te the magnetic structure is defined by a
commensurate wavevector of (1/2,0,1/2). The spin fluctuations are gapped with a
sharp onset at 7 meV and are three dimensional in momentum transfer, becoming
two dimensional at higher energy transfers. On doping with interstitial iron,
we find in Fe1.141(5)Te the ordering wavevector is located at the (0.38, 0,
1/2) position and the fluctuations are gapless with the intensity peaked at an
energy transfer of 4 meV. These results show that the spin fluctuations in the
Fe1+xTe system a can be tuned not only through selenium doping, but also with
interstitial iron. We also compare these results with superconducting
concentrations and in particular the resonance mode in the Fe_1+xTe_1-ySe_y
system.

theories where the quasiparticles are distributed uniformly in space, and the
equilibration involves only their velocity distribution. For such solutions,
the hydrodynamic variables remain constant. We construct asymptotically AdS
solutions of Einstein's gravity dual to such processes at strong coupling,
perturbatively in the amplitude expansion, where the expansion parameter is the
ratio of the amplitude of the non-hydrodynamic shear-stress tensor to the
pressure. At each order, we sum over all time derivatives through exact
recursion relations. We argue that the metric has a regular future horizon,
order by order in the amplitude expansion, provided the shear-stress tensor
follows an equation of motion. At the linear order, this equation of motion
implies that the metric perturbations are composed of zero wavelength
quasinormal modes. Our method allows us to calculate the non-linear corrections
to this equation perturbatively in the amplitude expansion. We thus derive a
special case of our previous conjecture on the regularity condition on the
boundary stress tensor that endows the bulk metric with a regular future
horizon, and also refine it further. We also propose a new outlook for
heavy-ion phenomenology at RHIC and ALICE.
