intermetallics are presented from first-principles calculations. The elastic
moduli are obtained from the coefficients of the polynomials from the nonlinear
least-squares fitting of the energy-strain functions. The calculated
second-order elastic constants of AlRE intermetallics are consistent with the
previous calculations. To judge that our computational accuracy is reasonable,
the calculated third-order constants of Al are compared with the available
experimental data and other theoretical results and found very good agreement.
In comparison with the theory of the linear elasticity, the third-order effects
are very important with the finite strains are lager than approximately 3.5%.
Finally, the pressure derivative has been discussed.

quantum dots are investigated systematically and the exciton spin relaxation in
GaN quantum dots is calculated by first setting up the effective exciton
Hamiltonian. The electron-hole exchange interaction Hamiltonian, which consists
of the long- and short-range parts, is derived within the effective-mass
approximation by taking into account the conduction, heavy- and light-hole
bands, and especially the split-off band. The scheme applied in this work
allows the description of excitons in both the strong and weak confinement
regimes. The importance of treating the direct electron-hole Coulomb
interaction unperturbatively is demonstrated. We show in our calculation that
the light-hole and split-off bands are negligible when considering the exciton
fine structure, even for GaN quantum dots, and the short-range exchange
interaction is irrelevant when considering the optically active doublet
splitting. We point out that the long-range exchange interaction, which is
neglected in many previous works, contributes to the energy splitting between
the bright and dark states, together with the short-range exchange interaction.
Strong dependence of the optically active doublet splitting on the anisotropy
of dot shape is reported. Large doublet splittings up to 600 $\mu$eV, and even
up to several meV for small dot size with large anisotropy, is shown in GaN
quantum dots. The spin relaxation between the lowest two optically active
exciton states in GaN quantum dots is calculated, showing a strong dependence
on the dot anisotropy. Long exciton spin relaxation time is reported in GaN
quantum dots. These findings are in good agreement with the experimental
results.

stars show a surprising diversity of pulsation behavior in the atmospheric
layers, pointing, in particular, to the co-existence of running and standing
waves. The correct interpretation of these data requires a careful modelling of
pulsations in these magnetic stars. In light of this, in this work we present a
theoretical analysis of pulsations in roAp stars, taking into account the
direct influence of the magnetic field. We derive approximate analytical
solutions for the displacement components parallel and perpendicular to the
direction of the magnetic field, that are appropriate to the outermost layer.
From these, we determine the expression for the theoretical radial velocity for
an observer at a general position, and compute the corresponding pulsation
amplitude and phase as function of height in the atmosphere. We show that the
integral for the radial velocity has contributions from three different types
of wave solutions, namely, running waves, evanescent waves, and standing waves
of nearly constant amplitude. We then consider a number of case studies to
illustrate the origin of the different pulsational behaviour that is found in
the observations. Concerning pulsation amplitude, we find that it generally
increases with atmospheric height. Pulsation phase, however, shows a diversity
of behaviours, including phases that are constant, increasing, or decreasing
with atmospheric height. Finally, we show that there are situations in which
the pulsation amplitude goes through a zero, accompanied by a phase jumps of
$\pi$, and argue that such behaviour does not correspond to a pulsation node in
the outermost layers of the star, but rather to a visual effect, resulting from
the observers inability to resolve the stellar surface.

ring can be clarified by establishing the entanglement trapped in any portion

the resulting topological state may depend on the specific closure scheme that
is followed. To understand the impact of this ambiguity in contexts of
practical interest, such as knot localization in a ring with non trivial
topology, we apply various closure schemes to model ring polymers. The rings
have the same length and topological state (a trefoil knot) but have different
degree of compactness. The comparison suggests that a novel method, termed the
minimally-interfering closure, can be profitably used to characterize the arc
entanglement in a robust and computationally-efficient way. This closure method
is finally applied to the knot localization problem which is tackled using two
different localization schemes based on top-down or bottom-up searches.

1 performed by the MAGIC-I ground-based gamma-ray telescope between November
2008 and March 2009 for a total of 43.2 hours. No significant gamma-ray
emission was found above the background. Differential upper limits on the
gamma-ray flux are derived assuming various power-law slopes for the possible
emission spectrum. Integral upper limits are also calculated for several
power-law spectra and for different energy thresholds. The values are of the
order of 10^{-11} ph cm^{-2}$ s^{-1} above 100 GeV and 10^{-12} ph cm^{-2}
s^{-1} above 200 GeV. Segue 1 is currently considered one of the most
interesting targets for indirect dark matter searches. In these terms, the
upper limits have been also interpreted in the context of annihilating dark
matter particles. For such purpose, we performed a grid scan over a reasonable
portion of the parameter space for the minimal SuperGravity model and computed
the flux upper limit for each point separately, taking fully into account the
peculiar spectral features of each model. We found that in order to match the
experimental upper limits with the model predictions, a minimum flux boost of
10^{3} is required, and that the upper limits are quite dependent on the shape
of the gamma-ray energy spectrum predicted by each specific model. Finally we
compared the upper limits with the predictions of some dark matter models able
to explain the PAMELA rise in the positron ratio, finding that Segue 1 data are
in tension with the dark matter explanation of the PAMELA spectrum in the case
of a dark matter candidate annihilating into tau+tau-. A complete exclusion
however is not possible due to the uncertainties in the Segue 1 astrophysical
factor.

I present a way to also estimate the spin-independent (SI) WIMP-nucleon

of the velocity distribution of halo WIMPs as well as (practically) of the as

dominates, and results of such data analyses are also expressed as functions of

generators eventually appear in almost all degrees permitted by
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. This suggests in particular that a
widely-accepted intuition derived from the case of curves -- namely that
syzygies become simpler as the degree of the embedding increases -- may have

doctrine that an idea has both an extension and an intension. In this paper we
introduce an intensional FOL (First-order-logic) for P2P systems by fusing the
Bealer's intensional algebraic FOL with the S5 possible-world semantics of the
Montague, we define the intensional equivalence relation for this logic and the
weak deductive inference for it. The notion of ontology has become widespread
in semantic Web. The meaning of concepts and views defined over some database
ontology can be considered as intensional objects which have particular
extension in some possible world: for instance in the actual world. Thus, non
invasive mapping between completely independent peer databases in a P2P systems
can be naturally specified by the set of couples of intensionally equivalent
views, which have the same meaning (intension), over two different peers. Such
a kind of mapping has very different semantics from the standard view-based
mappings based on the material implication commonly used for Data Integration.
We show how a P2P database system may be embedded into this intensional modal
FOL, and how we are able to obtain a weak non-omniscient inference, which can
be effectively implemented. For a query answering we consider non omniscient
query agents and we define object-oriented class for them which implements as
method the query rewriting algorithm. Finally, we show that this query
answering algorithm is sound and complete w.r.t. the weak deduction of the P2P
intensional logic.

strongly depends on the structure of the exotic Higgs models which contain
higher isospin $SU(2)_L$ representations such as triplet Higgs bosons. We study
the possibility of measuring the $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertex via single charged

$e^+e^-\to H^\pm W^\mp \to \ell \nu jj$ is analyzed assuming the polarized

reduced to a considerable extent by imposing the kinematic cuts even if we take
into account the initial state radiation. For a relatively light charged Higgs
boson whose mass $m_{H^\pm}$ is in the region of 120-130 GeV $< m_{H^\pm} <
m_W+m_Z$, the $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertex would be precisely testable especially

unprecedented sky coverage and precision it seems timely to investigate the
effects of general relativistic nonlinear dynamics on the growth of structures

indispensable way of investigating and understanding these effects in a
simplified context.
  In this paper, we develop exact inhomogeneous solutions of general relativity
with pressureless matter (dust, describing cold dark matter) and cosmological
constant $\Lambda$, which can be used to model an arbitrary initial matter
distribution along one line of sight. In particular, we consider the second
class Szekeres models with $\Lambda$ and split their dynamics into a flat
$\Lambda$CDM background and exact nonlinear inhomogeneities, obtaining several
new results. One single metric function $Z$ describes the deviation from the
background. We show that $F$, the time dependent part of $Z$, satisfies the
familiar linear differential equation for $\delta$, the first-order density
perturbation of dust, with the usual growing and decaying modes. In the limit
of small perturbations, $\delta \approx F$ as expected, and the growth of
inhomogeneities links up exactly with standard perturbation theory. We provide
analytic expressions for the exact nonlinear $\delta$ and the growth factor in
our models. For the case of over-densities, we find that, depending on the
initial conditions, the growing mode may or may not lead to a pancake
singularity, analogous to a Zel'dovich pancake. This is in contrast with the

control of the solution, and thus, an effective accurate resolution independent
of the fastest physical time scale. An important improvement of the
computational efficiency is achieved whenever the required time steps go beyond
standard stability constraints associated with mesh size or source time scales

constraint related to the dielectric relaxation time scale is respected but
with a second order precision. Numerical illustrations show that the strategy
can be efficiently applied to simulate the propagation of highly nonlinear

source and are used to calibrate `target' observations: they are therefore
rarely imaged themselves. The observations used span a time range ~ 1984 - 2008
and consist of eight different pointings, three different frequencies (8.4, 4.8

transient and variable radio sources within these observations using components
from the prototype LOFAR transient detection system. In this paper we present
the methodology for reducing large volumes of Very Large Array data; and we
also present a brief overview of the prototype LOFAR transient detection
algorithms. No radio transients were detected in this survey, therefore we
place an upper limit on the snapshot rate of GHz frequency transients > 8.0 mJy
to rho less than or equal to 0.032 deg^-2 that have typical timescales 4.3 to
45.3 days. We compare and contrast our upper limit with the snapshot rates -

N - Log S distribution formed from previous surveys, we show that our upper
limit is consistent with the observed population. Current and future radio
transient surveys will hopefully further constrain these statistics, and
potentially discover dominant transient source populations. In this paper we

agreement model, we propose the Mixed model that takes into account two
psychological types of individuals. Concord agents (C-agents) are friendly
people; they interact in a way that their opinions get closer always. Agents of
the other psychological type show partial antagonism in their interaction
(PA-agents). Opinion dynamics in heterogeneous social groups, consisting of
agents of the two types, was studied on different social networks. Limit cases
of the mixed model, pure C- and PA-societies, were also studied. We found that
group opinion formation is, qualitatively, almost independent of the topology
of networks used in this work. Opinion fragmentation, polarization and
consensus are observed in the mixed model at different proportions of PA- and
C-agents, depending on the value of initial opinion tolerance of agents. As for
the opinion formation and arising of ""dissidents"", the opinion dynamics of the
C-agents society was found to be similar to that of the DW model, except for
the rate of opinion convergence. Nevertheless, mixed societies showed dynamics
and bifurcation patterns notably different to those of the DW model. The
influence of biased initial conditions over opinion formation in heterogeneous
social groups was also studied versus the initial value of opinion uncertainty,
varying the proportion of the PA- to C-agents. Bifurcation diagrams showed
impressive evolution of collective opinion, in particular, radical change of
left to right consensus or vice versa at an opinion uncertainty value equal to
0.7 in the model with the PA/C mixture of population near 50/50.

reasonable linear and angular momenta are proposed for such bodies and exact

on a certain ""effective metric"" that is closely related to a non-perturbative
generalization of the Detweiler-Whiting R-field originally introduced in the
self-force literature. If the effective metric inside a self-gravitating body
can be adequately approximated by an appropriate power series, the
instantaneous gravitational force and torque exerted on it is shown to be
identical to the force and torque exerted on an appropriate test body moving in
the effective metric. This result holds to all multipole orders. The only
instantaneous effect of a body's self-field is to finitely renormalize the
""bare"" multipole moments of its stress-energy tensor. The MiSaTaQuWa expression

individual spin control to nanoscale multi-electron systems, as individual
spins are often irresolvable with existing methods. Here we demonstrate that
coherent individual spin control can be achieved with few-nm resolution for
proximal electron spins by performing single-spin magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), which is realized via a scanning magnetic field gradient that is both
strong enough to achieve nanometric spatial resolution and sufficiently stable
for coherent spin manipulations. We apply this scanning field-gradient MRI
technique to electronic spins in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and
achieve nanometric resolution in imaging, characterization, and manipulation of
individual spins. For NV centers, our results in individual spin control
demonstrate an improvement of nearly two orders of magnitude in spatial
resolution compared to conventional optical diffraction-limited techniques.
This scanning-field-gradient microscope enables a wide range of applications
including materials characterization, spin entanglement, and nanoscale
magnetometry.

simulations depend on their environment. The term environment has been used to
describe a wide variety of measures that may or may not correlate with each
other. Popular measures of environment include the distance to the N'th nearest
neighbour, the number density of objects within some distance, or the mass of
the host dark matter halo. We use results from the Millennium simulation and a
semi-analytic model for galaxy formation to quantify the relations between
environment and halo mass. We show that the environmental parameters used in
the observational literature are in effect measures of halo mass, even if they
are measured for a fixed stellar mass. The strongest correlation between
environment and halo mass arises when the number of objects is counted out to a
distance of 1.5-2 times the virial radius of the host halo and when the
galaxies/haloes are required to be relatively bright/massive. For observational
studies the virial radius is not easily determined, but the number of
neighbours out to 1-2 Mpc/h gives a similarly strong correlation. For the
distance to the N'th nearest neighbour the correlation with halo mass is nearly
as strong provided N>2. We demonstrate that this environmental parameter
becomes insensitive to halo mass if it is constructed from dimensionless
quantities. This can be achieved by scaling the minimum luminosity/mass of
neighbours to that of the object in question and by dividing the distance to a
length scale associated with either the neighbour or the galaxy under
consideration. We show how such a halo mass independent environmental parameter
can be defined for observational and numerical studies. The results presented
here will help future studies to disentangle the effects of halo mass and
external environment on the properties of galaxies and dark matter haloes.

thought of as a naturally occurring control system which plays a significant
role in regulating both star formation rates and the X-ray luminosity of the
surrounding hot gas. In the simplest case, negative feedback can be viewed as a
system response that is `optimised' to minimise deviations from equilibrium,
such that the system rapidly evolves towards a steady state. However, a general
solution of this form appears to be incompatible with radio observations which
indicate intermittent AGN outbursts. Here, we explore an energetically
favourable scenario in which feedback is required to both balance X-ray gas
cooling, and minimise the sum of the energy radiated by the gas and the energy
injected by the AGN. This specification is equivalent to ensuring that AGN
heating balances the X-ray gas cooling with minimum black hole growth. It is
shown that minimum energy heating occurs in discrete events, and not at a
continuous, constant level. Furthermore, systems with stronger feedback
experience proportionally more powerful heating events, but correspondingly
smaller duty cycles. Interpreting observations from this perspective would
imply that stronger feedback occurs in less massive objects - elliptical
galaxies, rather than galaxy clusters. One direct consequence of this effect
would be that AGN heating events are sufficiently powerful to expel hot gas
from the gravitational potential of a galaxy, but not a galaxy cluster, which
is consistent with theoretical explanations for the steepening of the L_X-T
relation at temperatures below 1-2 keV.

magnitude and yields Period-Luminosity (PL) relations with dispersions
comparable to the best LMC samples. We fit the sample using the OGLE-II LMC PL
relations and are unable to find a self-consistent distance for different band
combinations or radial locations within M81. We can do so after adding a radial
dependence to the PL zero point that corresponds to a luminosity dependence on
metallicity of g_mu=-0.56+/-0.36 mag/dex. We find marginal evidence for a shift
in color as a function of metallicity, distinguishable from the effects of

measuring weak gravitational lensing flexions, the gradients of the lensing

previously published methods for measuring flexions focus on measuring derived
properties of the lensed images, such as shapelet coefficients or surface

simulated data images with realistic noise and a variety of unlensed image
properties, and show that it successfully reproduces the input flexion fields.
We also apply the AIM method for flexion measurement to Hubble Space Telescope
observations of Abell 1689, and detect mass structure in the cluster using

ramified allocation problem aims at finding an optimal allocation plan as well
as an associated optimal allocation path to minimize overall cost of
transporting commodity from factories to households. This problem
differentiates itself from existing ramified transportation literature in that
the distribution of production among factories is not fixed but endogenously
determined as observed in many allocation practices. It's shown that due to the
transport economy of scale in ramified transportation, each optimal allocation
plan corresponds equivalently to an optimal assignment map from households to

sees that pulsars with similar energetics have Fgamma/Fx spanning 3 decades.
Such spread, most probably stemming from vastly different geometrical

straightforward interpretation of the plot. Indeed, while energetic pulsars do
have low Fgamma/Fx values, little can be said for the bulk of the Fermi neutron
stars. Dividing our pulsar sample into radio-loud and radio-quiet subsamples,
we find that, on average, radio-quiet pulsars do have higher values of
Fgamma/Fx, implying an intrinsec faintness of their X-ray emission and/or a
different geometrical configuration. Moreover, despite the large spread
mentioned above, statistical tests show a lower scatter in the radio-quiet

(static) state estimation problems, in which the state vector consists of the
voltage magnitude and angle at all network buses. We consider the state to be
linearly related to network measurements, which include power flows, current
injections, and voltages phasors at some buses. We admit the presence of
several cooperating control centers, and we design two distributed methods for
them to compute the minimum variance estimate of the state given the network

cooperation among control centers: in the first method an incremental mode of
cooperation is used, whereas, in the second method, a diffusive interaction is
implemented. Our procedures, which require each control center to know only the
measurements and structure of a subpart of the whole network, are
computationally efficient and scalable with respect to the network dimension,
provided that the number of control centers also increases with the network
cardinality. Additionally, a finite-memory approximation of our diffusive

we simply compare main sequence stars and subgiant stars, with an offset of
around 2.5 Gyrs between the peaks of both distributions. Also we show evidence
for an increased spin-down timescale for cool K dwarfs compared with earlier F

inactive stars for future planet search projects. We see the well known trend
between projected rotational velocity and activity, however we also find a
correlation between kinematic space velocity and chromospheric activity. It
appears that after the Vaughan-Preston gap there is a quick step function in
the kinematic space motion towards a significantly larger spread in velocities.
We speculate on reasons for this correlation and provide some model scenarios
to describe the bimodal activity distribution through magnetic saturation,
residual low level gas accretion or accretion by the star of planets or
planetesimals. Finally, we provide a new empirical measurement for the disk

systems perspective. Written in terms of Kerr-Schild coordinates, the null
geodesic equation takes on the simple form of a particle moving under the
influence of a Newtonian central force with an inverse-cubic potential. We
apply a McGehee transformation to these equations, which clearly elucidates the
full phase space of solutions. All the null geodesics belong to one of four
families of invariant manifolds and their limiting cases, further characterized
by the angular momentum L of the orbit: for |L|>|L_c|, (1) the set that flow
outward from the white hole, turn around, then fall into the black hole, (2)
the set that fall inward from past null infinity, turn around outside the black
hole to continue to future null infinity, and for |L|<|L_c|, (3) the set that
flow outward from the white hole and continue to future null infinity, (4) the
set that flow inward from past null infinity and into the black hole. The
critical angular momentum Lc corresponds to the unstable circular orbit at
r=3M, and the homoclinic orbits associated with it. There are two additional
critical points of the flow at the singularity at r=0. Though the solutions of
geodesic motion and Hamiltonian flow we describe here are well known, what we
believe is a novel aspect of this work is the mapping between the two
equivalent descriptions, and the different insights each approach can give to
the problem. For example, the McGehee picture points to a particularly
interesting limiting case of the class (1) that move from the white to black
hole: in the limit as L goes to infinity, as described in Schwarzschild
coordinates, these geodesics begin at r=0, flow along t=constant lines, turn
around at r=2M, then continue to r=0. During this motion they circle in azimuth
exactly once, and complete the journey in zero affine time.

We also use the hybrid boundary condition method for this purpose which is
designed to lift the two-meson states in energy while leaving the tetraquark
mesonium unchanged. We find that the volume method is not effective in the
present case due to the fact that the scattering states spectrum is closely
packed for such heavy states so that one cannot separate out individual
scattering states since the volume dependence is skewed as a result. However,
the hybrid boundary condition method works and we found that the four-quark

conclude that we do not see a tetraquark mesonium in the Ds0*(2317) meson

the cold dust component, shock-powered [CII]158um emission can significantly
contribute to the emission in the 160 um band that shows a single peak at the
shocked region. In the shocked region, the observed gas-to-dust mass ratio is
in agreement with the Galactic one. The color temperature of the cold dust

noninteracting modes embedded in a thermal environment. Entanglement and
discord are used to quantify the quantum correlations of the system. For all
values of the temperature of the thermal reservoir, an initial separable
Gaussian state remains separable for all times. We study the time evolution of
logarithmic negativity, which characterizes the degree of entanglement, and
show that in the case of an entangled initial Gaussian state, entanglement
suppression (entanglement sudden death) takes place, for non-zero temperatures
of the environment. Only for a zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial
entangled state remains entangled for finite times. We analyze the time
evolution of the Gaussian quantum discord, which is a measure of all quantum
correlations in the bipartite state, including entanglement, and show that
quantum discord decays asymptotically in time under the effect of the thermal
bath. This is contrast with the sudden death of entanglement. Before the
suppression of the entanglement, the qualitative evolution of quantum discord
is very similar to that of the entanglement. We describe also the time
evolution of the degree of classical correlations and of quantum mutual
information, which measures the total correlations of the quantum system.

these conditions, the screw-like growth could be avoided. Unfortunately, the
helium cooling deteriorates the melting behavior of the feed rod. Spikes appear
along the open melt front, which touch on the induction coil. In order to
improve the melting behavior, we used a lamp as a second energy source as well
as a mixture of Ar and He. With this, we found a final solution for growing
stable crystals from germanium by using both gases in different parts of the
furnace. The experimental work is accompanied by the simulation of the
stationary temperature field. The commercially available software FEMAG-FZ is
used for axisymmetric calculations. Another tool for process development is the
lateral photo-voltage scanning (LPS), which can determine the shape of the
solid-liquid phase boundary by analyzing the growth striations in a lateral cut
of a grown crystal. In addition to improvements of the process, these
measurements can be compared with the calculated results and, hence, conduce to
validate the calculation.

pursued for functional models in earlier attempts is reviewed using a new
formalism in terms of deviation (matrix) traces. Within the framework of
classical error models, the dependent variable relates to the independent
variable according to the usual additive model. Linear models of regression
lines are considered in the general case of correlated errors in X and in Y for
heteroscedastic data. The special case of (C) generalized orthogonal regression
is considered in detail together with well known subcases. In the limit of
homoscedastic data, the results determined for functional models are compared
with their counterparts related to extreme structural models. While regression
line slope and intercept estimators for functional and structural models
necessarily coincide, the contrary holds for related variance estimators even
if the residuals obey a Gaussian distribution, with a single exception. An
example of astronomical application is considered, concerning the [O/H]-[Fe/H]
empirical relations deduced from five samples related to different stars and/or
different methods of oxygen abundance determination. For selected samples and
assigned methods, different regression models yield consistent results within
the errors for both heteroscedastic and homoscedastic data. Conversely, samples
related to different methods produce discrepant results, due to the presence of
(still undetected) systematic errors, which implies no definitive statement can
be made at present. A comparison is also made between different expressions of
regression line slope and intercept variance estimators, where fractional
discrepancies are found to be not exceeding a few percent, which grows up to
about 20% in presence of large dispersion data.

analysis of the intracluster medium (ICM) and cavity system in the galaxy
cluster RBS 797. In addition to the two previously known cavities in the
cluster core, the new and deeper X-ray image has revealed additional structure
associated with the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The surface brightness
decrements of the two cavities are unusually large, and are consistent with
elongated cavities lying close to our line-of-sight. We estimate a total AGN
outburst energy and mean jet power of $\approx 3 - 6 \times 10^{60}$ erg and
$\approx 3 - 6 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively, depending on the
assumed geometrical configuration of the cavities. Thus, RBS 797 is apparently
among the the most powerful AGN outbursts known in a cluster. The average mass
accretion rate needed to power the AGN by accretion alone is $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$. We show that accretion of cold gas onto the AGN at this level is
plausible, but that Bondi accretion of the hot atmosphere is probably not. The
BCG harbors an unresolved, non-thermal nuclear X-ray source with a bolometric
luminosity of $\approx 2 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The nuclear emission is
probably associated with a rapidly-accreting, radiatively inefficient accretion
flow. We present tentative evidence that star formation in the BCG is being
triggered by the radio jets and suggest that the cavities may be driving weak
shocks ($M \sim 1.5$) into the ICM, similar to the process in the galaxy
cluster MS 0735.6+7421.

shown that the interplay between the spin-dependent quasiparticle distribution
and the triplet superconducting correlations induced by the proximity effect
between the superconducting leads and ferromagnetic elements of the interlayer,
leads to the appearence of an additional contribution to the Josephson current.
This additional contribution $j_t$ can be extracted from the full Josephson
current in experiment. The features of the additional supercurrent $j_t$, which
are of main physical interest are the following: (i) We propose the
experimental setup, where the contributions given by the short-range (SRTC) and
long-range (LRTC) components of triplet superconducting correlations in the
interlayer can be measured separately. It can be realized on the basis of
S/N/F/N/S junction, where the interlayer is composed of two normal metal
regions with a spiral ferromagnet layer sandwiched between them. For the case
of tunnel junctions the measurement of $j_t$ in such a system can provide
direct information about the energy-resolved anomalous Green's function
components describing SRTC and LRTC. (ii) In some cases the exchange
field-suppressed supercurrent can be not only recovered but also enhanced with
respect to its value for non-magnetic junction with the same interface
resistances by the presence of spin-dependent quasiparticle distribution. This
effect is demonstrated for S/N/S junction with magnetic S/N interfaces. In
addition, it is also found that under the considered conditions the dependence
of the Josephson current on temperature can be nontrivial: at first the current
rises upon temperature increasing and only after that starts to decline.

  We find that the mean bond life time $<\tau>$ decreases upon adsorption by
more than an order of magnitude even for brush molecules with comparatively

well-known L\'evy process: The compound Poisson process. The semi-Markov
extension of the compound Poisson process naturally leads to the compound
fractional Poisson process, where the Poisson counting process is replaced by
the Mittag-Leffler counting process also known as fractional Poisson process.
This process is no longer Markovian and L\'evy. However, several analytical
results are available and some of them are discussed here. The functional limit
of the compound Poisson process is an $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process, whereas
in the case of the compound fractional Poisson process, one gets an
$\alpha$-stable L\'evy process subordinated to the fractional Poisson process.

primary one is, given two quantum channels M and N, to find a quantum channel R

fidelity. The dual problem involves the information obtained by the environment
through the so-called complementary channels M* and N*, and consists in finding
a quantum channel R' such that R'M* is optimally close to N*. It turns out to
be easier to find an approximate solution to the dual problem in certain
important situations, notably when M is the identity channel---the problem of
quantum error correction---yielding a good near-optimal worst-case entanglement
fidelity as well as the corresponding near-optimal correcting channel. Here we
provide more detailed proofs of these results. In addition, we generalize the
main theorem to the case where there are certain constraints on the
implementation of R, namely on the number of Kraus operators. We also offer a
simple algebraic form for the near-optimal correction channel in the case M=id.
For approximate error correction, we show that any epsilon-correctable channel
is, up to appending an ancilla, epsilon-close to an exactly correctable one. We
also demonstrate an application of our theorem to the problem of minimax state

noise error contribution of these derivative estimations is investigated: after
proving the existence of such integral with a stochastic process noise, their

static external field with spatial periodic oscillations in one direction, the
bulk critical point splits into two new critical points and a triple point.
This phenomenon is called laser-induced condensation [Mol. Phys. Vol. 101, Pg.
1651 (2003)], and it occurs when the wavelength of the field is sufficiently
large. The critical points mark the end of two coexistence regions, namely
between (1) a vapor and stacked-fluid phase, and (2) a stacked-fluid and liquid
phase. The stacked-fluid or ""zebra"" phase is characterized by large density
oscillations along the field direction. We study the above phenomenon for a
mixture of colloids and polymers using density functional theory and computer
simulation. The theory predicts that the vapor-zebra and liquid-zebra surface
tensions are extremely small. Most strikingly, however, is the theoretical
finding that at their respective critical points, both tensions vanish, but not
according to any critical power law. The solution to this apparent paradox is
provided by the simulations. These show that the field divides the system into
effectively two-dimensional slabs, stacked on top of each other along the field
direction. Inside each slab, the system behaves as if it were two-dimensional,
while in the field direction the system resembles a one-dimensional Ising

from binary atomic collisions in a polarized gas from magnetic dipole-dipole

parameters (-1.5 $<$ log[U] $<$ 0), yet its kinematics are similar to those of

modelled by the presence of a mildly ionised ({\xi}\leq30) reflection component

components with 10^{20} \leq N_H \leq 10^{23} cm^{-2} and 0 \leq log({\xi})/erg

longitude system of the young solar analogue HD 116956 in detail, especially
concentrating on determining the rotation period of the spot-generating
mechanism with respect to the photometric rotation period of the star itself.
Because the nonparametric approach, like the Kuiper method, can only give the
period of active longitudes, we formulate a new method that can determine the
parameters the active longitude distribution uniquely.
  Methods: For this purpose, we have developed an analysis method, based on
Bayesian statistics using Markov chain Monte Carlo, presented in this
manuscript. One of the advantages of this method is that an estimate of the
active longitude system rotation period, as well as the parameters of the shape
and location of the active longitudes together with their respective error
estimates. This allows us to compare the active longitude and mean photospheric
rotation periods of the star.
  Results: Our analysis confirms previous results of the object having two
stable active longitudes with a phase difference of Delta phi = 0.5, the other
longitude having dominated over the other one during almost the entire span of
the time series. Our method gives the rotation period of the active longitude
system P_al = 7.8412 +- 0.00002 d, which is significantly different from the
mean photospheric rotation period of the star P_rot = 7.817 +- 0.003 d.
  Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that the spot-generating mechanism,
manifesting itself as a system of two active longitudes, is lagging behind the
overall rotation of the star. This behaviour may be interpreted as a
nonaxisymmetric dynamo wave propagating in the rotational reference frame of
the stellar surface.

develop a model which includes all signalling steps in the pathway, and discuss
a simplified version, which captures the essential features of the full model.
We find that the noise characteristics of the motor contain signatures from all

center a very bright, red, diffuse intracluster light due to an old, stellar
population, so bright to be named as ""star pile"". Our analysis is based on
redshift data for 110 galaxies. We identify 95 cluster members and analyze the
cluster internal dynamics by combining galaxy velocities and positions. We also
use both photometric and X-ray data. We estimate the cluster redshift,
z=0.1580, a velocity dispersion of 1200 km/s, and ICM temperature kT_X~8 keV.
Our optical and X-ray analyses detect substructures. Optical data reveal three
main galaxy clumps (center, NNW, and NE), and possibly a fourth clump at South.
There is not a dominant galaxy and the four brightest galaxies avoid the
cluster core (>~0.4h distant from the cluster center) and are >~1500 km/s far
from the mean cluster velocity. The analysis of the X-ray surface brightness
distribution provides us evidence of a disturbed dynamical phase. Located in
the star pile region there is the brightest galaxies of the cluster core (CBCG)
and a very compact elliptical galaxy. We show that the star pile has a similar
redshift to that of the CBCG. Both the star pile and the CBCG are at rest in
the cluster rest frame. The emerging picture of Abell 545 is that of a massive,
M(R<1.6 h_70^-1 Mpc)=1.1-1.8x10^15 h_70^-1 Msun, very complex cluster with
merging occurring along two directions. A545 gives another proof in the favor
of the connection between cluster merger and extended, diffuse radio emission.
The star pile, likely due to the process of a brightest galaxy forming in the

simultaneous formation of a galaxy system and its brightest galaxy.

Frege-Russell's doctrine that an idea (logic formula) has both an extension and

we analyze the minimal intensional semantic enrichment of the syntax of the FOL
language, by unification of different views: Tarskian extensional semantics of
the FOL, modal interpretation of quantifiers, and a derivation of the Tarskian
theory of truth from unified semantic theory based on a single meaning
relation. We show that not all modal predicate logics are intensional, and that
an equivalent modal Kripke's interpretation of logic quantifiers in FOL results
in a particular pure extensional modal predicate logic (as is the standard
Tarskian semantics of the FOL). This minimal intensional enrichment is obtained
by adopting the theory of properties, relations and propositions (PRP) as the
universe or domain of the FOL, composed by particulars and universals (or
concepts), with the two-step interpretation of the FOL that eliminates the weak
points of the Montague's intensional semantics. Differently from the Bealer's
intensional FOL, we show that it is not necessary the introduction of the

Maxwell's equations provide the effective model for maximally reducible

For both options, as well as for their fermionic counterparts, one can extend
the analogy beyond the equations for the gauge potentials, formulating the
corresponding Lagrangians in terms of higher-spin curvatures. The associated

SQL3, using a model that integrates time in a native manner. To do this, we
propose new keywords and syntax to define different temporal versions for many
relational operators and functions used in SQL. It then becomes possible to
perform various queries and updates appropriate to temporal facts. We
illustrate the use of these proposals on many examples from a real application.

Such a particle would be abundant inside air showers, as it can be produced in

distribution (E_\nu = 0.1--10 TeV and \theta < 90^o), which results from a
balance between the reach of the heavy neutrino (that disfavors low energies)
and a sizeable production rate and decay probability. The standard background
from contained neutrino events (\nu_e N \to e X and neutral-current
interactions of high inelasticity) is 100 times smaller. Therefore, although it

electromagnetic responses of dispersive continuous media in non-relativistic
phenomena is generalized to accommodate the constraints required of a causal
formulation in spacetimes with background gravitational fields. In particular
the concepts of spatial material inhomogeneity and temporal non-stationarity
are formulated within a fully covariant spacetime framework. This framework is
illustrated by re-casting the Maxwell-Vlasov equations for a collisionless
plasma in a form that exposes a 2-point electromagnetic susceptibility kernel
in spacetime. This permits the establishment of a perturbative scheme for
non-stationary inhomogeneous plasma configurations. Explicit formulae for the
perturbed kernel are derived in both the presence and absence of gravitation
using the general solution to the relativistic equations of motion of the
plasma constituents. In the absence of gravitation this permits an analysis of
collisionless damping in terms of a system of integral equations that reduce to
standard Landau damping of Langmuir modes when the perturbation refers to a
homogeneous stationary plasma configuration. It is concluded that constitutive
modelling in terms of a 2-point susceptibility kernel in a covariant spacetime
framework offers a natural extension of standard non-relativistic descriptions
of simple media and that its use for describing linear responses of more
general dispersive media has wide applicability in relativistic plasma
modelling.

for the dark energy that presently dominates the universe. This quintessence
field is expected to couple directly to matter components, unless some symmetry
of a more fundamental theory protects or suppresses it. Such a coupling would
leave distinctive signatures in the background expansion history of the
universe and on cosmic structure formation, particularly at galaxy cluster
scales. Using semi--analytic expressions for the CDM halo mass function, we
make predictions for halo abundance in models where the quintessence scalar
field is coupled to cold dark matter, for a variety of quintessence potentials.
We evaluate the linearly extrapolated density contrast at the redshift of
collapse using the spherical collapse model and we compare this result to the
corresponding prediction obtained from the non--linear perturbation equations
in the Newtonian limit. For all the models considered in this work, if there is
a continuous flow of energy from the quintessence scalar field to the CDM
component, then the predicted number of CDM haloes can only lie below that of
$\Lambda$CDM, when each model shares the same cosmological parameters today. In
the last stage of our analysis we perform a global MCMC fit to data to find the
best fit values for the cosmological model parameters. We find that for some
forms of the quintessence potential, coupled dark energy models can offer a
viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in light of the recent detections of massive
high--$z$ galaxy clusters, while other models of coupled quintessence predict a
smaller number of massive clusters at high redshift compared to $\Lambda$CDM.

information on sky position, distance, blue magnitude, major and minor
diameters, position angle, and galaxy type for 53,255 galaxies. Errors on these

our understanding of the uncertainties associated with the measurement method.
By using the PGC numbering system developed for HyperLEDA, the catalogue has a
reduced level of degeneracies compared to catalogues with a similar purpose and
is easily updated. We also include 150 Milky Way globular clusters. Finally, we
compare the GWGC to previously used catalogues, and find the GWGC to be more

  Since the rules are in English, they are indexed by Google and other search

  The design of the system integrates the semantics of data, with a semantics
of an inference method, and also with the meanings of English sentences. As
such, the system has functionality that may be useful for the Rules, Logic,
Proof and Trust requirements of the Semantic Web.
  The system accepts rules, and small numbers of facts, typed or copy-pasted
directly into a browser. One can then run the rules, again using a browser. For
larger amounts of data, the system uses information in the rules to
automatically generate and run SQL over networked databases. From a few highly
declarative rules, the system typically generates SQL that would be too
complicated to write reliably by hand. However, the system can explain its
results in step-by-step hypertexted English, at the business or scientific

to other dwarf galaxies UGC 1281 is a normal dwarf galaxy with a slowly rising
rotation curve that flattens off at 60 km/s and a central depression in its HI
distribution. Its HI extends 70"" (1.8 kpc) in projection from the plane. This

purely edge-on warp with rotational velocities that decline with a vertical
gradient of 10.6 \pm 3.7 km/s/kpc. The line-of-sight warp model is the

stable periodic orbits the GALIs tend to zero following particular power laws
for Hamiltonian flows, while they fluctuate around non-zero values for
symplectic maps. By comparison, the GALIs of unstable periodic orbits tend
exponentially to zero, both for flows and maps. We also apply the GALIs for
investigating the dynamics in the neighborhood of periodic orbits, and show
that for chaotic solutions influenced by the homoclinic tangle of unstable
periodic orbits, the GALIs can exhibit a remarkable oscillatory behavior during
which their amplitudes change by many orders of magnitude. Finally, we use the
GALI method to elucidate further the connection between the dynamics of
Hamiltonian flows and symplectic maps. In particular, we show that, using for
the computation of GALIs the components of deviation vectors orthogonal to the

still lacking. Our results and analysis concerning the temperature dependence
of structural, vibrational and thermodynamical properties of the orthorhombic
polymorph of the amino acid L-cysteine (at a hydration level of 3.5%) indicated
that the two referred temperatures define the triggering of very simple and
specific events that govern all the biochemical interactions of the
biomolecule: activation of rigid rotors ($T<T^{*}$), phonon-phonon interactions
with phonons of water dimer ($T^{*}<T<T_{D}$), and water rotational barriers
surpassing ($T>T_{D}$).

variety of spectral shapes. The spectrum can retain the shape of a Planck
function or it can be broadened and have the shape of a Band function. This
fact is best illustrated by studying GRB090902B: The main gamma-ray spectral
component is initially close to a Planck function, which can only be explained
by emission from the jet photosphere. Later, the same component evolves into a
broader Band function. This burst thus provides observational evidence that the
photosphere can give rise to a non-thermal spectrum. We show that such a
broadening is most naturally explained by subphotospheric dissipation in the
jet. The broadening mainly depends on the strength and location of the
dissipation, on the magnetic field strength, and on the relation between the
energy densities of thermal photons and of the electrons. We suggest that the
evolution in spectral shape observed in GRB090902B is due to a decrease of the
bulk Lorentz factor of the flow, leading to the main dissipation becoming
subphotospheric. Such a change in the flow parameters can also explain the
correlation observed between the peak energy of the spectrum and low-energy
power law slope, alpha, a correlation commonly observed in GRBs. We conclude
that photospheric emission could indeed be a ubiquitous feature during the
prompt phase in GRBs and play a decisive role in creating the diverse spectral
shapes and spectral evolutions that are observed.

evolution by managing versions of the code and generating transformation

an initial boundary value problem, with boundary conditions imposed at null

time of existence of the solutions depending only on an invariant H^2-type norm

requires the introduction of a renormalized system of equations and relies

trades. When the capital level of one economic agent drops below a minimum, the
economic agent becomes insolvent. The insolvency of one single economic agent
affects the economic energy of all its neighbours which thus become susceptible
to insolvency, being able to trigger a chain of insolvencies (avalanche). We
show that the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power-law whose
exponent depends on the minimum capital level. Furthermore, we present evidence
that under an increase in the minimum capital level, large crashes will be
avoided only if one assumes that agents will accept a drop in business levels,
while keeping their trading attitudes and policies unchanged. The alternative
assumption, that agents will try to restore their business levels, may lead to
the unexpected consequence that large crises occur with higher probability.

of the standard forms of formulation of the law. However, it was mired in
advanced mathematics. The formulation was strongly criticized by Max Planck,
for it was based on the analysis of adiabatic processes and adiabatic
accessibility. A thermodynamic process is said to be possible only if it
satisfies both first law and the second law. A process is said to violate the
second law only when it satisfies the first law, and violate the second law. We
show here that violation of Caratheodory principle of the second law violates
the first law itself. In other words, adiabatic inaccessibility arises only as
a consequence of violation of the first law. This we demonstrate by assuming,
in contradiction to Caratheodory's principle, that the states considered
adiabatically inaccessible as adiabatically accessible, and prove that the
assumption leads to no paradox - thereby showing that the adiabatic
inaccessibility arises as a result of violation of the first law.
