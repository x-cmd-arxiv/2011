evolution. We use empirically determined stellar evolution models to predict
the past evolution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) Luminous Red
Galaxy (LRG) sample without any a-priori assumption about galaxy evolution. By
carefully contrasting the evolution of the predicted and observed number and
luminosity densities we test the passive evolution scenario for galaxies of
different luminosity, and determine minimum merger rates. We find that the LRG
population is not purely coeval, with some of galaxies targeted at z<0.23 and
at z>0.34 showing different dynamical growth than galaxies targeted throughout
the sample. Our results show that the LRG population is dynamically growing,
and that this growth must be dominated by the faint end. For the most luminous
galaxies, we find lower minimum merger rates than required by previous studies
that assume passive stellar evolution, suggesting that some of the dynamical
evolution measured previously was actually due to galaxies with non-passive
stellar evolution being incorrectly modelled. Our methodology can be used to
identify and match coeval populations of galaxies across cosmic times, over one
or more surveys.

the system parameters by fitting a parameterised model to the observed eclipse
light curve by chi-squared minimisation. We also present an updated analysis of
all other eclipsing systems previously analysed by our group. New donor masses
are generally between 1 and 2 sigma of those originally published, with the
exception of SDSS 1502 and DV UMa. We note that the donor mass of SDSS 1501 has
been revised upwards by 0.024Msun. This system was previously identified as
having evolved passed the minimum orbital period for cataclysmic variables, but
the new mass determination suggests otherwise. Our new analysis confirms that
SDSS 1035 and SDSS 1433 have evolved past the period minimum for cataclysmic
variables, corroborating our earlier studies. We find that the radii of donor
stars are oversized when compared to theoretical models, by approximately 10
percent. We show that this can be explained by invoking either enhanced angular
momentum loss, or by taking into account the effects of star spots. We are
unable to favour one cause over the other, as we lack enough precise mass
determinations for systems with orbital periods between 100 and 130 minutes,
where evolutionary tracks begin to diverge significantly. We also find a strong
tendency towards high white dwarf masses within our sample, and no evidence for
any He-core white dwarfs. The dominance of high mass white dwarfs implies that
erosion of the white dwarf during the nova outburst must be negligible, or that
not all of the mass accreted is ejected during nova cycles, resulting in the
white dwarf growing in mass. (Abridged)

the entries of an n x n matrix whose {-1,0,+1}-entries are governed by P_lcf
and fully independent (they are not when governed by P_chio), then an
asymptotically optimal bound on the singularity probability over Z can be
proved. We will characterize P_chio graph-theoretically and use the
characterization to prove that given a B in {-1,0,+1}^([n-1]^2), deciding
whether P_chio[B] = P_lcf[B] is equivalent to deciding an evasive graph
property, hence the time complexity of this decision is Omega(n^2). Moreover,
we will prove k-wise independence properties of P_chio.

current correlation functions in the Euclidean region, when approaching the
Minkowskian domain, violations of quark-hadron duality are expected to occur,
due to the presence of bound-state or resonance poles. In QCD finite-energy sum
rules, contour integrals in the complex energy plane down to the Minkowskian
axis have to be performed, and thus the question arises what the impact of
duality violations may be. The structure and possible relevance of duality
violations is investigated on the basis of two models: the Coulomb system and a
model for light-quark correlators which has already been studied previously. As
might yet be naively expected, duality violations are in some sense ""maximal""
for zero-width bound states and they become weaker for broader resonances whose
poles lie further away from the physical axis. Furthermore, to a certain
extent, they can be suppressed by choosing appropriate weight functions in the
finite-energy sum rules. A simplified Ansatz for including effects of duality
violations in phenomenological QCD sum rule analyses is discussed as well.

billiard. The nearest neighbor spacing distribution, level number variance and
spectral rigidity support the notion that the elliptic billiard is a generic
integrable system. However, second order statistics exhibit a novel property of
long-range oscillations. Classical simulation shows that all the periodic
orbits except two are not isolated. In Fourier analysis of the spectrum, all
the peaks correspond to periodic orbits. The two isolated periodic orbits have
small contribution to the fluctuation of level density, while non-isolated
periodic orbits have the main contribution. The heights of the majority of the
peaks match our semiclassical theory except for type-O periodic orbits.
Elliptic billiard is a nontrivial integrable system that will enrich our
understanding of integrable systems.

polygons, which are convex polygons such that all triangles formed by three
consecutive vertices have the same area. Besides being able to approximate
closed convex smooth curves almost uniformly with respect to affine length,
convex equal-area polygons admit natural definitions of the usual affine
differential geometry concepts, like affine normal and affine curvature. These
definitions lead to discrete analogous of the six vertices theorem and an
affine isoperimetric inequality. One can also define discrete counterparts of
the affine evolute, parallels and the affine distance symmetry set preserving
many of the properties valid for smooth curves.

a theoretical physicist and as an expert in particle accelerators during the

because of his Jewish origin from the maternal side, until he arrived in Italy
in the early 1950s and, in 1960, proposed to build AdA, in Frascati. The events
which led to Touschek's collaboration with Rolf Wideroe in the construction of
the first European betatron will be de- scribed. The article will make use of a
number of unpublished as well as previously unknown documents, which include an
early correspon- dence with Arnold Sommerfeld and Bruno Touschek's letters to
his family in Vienna from Italy, Germany and Great Britain. The impact of
Touschek's work on students and collaborators from University of Rome will be
illustrated through his work on QED infrared radiative corrections to high

as the convex hull of the brick vectors associated to each pseudoline

sum of matroid polytopes.
  Our brick polytopes include Hohlweg and Lange's many realizations of the
associahedron, which arise as brick polytopes for certain well-chosen sorting
networks. We furthermore discuss the brick polytopes of sorting networks
supporting pseudoline arrangements which correspond to multitriangulations of
convex polygons: our polytopes only realize subgraphs of the flip graphs on
multitriangulations and they cannot appear as projections of a hypothetical
multiassociahedron.

ATLAS-CONF-2010-088 could arise from about 10^{30} approximately degenerate
Kaluza-Klein states of the d = 11 supergravity multiplet in the s channel, that
could arise from compactification of d = 11 supergravity on a 7-manifold with a
compact hyperbolic Cartesian factor of intrinsic volume around 10^{34} and
curvature radius an inverse TeV. A first hypothesis that the modes in the bump
arise from a large degeneracy that restores agreement between the spectral
staircase and the Weyl asymptotic formula immediately above the spectral gap
gives a number of modes that is too large by a factor of around 60000. An
alternative hypothesis that the modes in the bump arise from harmonic forms on
the compact 7-manifold that are classically massless and acquire approximately
equal masses from the leading quantum corrections to the CJS action naturally
explains the slight reduction on a logarithmic scale in the number of modes
relative to the first hypothesis, and predicts that the bump is spin 0 if the
compact hyperbolic factor of large intrinsic volume is 7-dimensional, and a
mixture of spins 0 and 1 if it is 5-dimensional or 3-dimensional. Even
dimensions probably give too many modes. A provisional solution of the
quantum-corrected d = 11 Einstein equations on a compact hyperbolic 7-manifold
times 4 almost flat extended dimensions whose de Sitter radius can easily be as
large as the observed value is considered, and a Horava-Witten boundary is
introduced to accommodate the Standard Model fields.

each finite quiver $Q$ with a set of vertices $I$ the so-called Cohomological
Hall algebra $\cH,$ which is $\Z_{\geq 0}^I$-graded. Its graded component
$\cH_{\gamma}$ is defined as cohomology of Artin moduli stack of
representations with dimension vector $\gamma.$ The product comes from natural
correspondences which parameterize extensions of representations. In the case
of symmetric quiver, one can refine the grading to $\Z_{\geq 0}^I\times\Z,$ and
modify the product by a sign to get a super-commutative algebra $(\cH,\star)$
(with parity induced by $\Z$-grading). It is conjectured in \cite{KS} that in
this case the algebra $(\cH\otimes\Q,\star)$ is free super-commutative
generated by a $\Z_{\geq 0}^I\times\Z$-graded vector space of the form
$V=V^{prim}\otimes\Q[x],$ where $x$ is a variable of bidegree $(0,2)\in\Z_{\geq
0}^I\times\Z,$ and all the spaces
$\bigoplus\limits_{k\in\Z}V^{prim}_{\gamma,k},$ $\gamma\in\Z_{\geq 0}^I.$ are
finite-dimensional. In this paper we prove this conjecture (Theorem 1.1).
  We also prove some explicit bounds on pairs $(\gamma,k)$ for which
$V^{prim}_{\gamma,k}\ne 0$ (Theorem 1.2). Passing to generating functions, we
obtain the positivity result for quantum Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which was
used by S. Mozgovoy to prove Kac's conjecture for quivers with sufficiently

micron for angled tracks, and resolutions of between 4.4 and 11 micron for

3D sensor, which has significantly less charge sharing, was found to have an

approximation for the electron and holes density of states, which is valid at
arbitrary distance from the domain wall. Due to the electrons accumulation, the
static conductivity drastically increases at the inclined head-to-head wall by
1 order of magnitude for small incline angles theta pi/40 by up 3 orders of
magnitude for the counter domain wall (theta=pi/2). Two separate regions of the
space charge accumulation exist across an inclined tail-to-tail wall: the thin
region in the immediate vicinity of the wall with accumulated mobile holes and
the much wider region with ionized donors. The conductivity across the
tail-to-tail wall is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the one of the
head-to-head wall due to the low mobility of holes, which are improper carries.
The results are in qualitative agreement with recent experimental data for

the period P, semimajor axis a, and eccentricity e have been determined. These

system masses ranging from 2 x 10^17 to 2 x 10^22 kg. Based on the relative

transfer learning (STL), to effectively and efficiently encode user's labeling
information. STL is particularly designed for interactive video search
reranking. Technically, it a) considers the pair-wise discriminative
information to maximally separate labeled query relevant samples from labeled
query irrelevant ones, b) achieves a sparse representation for the subspace to
encodes user's intention by applying the elastic net penalty, and c) propagates
user's labeling information from labeled samples to unlabeled samples by using
the data distribution knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on the
TRECVID 2005, 2006 and 2007 benchmark datasets and compared STL with popular
dimension reduction algorithms. We report superior performance by using the
proposed STL based interactive video search reranking.

accretion, mergers and feedback. The currently favored cold dark matter
cosmological framework, suggests a hierarchical process of galaxy formation,
wherein the present properties of galaxies are decided by their individual
histories of being assembled from smaller pieces. However, recent studies have
uncovered surprising correlations among the properties of galaxies, to the
extent of forming a one-parameter set lying on a single fundamental line. It
has been argued in the literature that such simplicity is hard to explain
within the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy mergers. One of the puzzling
results, is the simple linear correlation between the neutral hydrogen mass and
the surface area, implying that widely different galaxies share very similar
neutral hydrogen surface densities. In this work we show that self-regulated
star formation, driven by the competition between gravitational instabilities
and mechanical feedback from supernovae, can explain the nearly constant
neutral hydrogen surface density across galaxies. We therefore recover the
simple scaling relation observed between the neutral hydrogen mass and surface
area. This result furthers our understanding of the surprising simplicity in
the observed properties of diverse galaxies.

below the electroweak scale: m_{DM}=5-100 GeV. In particular, we focus our
attention on the lower end of this mass range, as DM particles with masses
m_{DM} ~ 10 GeV have been recently claimed to be consistent with the CoGeNT and
DAMA/LIBRA results, while also providing viable DM candidates to explain the
measurements of Fermi and WMAP haze. (Aims) We study the model (in)dependence
of CMB spectrum on particle physics DM models, large scale structure formation
and cosmological uncertainties. We attempt to find a simple and practical
recipe for estimating current and future CMB bounds on a broad class of DM
annihilation models. (Results) We show that in the studied DM mass range the
CMB signal of DM annihilations is independent of the details of large scale
structure formation, distribution and profile of DM halos and other
cosmological uncertainties. All particle physics models of DM annihilation can
be described with only one parameter, the fraction of energy carried away by
neutrinos in DM annihilation. As the main result we provide a simple and rather
generic fitting formula for calculating CMB constraints on the annihilation
cross section of light WIMPs. We show that thermal relic DM in the CoGeNT, DAMA
favoured mass range is in a serious conflict with present CMB data for the
annihilation channels with few neutrinos, and will definitely be tested by the
Planck mission for all possible DM annihilation channels. Also, our findings
strongly disfavor the claim that thermal relic DM annihilations with m_{DM} ~

method to resample the large-scale (Gaussian-distributed) Fourier modes in a
periodic N-body simulation box in a manner that properly accounts for the
nonlinear mode-coupling between large and small scales. We find that our method
for adding new large-scale mode realizations recovers the nonlinear power
spectrum to sub-percent accuracy on scales larger than about half the Nyquist
frequency of the simulation box. Using 20 N-body simulations, we obtain a power
spectrum covariance matrix estimate that matches the estimator in Takahashi et
al. (2009) (from 5000 simulations) with < 20% errors in all matrix elements.
Comparing the rates of convergence, we determine that our algorithm requires ~
8 times fewer simulations to achieve a given error tolerance in estimates of
the power spectrum covariance matrix. The degree of success of our algorithm
indicates that we understand the main physical processes that give rise to the
correlations in the matter power spectrum. Namely, the large-scale Fourier
modes modulate both the degree of structure growth through the variation in the
effective local matter density and also the spatial frequency of small-scale
perturbations through large-scale displacements. We expect our algorithm to be
useful for noise modeling when constraining cosmological parameters from weak
lensing (cosmic shear) and galaxy surveys, rescaling summary statistics of
N-body simulations for new cosmological parameter values, and any applications
where the influence of Fourier modes larger than the simulation size must be

other neutral current channels, this is perhaps the only realistic way to
extract such information. This will be indispensable for understanding flavor

neutrino mixing from astrophysical uncertainties in a SN without adequate
spectral coverage of all flavors. We emphasize that scintillator detectors,

masses and annihilation cross sections. The present-day dark matter population
is typically asymmetric, but only weakly so, such that indirect signals of dark
matter annihilation are not completely suppressed. We apply our results to
existing models, noting that upcoming direct detection experiments will
constrain a large region of the relevant parameter space.

Abell 2744 (z = 0.308), one of the most actively merging galaxy clusters known.
It appears to have unleashed `dark', `ghost', `bullet' and `stripped'
substructures, each ~10^14 solar masses. The phenomenology is complex and will
present a challenge for numerical simulations to reproduce. With new, multiband
HST imaging, we identify 34 strongly-lensed images of 11 galaxies around the
massive Southern `core'. Combining this with weak lensing data from HST, VLT
and Subaru, we produce the most detailed mass map of this cluster to date. We
also perform an independent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray imaging. Our
analyses support a recent claim that the Southern core and Northwestern
substructure are post-merger and exhibit morphology similar to the Bullet
Cluster viewed from an angle. From the separation between X-ray emitting gas
and lensing mass in the Southern core, we derive a new and independent
constraint on the self-interaction cross section of dark matter particles
sigma/m <~ 3 \pm 1 cm^2 g^-1. In the Northwestern substructure, the gas, dark
matter, and galaxy components have become separated by much larger distances.
Most curiously, the `ghost' clump (primarily gas) leads the `dark' clump
(primarily dark matter) by more than 150 kpc. We propose an enhanced
`ram-pressure slingshot' scenario which may have yielded this reversal of
components with such a large separation, but needs further confirmation by
follow-up observations and numerical simulations. A secondary merger involves a
second `bullet' clump in the North and an extremely `stripped' clump to the
West. The latter appears to exhibit the largest separation between dark matter
and X-ray emitting baryons detected to date in our sky.

LRIS spectrograph on the Keck I 10-m telescope of three ultra-luminous X-ray
sources (ULXs), Ho IX X-1; M81 X-6; and Ho II X-1. Our observations reveal the
existence of large (100 - 200 pc diameter) highly-ionized nebulae, identified
by diffuse He II (4686 Angstrom) emission, surrounding these sources. Our
results are the first to find highly-ionized nebulae of this extent, and the
detection in all three objects indicates this may be a common feature of ULXs.
In addition to the extended emission, Ho IX X-1 has an unresolved central
component containing about one-third of the total He II flux, with a
significant velocity dispersion of ~ 370 km/s, suggestive of the existence of a
photo-ionized accretion disk or an extremely hot early-type stellar
counterpart. Most of the He II emission appears to be surrounded by
significantly more extended Hbeta emission, and the intensity ratios between
the two lines, which range from 0.12 - 0.33, indicate that photo-ionization is
the origin of the He II emission. Sustaining these extended nebulae requires
substantial X-ray emission, in the range ~ 10^{39} - 10^{40} ergs/s, comparable
to the measured X-ray luminosities of the sources. This favors models where the
X-ray emission is isotropic, rather than beamed, which includes the
interpretation that ULXs harbor intermediate-mass black holes.

distribution, given the ability to sample from a given distribution. The method
has been first formalized by von Neumann (1951) and has many applications in
classical computing. We define a quantum analogue of rejection sampling: given
a black box producing a coherent superposition of (possibly unknown) quantum
states with some amplitudes, the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition
of the same states, albeit with different target amplitudes. The main result of
this paper is a tight characterization of the query complexity of this quantum
state generation problem. We exhibit an algorithm, which we call quantum
rejection sampling, and analyze its cost using semidefinite programming. Our
proof of a matching lower bound is based on the automorphism principle which
allows to symmetrize any algorithm over the automorphism group of the problem.
Our main technical innovation is an extension of the automorphism principle to
continuous groups that arise for quantum state generation problems where the
oracle encodes unknown quantum states, instead of just classical data.
Furthermore, we illustrate how quantum rejection sampling may be used as a
primitive in designing quantum algorithms, by providing three different
applications. We first show that it was implicitly used in the quantum
algorithm for linear systems of equations by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd.
Secondly, we show that it can be used to speed up the main step in the quantum
Metropolis sampling algorithm by Temme et al.. Finally, we derive a new quantum
algorithm for the hidden shift problem of an arbitrary Boolean function and
relate its query complexity to ""water-filling"" of the Fourier spectrum.

evolve the equations of motion for an ensemble of more than 7 \times 10^7
realizations, drawing the coefficients in the scalar potential from statistical
distributions whose detailed properties have demonstrably small effects on our
results. When prolonged inflation occurs, it has a characteristic form: the
D3-brane initially moves rapidly in the angular directions, spirals down to an
inflection point in the potential, and settles into single-field inflation. The
probability of N_{e} e-folds of inflation is a power law, P(N_{e}) \propto
N_{e}^{-3}, and we derive the same exponent from a simple analytical model. The
success of inflation is relatively insensitive to the initial conditions: we
find attractor behavior in the angular directions, and the D3-brane can begin
far above the inflection point without overshooting. In favorable regions of
the parameter space, models yielding 60 e-folds of expansion arise
approximately once in 10^3 trials. Realizations that are effectively
single-field and give rise to a primordial spectrum of fluctuations consistent
with WMAP, for which at least 120 e-folds are required, arise approximately
once in 10^5 trials. The emergence of robust predictions from a six-field
potential with hundreds of terms invites an analytic approach to multifield
inflation.

algebras. It deals with classical and quantum dualities in a unified fashion
explaining the precise connection between quantum dualities and the low
temperature (strong-coupling)/high temperature (weak-coupling) dualities of
classical statistical mechanics (or (Euclidean) path integrals). Its range of
applications includes discrete lattice, continuum field, and gauge theories.
Dualities are revealed to be local, structure-preserving mappings between
model-specific bond algebras that can be implemented as unitary
transformations, or partial isometries if gauge symmetries are involved. This
characterization permits to search systematically for dualities and
self-dualities in quantum models of arbitrary system size, dimensionality and
complexity, and any classical model admitting a transfer matrix representation.
Dualities like exact dimensional reduction, emergent, and gauge-reducing
dualities that solve gauge constraints can be easily understood in terms of
mappings of bond algebras. As a new example, we show that the (\mathbb{Z}_2)
Higgs model is dual to the extended toric code model {\it in any number of
dimensions}. Non-local dual variables and Jordan-Wigner dictionaries are
derived from the local mappings of bond algebras. Our bond-algebraic approach
goes beyond the standard approach to classical dualities, and could help
resolve the long standing problem of obtaining duality transformations for
lattice non-Abelian models. As an illustration, we present new dualities in any
spatial dimension for the quantum Heisenberg model. Finally, we discuss various
applications including location of phase boundaries, spectral behavior and,
notably, we show how bond-algebraic dualities help constrain and realize
fermionization in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions.

  We also show that the characteristic polynomial can be computed from the

observed by Huh. In the case of free arrangements, we prove that this Chern
class agrees with the Chern class of the dual of a bundle of differential forms
with logarithmic poles along the hyperplanes in the arrangement; this follows
from work of Mustata and Schenck. We conjecture that this relation holds for
all free divisors.
  We give an explicit relation between the characteristic polynomial of an
arrangement and the Segre class of its singularity (`Jacobian') subscheme. This
gives a variant of a recent result of Wakefield and Yoshinaga, and shows that
the Segre class of the singularity subscheme of an arrangement together with
the degree of the arrangement determine the ranks of the cohomology of its

the temperature-density relation (usually parametrized as a power-law, $T
\propto \Delta^{\gamma - 1} $) of the inter-galactic medium (IGM) through the
flux probability distribution function (PDF) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest.
Using a simple order-of-magnitude calculation, we show that few percent-level
systematic errors in the placement of the quasar continuum due to e.g. a
uniform low-absorption Gunn-Peterson component, could lead to errors in
$\gamma$ of order unity. This is quantified further using a simple
semi-analytic model of the Lya forest flux PDF. We find that
under-(over-)estimates in the continuum level can lead to a lower (higher)
measured value of $\gamma$. Within current observational uncertainties,
continuum biases double the error in $\gamma$ from $\sigma_{\gamma} \approx
0.1$ to $\sigma_{\gamma} \approx 0.2$ within our model. We argue that steps
need to be taken to directly estimate the level of continuum bias in order to
make recent claims of an inverted \tdr\ more robust.

color-color diagrams (I([SII])/I(H{\alpha}) versus I([NII])/I(H{\alpha})) using
only a limited range of ionization parameters and stellar temperatures.
Previously established variations in the relative abundance of heavy elements
render uncertain the most common method of determining electron temperatures
for components of the Orion-Eridanus Bubble and the WIM based on only the
I([NII])/I(H{\alpha}) ratio, although we confirm that the lowest surface
brightness components of the WIM are on average of higher electron temperature.
The electron temperatures for a few high surface brightness WIM components
determined by direct methods are comparable to those of classical bright H II
regions. In contrast, the low surface brightness HII regions studied by the
Wisconsin H{\alpha} Mapper are of lower temperatures than the classical bright
HII regions.

of the CE, nor for an ejection. However, in some cases, stellar envelopes
undergo stationary mass outflows, which are likely to occur during the slow
spiral-in stage of the CE event. We propose the condition for such outflows, in
a manner similar to the currently standard $\alpha_{\rm
CE}\lambda$-prescription but with an addition of $P/\rho$ term in the energy
balance equation, accounting therefore for the enthalpy of the envelope rather
than merely the gas internal energy. This produces a significant correction,
which might help to dispense with an unphysically high value of energy
efficiency parameter during CE phase, currently required in the binary
population synthesis studies to make the production of low-mass X-ray binaries
(LMXBs) with a black hole companion to match the observations.

radio emission from the core was detected following the state transition from
the soft to the hard X-ray state. Its position to the south-east of all

events prior to 2010 February 26. No radio-emitting components were detected to
the south-east of the core at any epoch, suggesting that the receding jets were
Doppler-deboosted below our sensitivity limit. From the ratio of the brightness
of the detected components to the measured upper limits for the receding
ejecta, we constrain the jet speed to be greater than 0.66c and the inclination
angle to the line of sight to be less than 49 degrees. Assuming that the
initial ejection event occurred at the transition from the hard intermediate
state to the soft intermediate state, an initial period of ballistic motion
followed by a Sedov phase (i.e. self-similar adiabatic expansion) appears to
fit the motion of the ejecta better than a uniform deceleration model. The
accurate core location can provide a long time baseline for a future proper

As the confidence and influence ranges are distinct for each agent, the

poorly-understood complex dynamic behavior. In both models, we classify the
agents via their interconnection topology and, accordingly, compute the
equilibria of the system. Then, we define a positive invariant set centered at
each equilibrium opinion vector. We show that if a trajectory enters one such

genes are commonplace in higher eukaryotes. Interposed boundaries or insulators
are able to block these long distance regulatory interactions. The mechanistic
basis for insulator activity and how it relates to enhancer
action-at-a-distance remains unclear. Here we explore the idea that topological
loops could simultaneously account for regulatory interactions of distal
enhancers and the insulating activity of boundary elements. We show that while
loop formation is not in itself sufficient to explain action at a distance,
incorporating transient non-specific and moderate attractive interactions
between the chromatin fibers strongly enhances long-distance regulatory
interactions and is sufficient to generate a euchromatin-like state. Under
these same conditions, the subdivision of the loop into two topologically
independent loops by insulators inhibits inter-domain interactions. The
underlying cause of this effect is a suppression of crossings in the contact
map at intermediate distances. Thus our model simultaneously accounts for
regulatory interactions at a distance and the insulator activity of boundary
elements. This unified model of the regulatory roles of chromatin loops makes
several testable predictions that could be confronted with \emph{in vitro}
experiments, as well as genomic chromatin conformation capture and fluorescent
microscopic approaches.

heat transfer. Given the premise that the averaged nonequilibrium heat flux is
governed by an anomalous heat conductivity, energy diffusion scaling determines
a corresponding anomalous thermal conductivity scaling behaviour.

to support mutually recursive types in different ways. This paper proposes a

concatenates all subjects along the temporal dimension, and then performs an
independent component analysis (ICA) for estimating the common cortical
patterns of functional connectivity. There exist many other interesting
variations of this technique, as reviewed in [Calhoun et al. 2009 Neuroimage

functional connectivity occurring at all possible time lags. For this purpose,
brain activity is viewed as a function of space and time, which allows the use
of the relatively new techniques of functional data analysis [Ramsay &
Silverman 2005: Functional data analysis. New York: Springer]. In essence, our
method first vectorizes the data from each subject, which constitutes the
natural discrete representation of a function of several variables, followed by
concatenation of all subjects. The singular value decomposition (SVD), as well
as the ICA of this new matrix of dimension [rows=(NT*NV); columns=NS] will
reveal spatio-temporal patterns of connectivity. As a further example, in the
case of EEG neuroimaging, Xi of size NVxNW may represent spectral density for
electric neuronal activity at NW discrete frequencies from NV cortical voxels,
from the i-th EEG epoch. In this case our functional data analysis approach
would reveal coupling of brain regions at possibly different frequencies.

we proposed a Gaussianization transform to Gaussianize the non-Gaussian lensing
convergence field $\kappa$. It performs a local monotonic transformation
$\kappa\rightarrow y$ pixel by pixel to make the unsmoothed one-point
probability distribution function of the new variable $y$ Gaussian. We tested
whether the whole $y$ field is Gaussian against N-body simulations. (1) We
found that the proposed Gaussianization suppresses the non-Gaussianity by
orders of magnitude, in measures of the skewness, the kurtosis, the 5th- and
6th-order cumulants of the $y$ field smoothed over various angular scales
relative to that of the corresponding smoothed $\kappa$ field. The residual
non-Gaussianities are often consistent with zero within the statistical errors.
(2) The Gaussianization significantly suppresses the bispectrum. Furthermore,
the residual scatters around zero, depending on the configuration in the
Fourier space. (3) The Gaussianization works with even better performance for
the 2D fields of the matter density projected over $\sim 300 \mpch$ distance
interval centered at $z\in(0,2)$, which can be reconstructed from the weak
lensing tomography. (4) We identified imperfectness and complexities of the
proposed Gaussianization. We noticed weak residual non-Gaussianity in the $y$
field. We verified the widely used logarithmic transformation as a good
approximation to the Gaussianization transformation. However, we also found
noticeable deviations.

observed in four high mass dense cores (W43-MM1, IRAS 18264, IRAS 05358, and
IRAS 18162). Our goal is to put some constraints on the relative evolutionary
stage of these sources by comparing these observations with time-dependent
chemical modeling. We used the chemical model Nahoon, which computes the
gas-phase chemistry and gas-grain interactions of depletion and evaporation.
Mixing of the different chemical compositions shells in a 1D structure through
protostellar envelope has been included since observed lines suggest nonthermal
supersonic broadening. Observed radial profiles of the temperature and density
are used to compute the chemistry as a function of time. With our model, we
underproduce CS by several orders of magnitude compared to the other S-bearing
molecules, which seems to contradict observations, although some uncertainties
in the CS abundance observed at high temperature remain. The OCS/SO2, SO/SO2,
and H2S/SO2 abundance ratios could in theory be used to trace the age of these
massive protostars since they show a strong dependence with time, but the
sources are too close in age compared to the accuracy of chemical models and
observations. Our comparison between observations and modeling may, however,
indicate that W43-MM1 could be chemically younger than the three other sources.
Turbulent diffusivity through the protostellar envelopes has to be less
efficient than 2e14 cm2s-1. Otherwise, it would have smoothed out the abundance
profiles, and this would have been observed. The sulfur chemistry depends
strongly on the 1D physical conditions. In our case, no conclusion can be given
on the relative age of IRAS 18264, IRAS 18162 and IRAS 05358 except that they
are very close. W43-MM1 seems younger than the other sources.

unitary evolution in a noiseless environment and then take into account the
noise due to non dissipative decoherence. We exploit local quantum estimation
theory to assess and optimize the precision of estimation procedures based on
the measurement of qubit population, and to compare their performances with the
ultimate limit posed by quantum mechanics. In particular, we evaluate the
Fisher information (FI) for population measurement, maximize its value over the
possible qubit preparations and interaction times, and compare its behavior
with that of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We found that the FI for
population measurement is equal to the QFI, i.e., population measurement is
optimal, for a suitable initial preparation of the qubit and a predictable
interaction time. The same configuration also corresponds to the maximum of the

The biological interpretation is often complicated by the statistical
instability of the obtained gene lists with respect to sampling variations,
which may partly be due to the functional redundancy among genes, implying that
multiple genes can play exchangeable roles in the cell. In this paper we use
the concept of exchangeability of random variables to model this functional
redundancy and thereby account for the instability attributable to sampling
variations. We present a flexible framework to incorporate the exchangeability
into the representation of lists. The proposed framework supports
straightforward robust comparison between any two lists. It can also be used to
generate new, more stable gene rankings incorporating more information from the
experimental data. Using a microarray data set from lung cancer patients we
show that the proposed method provides more robust gene rankings than existing
methods with respect to sampling variations, without compromising the
biological significance.

2004dj, obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, spanning 106--1393 d after
explosion. MIR photometry plus optical/near-IR observations are also reported.
An early-time MIR excess is attributed to emission from non-silicate dust
formed within a cool dense shell (CDS). Most of the CDS dust condensed between
50 d and 165 d, reaching a mass of 0.3 x 10^{-5} Msun. Throughout the
observations much of the longer wavelength (>10 microns) part of the continuum
is explained as an IR echo from interstellar dust. The MIR excess strengthened
at later times. We show that this was due to thermal emission from warm,
non-silicate dust formed in the ejecta. Using optical/near-IR line-profiles and
the MIR continua, we show that the dust was distributed as a disk whose radius
appeared to be slowly shrinking. The disk radius may correspond to a grain
destruction zone caused by a reverse shock which also heated the dust. The
dust-disk lay nearly face-on, had high opacities in the optical/near-IR
regions, but remained optically thin in the MIR over much of the period
studied. Assuming a uniform dust density, the ejecta dust mass by 996 d was 0.5
+/- 0.1) x 10^{-4} Msun, and exceeded 10^{-4}Msun by 1393 d. For a dust density
rising toward the center the limit is higher. Nevertheless, this study suggests
that the amount of freshly-synthesized dust in the SN 2004dj ejecta is
consistent with that found from previous studies, and adds further weight to
the claim that such events could not have been major contributors to the cosmic
dust budget.

different states of matter in the sense that it occurs even in the absence of
interactions between particles. In Einstein's textbook picture of an ideal gas,
purely statistical arguments set an upper bound on the number of particles
occupying the excited states of the system, and condensation is driven by this
saturation of the quantum vapour. Dilute ultracold atomic gases are celebrated
as a realisation of Bose-Einstein condensation in close to its purely
statistical form. Here we scrutinise this point of view using an ultracold gas
of potassium (39K) atoms, in which the strength of interactions can be tuned
via a Feshbach scattering resonance. We first show that under typical
experi-mental conditions a partially condensed atomic gas strongly deviates
from the textbook concept of a saturated vapour. We then use measurements at a
range of interaction strengths and temperatures to extrapolate to the
non-interacting limit, and prove that in this limit the behaviour of a Bose gas
is consistent with the saturation picture. Finally, we provide evidence for the
universality of our observations through additional measurements with a
different atomic species, 87Rb. Our results suggest a new way of characterising

currents penetrate from the magnetosphere into high-latitude ionosphere where
they dissipate energy, form electrojets, and excite plasma instabilities in the
E-region ionosphere. These instabilities give rise to plasma turbulence which
induces non-linear currents and strong anomalous electron heating (AEH) as
observed by radars. These two effects can increase the global ionospheric

the companion paper applies this analysis to develop a model of anomalous
conductivity and frictional heating useful in large-scale simulations and
models of the geospace environment. Employing first principles, this paper
proves for the general case an earlier conjecture that the source of energy for
plasma turbulence and anomalous heating equals the work by external field on
the non-linear current. Using a two-fluid model of an arbitrarily magnetized
plasma and the quasilinear approximation, this paper describes the energy
conversion process, calculates the partial sources of anomalous heating, and
reconciles the apparent contradiction between the inherently 2-D non-linear

Based on the theory of non-linear currents developed in the companion paper,
this paper derives the correction factors describing turbulent conductivities

where the allowance value reflects the level of uncovered pollution (demand),
the level of unused allowances (supply), and the technological status. These

Magellanic Cloud (SMC). A previous X-ray study of this SNR found a hard X-ray
source near its centre. Using all available archival and proprietary XMM-Newton
data, alongside new multi-frequency radio-continuum surveys and optical
observations at H-alpha and forbidden [SII] and [OIII] lines, we aim to
constrain the properties of the SNR and discover the nature of the hard source
within. Methods: We combine XMM-Newton datasets to produce the highest quality
X-ray image of IKT 16 to date. We use this, in combination with radio and
optical images, to conduct a multi-wavelength morphological analysis of the
remnant. We extract separate spectra from the SNR and the bright source near
its centre, and conduct spectral fitting of both regions. Results: We find IKT
16 to have a radius of 37+-3 pc, with the bright source located 8+-2 pc from
the centre. This is the largest known SNR in the SMC. The large size of the
remnant suggests it is likely in the Sedov-adiabatic phase of evolution. Using
a Sedov model to fit the SNR spectrum, we find an electron temperature kT of
1.03+-0.12 keV and an age of 14700 yr. The absorption found requires the
remnant to be located deep within the SMC. The bright source is fit with a
power law with index 1.58+-0.07, and is associated with diffuse radio emission
extending towards the centre of the SNR. We argue that this source is likely to
be the neutron star remnant of the supernova explosion, and infer its
transverse kick velocity to be 580+-100 km/s. The X-ray and radio properties of
this source strongly favour a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) origin.

to a model with spin-up and spin-down electrons constituting different fluids,
but where the spin-velocity correlations are omitted. Three wave interaction of
2 shear Alfven waves and a compressional Alfven wave is then taken as a model
problem to evaluate the asserted equivalence. The theoretical argument turns
out to be supported, as the predictions of the two models agree completely.
Furthermore, the three wave coupling coefficients obey the Manley-Rowe
relations, which give further support to the soundness of the models and the
validity of the assumptions made in the derivation. Finally we point out that
the proposed two-fluid model can be incorporated in standard Particle-In-Cell

Versatile Advection Code (AMRVAC) coupled to a linear radiative transfer code

a mode-locking mechanism in which mass (or velocity) asymmetry is identified as
the key ingredient to stabilize such states. While the scenario is valid both

densities commensurate with the lattice spacing are also mentioned. These ideas
are illustrated and confronted with the physics of the asymmetric

densities such that a trimer phase can be stabilized. Phase diagrams are
computed using density-matrix renormalization group techniques, showing the
important role of the total density in achieving the novel phase. The effective
physics of the trimer gas is as well studied. Lastly, the effect of a parabolic
confinement and the emergence of a crystal phase of trimers are briefly
addressed. This model has connections with the physics of imbalanced

quark-gluon plasma possess different (quasi-) bound states, between which
transitions are possible. In particular, we show that the time-evolution
eigenstates in the medium are mixtures of the vacuum eigenstates. This leads to
abundance ratios of quarkonia that differ from those predicted in statistical
models or in the sequential-melting picture.

Powder X-ray diffraction confirmed all samples R3Ni2B2N3 with R = La, Ce, Pr,
Nd and their solid solutions to crystallize in the body centered tetragonal
La3Ni2B2N3 structure type. Superconducting and magnetic properties of
La(3-x)R(x)Ni2B2N3 were studied by resistivity, specific heat and
susceptibility measurements. While La3Ni2B2N3 has a superconducting transition
temperature Tc ~ 14 K, substitution of La by Ce, Pr, and Nd leads to magnetic
pair breaking and, thus, to a gradual suppression of superconductivity.
Pr3Ni2B2N3 exibits no long range magnetic order down to 2 K, Nd3Ni2B2N3 shows
ferrimagnetic ordering below T_C = 17 K and a spin reorientation transition to
a nearly antiferromagnetic state at 10 K.

Wu","Two-band model of Raman scattering on iron pnictide superconductors","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on a two-band model, we study the electronic Raman scattering intensity
in both normal and superconducting states of iron-pnictide superconductors. For
the normal state, due to the match or mismatch of the symmetries between band
hybridization and Raman vertex, it is predicted that overall $B_{1g}$ Raman
intensity should be much weaker than that of the $B_{2g}$ channel. Moreover, in
the non-resonant regime, there should exhibit a interband excitation peak at
frequency $\omega\simeq 7.3 t_1 (6.8t_1)$ in the $B_{1g}$ ($B_{2g}$) channel.
For the superconducting state, it is shown that $\beta$-band contributes most
to the $B_{2g}$ Raman intensity as a result of multiple effects of Raman
vertex, gap symmetry, and Fermi surface topology. Both extended $s$- and
$d_{xy}$-wave pairings in the unfolded BZ can give a good description to the
reported $B_{2g}$ Raman data [Muschler {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. B. {\bf 80},
180510 (2009).], while $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing in the unfolded BZ seems to
be ruled out.

exciton energy distribution in coupled quantum wells [S. Yang \textit{et al.},

interactions in indirect excitons. Based on the uncertainty principle, along
with a temperature and energy dependent distribution which includes both
population and recombination effects, we show that the interplay between an
attractive two-body interaction and a repulsive three-body interaction can lead
to a natural and good account for the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of
the average exciton energy. Moreover, exciton energy maxima are shown to locate
at the brightest regions, in agreement with the recent experiments. Our results
provide an alternative way for understanding the underlying physics of the
exciton dynamics in coupled quantum wells.
