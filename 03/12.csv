$b$ are single particle states) have been used for predicting violations of
local realism (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger violations) and are valuable in
metrology for precision measurements of phase at the Heisenberg limit. We show
theoretically how the use of two Fock state Bose-Einstein condensates as
sources in a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer can lead to the creation of
the NOON state in which $a$ and $b$ refer to arms of the interferometer and $N$
is a subset of the total number of particles in the two condensates. The
modification of the interferometer involves making {}""side"" measurements of a
few particles near the sources. These measurements put the remaining particles
in a superposition of two phase states, which are converted into NOON states by
a beam splitter if the phase states are orthogonal. When they are not
orthogonal, a {}""feedforward"" correction circuit is shown to convert them into
proper form so a NOON results. We apply the NOON to the measurement of phase.
Here the NOON experiment is equivalent to one in which a large molecule passes
through two slits. The NOON components can be recombined in a final beam
splitter to show interference.

have recently been noted in the outskirts of expanding star clusters in
numerical simulations. Energetically soft, with semi-major axes exceeding the
initial size of their birth cluster, it is puzzling how these binaries are
created and preserved. We provide an interpretation of the formation of these
binaries that explains the total number formed and their distribution of
energies. A population of weakly bound binaries can always be found in the
cluster, in accordance with statistical detailed balance, limited at the soft
end only by the current size of the cluster and whatever observational criteria
are imposed. At any given time, the observed soft binary distribution is
predominantly a snapshot of a transient population. However, there is a
constantly growing population of long-lived soft binaries that are removed from
the detailed balance cycle due to the changing density and velocity dispersion
of an expanding cluster. The total number of wide binaries that form, and their
energy distribution, are insensitive to the cluster population; the number is
approximately one per cluster. This suggests that a population composed of many
dissolved small-N clusters will more efficiently populate the field with wide
binaries than that composed of dissolved large-N clusters. Locally such
binaries are present at approximately the 2% level; thus the production rate is
consistent with the field being populated by clusters with a median of a few
hundred stars rather than a few thousand.

natural mechanism to form turbulent cold clouds as precursors to molecular
clouds. Yet because of the large density and temperature differences and the
range of dynamical scales involved, following this process with numerical
simulations is challenging. We compare two-dimensional simulations of
flow-driven cloud formation without self-gravity, using the Lagrangian Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code VINE and the Eulerian grid code Proteus.
Results are qualitatively similar for both methods, yet the variable spatial
resolution of the SPH method leads to smaller fragments and thinner filaments,
rendering the overall morphologies different. Thermal and hydro-dynamical
instabilities lead to rapid cooling and fragmentation into cold clumps with
temperatures below 300K. For clumps more massive than 1 Msun/pc, the clump mass
function has an average slope of -0.8. The internal velocity dispersion of the
clumps is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than their relative motion,
rendering it subsonic with respect to the internal sound speed of the clumps,
but supersonic as seen by an external observer. For the SPH simulations most of
the cold gas resides at temperatures below 100K, while the grid-based models
show an additional, substantial component between 100 and 300K. Independently
of the numerical method our models confirm that converging flows of warm
neutral gas fragment rapidly and form high-density, low-temperature clumps as
possible seeds for star formation.

degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals on a triangular lattice which unifies intrinsic
frustration of spin and orbital interactions with geometrical frustration.
Using full or Lanczos exact diagonalization of finite clusters we establish
that the ground state of the spin-orbital model which interpolates between the
superexchange and direct exchange interactions on the bonds is characterized by
valence-bond correlations. In the absence of Hund's exchange the model
describes a competition between various possible valence-bond states. By
considering the clusters with open boundary conditions we demonstrate that
orbital interactions are always frustrated, but this frustration is removed by
pronounced spin singlet correlations which coexist with supporting them dimer
orbital correlations. Such local configurations contribute to the disordered
ground states found for the clusters with periodic boundary conditions which
interpolate between a highly resonating, dimer-based, entangled spin-orbital
liquid phase, and a valence-bond state with completely static spin-singlet
states. We argue that these states are also realized for the infinite lattice
and anticipate that pronounced transitions between different regimes found for
particular geometries will turn out to smooth crossovers in the properties of
the spin-orbital liquid in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we provide
evidence that the resonating spin-orbital liquid phase involves entangled
states on the bonds. In such a phase classical considerations based on the
mean-field theory cannot be used, spin exchange interactions do not determine
spin bond correlations, and quantum fluctuations play a crucial role in the
ground states and magnetic transitions.

While this effect may be important for certain properties, we find that, with
regard to superconductivity, electron-electron correlations still generically

tend to be more impulsive in the soft X-ray time profiles and show more slender
shapes in the EIT 195 A images, while the eruptive ones are of long-duration
events and show much more extended brightening regions. The location of the
confined flares are closer to the center of the AR, while the eruptive flares
are at the outskirts. This difference is quantified by the displacement
parameter, the distance between the AR center and the flare location: the
average displacement of the six confined flares is 16 Mm, while that of
eruptive ones is as large as 39 Mm. Further, through nonlinear force-free field
extrapolation, we find that the decay index of the transverse magnetic field in

the eruptive flare sites is weaker than that over the confined ones. These

low-luminosity host galaxy of the super-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernova SN
2007if. Deep imaging of the host reveals its apparent magnitude to be
$m_g=23.15\pm0.06$, which at the spectroscopically-measured redshift of
$z_{helio}=0.07450\pm0.00015$ corresponds to an absolute magnitude of
$M_g=-14.45\pm0.06$. Galaxy $g-r$ color constrains the mass-to-light ratio,
giving a host stellar mass estimate of $\log(M_*/M_\odot)=7.32\pm0.17$. Balmer
absorption in the stellar continuum, along with the strength of the 4000\AA\
break, constrain the age of the dominant starburst in the galaxy to be
$t_\mathrm{burst}=123^{+165}_{-77}$ Myr, corresponding to a main-sequence
turn-off mass of $M/M_\odot=4.6^{+2.6}_{-1.4}$. Using the R$_{23}$ method of
calculating metallicity from the fluxes of strong emission lines, we determine
the host oxygen abundance to be $12+\log(O/H)_\mathrm{KK04}=8.01\pm0.09$,
significantly lower than any previously reported spectroscopically-measured
Type Ia supernova host galaxy metallicity. Our data show that SN 2007if is very
likely to have originated from a young, metal-poor progenitor.

twist fields in the two-dimensional massive Dirac theory. Primary U(1) twist
fields correspond to exponential fields in the sine-Gordon model at the
free-fermion point, and it is well-known that their vacuum two-point functions
are determined by integrable differential equations. We extend part of this
result to more general quantum states (pure or mixed) and to certain
descendents, showing that some two-point functions are determined by the
sinh-Gordon differential equations whenever there is translation and parity
invariance, and the density matrix is the exponential of a bilinear expression
in fermions. We use methods involving Ward identities associated to the
copy-rotation symmetry in a model with two independent, anti-commuting copies.
Such methods were used in the context of the thermally perturbed Ising quantum
field theory model. We show that they are applicable to the Dirac theory as
well, and we suggest that they are likely to have a much wider applicability to
free fermion models in general. Finally, we note that our form-factor study of
descendents twist fields combined with a CFT analysis provides a new way of
evaluating vacuum expectation values of primary U(1) twist fields: by deriving
and solving a recursion relation.

It has been shown that
this problem can be solved by adding an ultra low-power processor to execute
simple, frequent sensor data processing. While very effective in saving energy,
this resulting heterogeneous, distributed architecture poses a significant
challenge to application development.
  We present Reflex, a suite of runtime and compilation techniques to conceal
the heterogeneous, distributed nature from developers. The Reflex automatically
transforms the developer's code for distributed execution with the help of the
Reflex runtime. To create a unified system illusion, Reflex features a novel
software distributed shared memory (DSM) design that leverages the extreme
architectural asymmetry between the low-power processor and the powerful
central processor to achieve both energy efficiency and performance.
  We report a complete realization of Reflex for heterogeneous smartphones with
Maemo/Linux as the central kernel. Using a tri-processor hardware prototype and
sensing applications reported in recent literature, we evaluate the Reflex
realization for programming transparency, energy efficiency, and performance.
We show that Reflex supports a programming style that is very close to
contemporary smartphone programming. It allows existing sensing applications to
be ported with minor source code changes. Reflex reduces the system power in
sensing by up to 83%, and its runtime system only consumes 10% local memory on
a typical ultra-low power processor.

the first Mopra (ATNF) maps of the CHaMP survey region (300{\deg}>l>280{\deg})

of moment maps of the HCO+ J=1-0 emission from the ensemble of 301 massive
molecular clumps. From these maps we also derive the physical parameters of the

analysis yields the following range of properties: integrated line intensity
1-30 K km s-1, peak line brightness 1-7 K, linewidth 1-10 km s-1, integrated
line luminosity 0.5-200 K km s-1 pc^2, FWHM size 0.2-2.5 pc, mean projected

treatment of image fragments of different transition frequency. MIR method is
based on piecewise-constant image approximation on a non-uniform orthogonal
grid constructed by the following recurrent multigrid algorithm. A sequence of
nested uniform grids is built, such that each cell of a current grid is
subdivided into four smaller cells for the next grid designing. In each grid
the cells are selected, where the color intensity function can be approximated
by its average value with a given precision (thereafter 'good' cells). After
replacing colors of good cells by their approximating constants the
reconstructed image looks like a mosaic composed of one-colored cells.
Multigrid algorithm results in the stratification of the image space into
regions of different transition frequency. Sizes of these regions depend on the
few tuning precision parameters that characterizes adaptability of the method
to the image fragments of different non-homogeneity degree. The method is found
efficient for prominent contour (skeleton) extraction, edge detection as well

correlations between certain properties of those systems and a set of
macroscopically distinct states of the corresponding measurement devices. A
natural question of fundamental significance is how much information a quantum
detector can extract from the quantum system it is applied to. In the present
paper we address this question within a precise framework: given a quantum
detector implementing a specific generalized quantum measurement, what is the
optimal performance achievable with it for a concrete information readout task,
and what is the optimal way to encode information in the quantum system in
order to achieve this performance? We consider some of the most common
information transmission tasks - the Bayes cost problem (of which minimal error
discrimination is a special case), unambiguous message discrimination, and the
maximal mutual information. We provide general solutions to the Bayesian and
unambiguous discrimination problems. We also show that the maximal mutual
information has an interpretation of a capacity of the measurement, and derive
various properties that it satisfies, including its relation to the accessible
information of an ensemble of states, and its form in the case of a
group-covariant measurement. We illustrate our results with the example of a
noisy two-level symmetric informationally complete measurement, for whose
capacity we give analytical proofs of optimality. The framework presented here
provides a natural way to characterize generalized quantum measurements in

mechanical objects by use of an optomechanical interferometer. Two optical
cavities, each coupled to a separate mechanical oscillator, are coherently
driven such that the oscillators are laser cooled to the quantum regime. The
entanglement is induced by optical measurement and comes about by combining the
output from the two cavities to erase which-path information. It can be
verified through measurements of degrees of second-order coherence of the

optomechanical coupling. Realistic parameters for the membrane-in-the-middle

orbital characteristics of this extraordinary binary, and alternative binary
models are unable to explain the observables. We present a triple-star model
for producing MSPs in relatively wide eccentric binaries with a normal
(main-sequence) stellar companion. We start from a stable triple system
consisting of a Low-Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) with an orbital period of at least
1 day, accompanied by a G-dwarf in a wide and possibly eccentric orbit.
Variations in the initial conditions naturally provide a satisfactory
explanation for the unexplained triple component in the eclipsing soft X-ray
transient 4U~2129+47 or the cataclysmic variable EC 19314-5915. The best
explanation for J1903, however, results from the expansion of the orbit of the
LMXB, driven by the mass transfer from the evolving donor star to its neutron
star companion, which causes the triple eventually to becomes dynamically
unstable. Using numerical computations we show that, depending on the precise
system configuration at the moment the triple becomes dynamically unstable, the
ejection of each of the three components is possible. If the donor star of the
LMXB is ejected, a system resembling J1903, will result. If the neutron star is
ejected, a single MSP results. This model therefore also provides a
straightforward mechanism for forming single MSP in the Galactic disk. We
conclude that the Galaxy contains some 30--300 binaries with characteristics
similar to J1903, and about an order of magnitude fewer single millisecond
pulsars produced with the proposed triple scenario.

""irrelevant to life,"" disconnected from sensory-motor experience. Neural
mechanisms of these processes are suggested as well as their mathematical

vacuum gap in quantities that are several orders of magnitude greater then the
heat transfer by far-field, blackbody radiation. Although heat transfer via
near-field effects has been discussed for many years, experimental verification
of this theory has been very limited. We have measured the heat transfer
between two macroscopic sapphire plates, finding an increase in agreement with
expectations from theory. These experiments, conducted near 300 K, have
measured the heat transfer as a function of separation over mm to $\mu$m and as
a function of temperature differences between 2.5 and 30 K. The experiments
demonstrate that evanescence can be put to work to transfer heat from an object

proportion of unexpressed genes have pre-assembled RNA pol II transcription
initiation complex stably bound to their promoters. Some such promoter
proximally paused genes are regulated at transcription elongation rather than
at initiation; it has been proposed that this difference allows these genes to
both express faster and achieve more synchronous expression across populations
of cells, thus overcoming molecular ""noise"" arising from low copy number
factors. It has been established experimentally that genes which are regulated
at elongation tend to express faster and more synchronously; however, it has
not been shown directly whether or not it is the change in the regulated step
{\em per se} that causes this increase in speed and synchrony. We investigate
this question by proposing and analyzing a continuous-time Markov chain model
of polymerase complex assembly regulated at one of two steps: initial
polymerase association with DNA, or release from a paused, transcribing state.
Our analysis demonstrates that, over a wide range of physical parameters,
increased speed and synchrony are functional consequences of elongation
control. Further, we make new predictions about the effect of elongation
regulation on the consistent control of total transcript number between cells,
and identify which elements in the transcription induction pathway are most
sensitive to molecular noise and thus may be most evolutionarily constrained.

simulation of Ising model in presence of external magnetic fields, and showed
almost arbitrary control in generating non-trivial Ising coupling patterns.
Here we use laser-cooled trapped 171-Yb+ ions to simulate the emergence of
magnetism in a system of interacting spins by implementing a fully-connected
non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model in a transverse magnetic field. To link
this quantum simulation to condensed matter physics, we measure scalable
correlation functions and order parameters appropriate for the description of
larger systems, such as various moments of the magnetization. By increasing the
Ising coupling strengths compared with the external field, the crossover from
paramagnetism to ferromagnetic order sharpens as the system is scaled up from N
= 2 to 9 trapped ion spins. This points toward the onset of a quantum phase
transition that should become infinitely sharp as the system approaches the
macroscopic scale. We compare the measured ground state order to theory, which
may become intractable for non-uniform Ising couplings as the number of spins
grows beyond 20- 30 and even NP complete for a fully-connected frustrated Ising
model, making this experiment an important benchmark for large-scale quantum

vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is very important problem with wide range of
implications including safety related and congestion avoidance applications. We
discuss several limitations of existing misbehavior detection schemes (MDS)
designed for VANETs. Most MDS are concerned with detection of malicious nodes.
In most situations, vehicles would send wrong information because of selfish
reasons of their owners, e.g. for gaining access to a particular lane. Because
of this (\emph{rational behavior}), it is more important to detect false
information than to identify misbehaving nodes. We introduce the concept of
data-centric misbehavior detection and propose algorithms which detect false
alert messages and misbehaving nodes by observing their actions after sending
out the alert messages. With the data-centric MDS, each node can independently
decide whether an information received is correct or false. The decision is
based on the consistency of recent messages and new alert with reported and
estimated vehicle positions. No voting or majority decisions is needed, making
our MDS resilient to Sybil attacks. Instead of revoking all the secret
credentials of misbehaving nodes, as done in most schemes, we impose fines on
misbehaving nodes (administered by the certification authority), discouraging
them to act selfishly. This reduces the computation and communication costs
involved in revoking all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes.

cluster of commodity servers in a single datacenter. It features key-based
range partitioning, 3-way replication, and a transactional get-put API with the
option to choose either strong or timeline consistency on reads. This paper
describes Spinnaker's Paxos-based replication protocol. The use of Paxos
ensures that a data partition in Spinnaker will be available for reads and
writes as long a majority of its replicas are alive. Unlike traditional
master-slave replication, this is true regardless of the failure sequence that
occurs. We show that Paxos replication can be competitive with alternatives
that provide weaker consistency guarantees. Compared to an eventually
consistent datastore, we show that Spinnaker can be as fast or even faster on
reads and only 5% to 10% slower on writes.

fields with spin 0, 1 and 1/2 on a geometric thick brane generated by pure 4D
and 5D positive cosmological constants without bulk scalar fields. This model
possesses a 4D cosmological constant that can be made as small as one desires
without fine-tuning it with the bulk cosmological constant. The RS model is
obtained as an analytic continuation of the flat brane limit of this braneworld
configuration when the Hubble parameter disappears. Within this inflating
braneworld model it is possible to formulate a mechanism for obtaining TeV mass
scales from Planck ones by adding a positive thin brane, where the Standard
Model fields are trapped, at a distance y_2 from the origin, where the Planck
thick brane resides. The brane separation must be of the same order than the
inverse thickness parameter of the model in order for the mechanism to generate
the desired hierarchy. This result is obtained by imposing the recovery of both
the correct 4D gravitational couplings and the actually observed accelerated
expansion of the universe in our de Sitter braneworld. Regarding the
localization of matter in the purely geometric thick braneworld, for spin 0
massless and massive scalar fields as well as for spin 1 vector fields, the
potentials of the Kaluza--Klein (KK) modes in thecorresponding Schroedinger
equations are modified Poeschl-Teller potentials, which lead to the
localization of the scalar and vector zero modes on the brane as well as to
mass gaps in the mass spectra. We also compute the corrections to Coulomb's law
coming from massive KK vector modes. For spin 1/2 fermions, we introduce the
bulk mass term MF(z)\bar{\Psi}\Psi in the action and show that localization of
the massless left-chiral fermion zero mode is feasible for two mass functions
MF(z) with a finite/infinite number of massive KK bound states.

between them, what is the fraction of matched points over infinitely long
streams? In many application contexts, e.g., secure networking, a meaningful
matching rule is that of a maximum causal delay, and the problem is related to
embedding a flow of packets in cover traffic such that no traffic analysis can
detect it. We study the best undetectable embedding policy and the
corresponding maximum flow rate ---that we call the embedding capacity--- under
the assumption that the cover traffic can be modeled as arbitrary renewal
processes. We find that computing the embedding capacity requires the inversion
of very structured linear systems that, for a broad range of renewal models
encountered in practice, admits a fully analytical expression in terms of the
renewal function of the processes. Our main theoretical contribution is a
simple closed form of such relationship. This result enables us to explore
properties of the embedding capacity, obtaining closed-form solutions for
selected distribution families and a suite of sufficient conditions on the
capacity ordering. We evaluate our solution on real network traces, which shows
a noticeable match for tight delay constraints. A gap between the predicted and
the actual embedding capacities appears for looser constraints, and further
investigation reveals that it is caused by inaccuracy of the renewal traffic
model rather than of the solution itself.

theory in terms of the famous complex Ernst potentials, a pair of functions
which allows one to generate new exact solutions from known ones by means of
the so-called nonlinear hidden symmetries of Lie-Backlund type. This formalism
turned out to be very useful to perform a complete classification of all 4D
solutions which present two spacetime symmetries or possess two Killing
vectors. Curiously enough, the Ernst formalism can be extended and applied to
stationary General Relativity as well as the effective heterotic string theory
reduced down to three spatial dimensions by means of a (real) matrix
generalization of the Ernst potentials. Thus, in this theory one can also make
use of nonlinear matrix hidden symmetries in order to generate new exact
solutions from seed ones. Due to the explicit independence of the matrix Ernst
potential formalism of the original theory (prior to dimensional reduction) on
the dimension D, in the case when the theory initially has D>=5, one can
generate new solutions like charged black holes, black rings and black Saturns,
among others, starting from uncharged field configurations.

e.g., two ""non-interfering"" mechanisms, one can determine $|\eta_i|^2$ and
$|\eta_j|^2$, $\eta_i$ and $\eta_j$ being the two fundamental parameters
characterising these mechanisms, from data on the half-lives of two nuclear

$\betabeta$-decay, $|\eta_i|^2$ and $|\eta_j|^2$ and the interference term can
be uniquely determined, in principle, from data on the half-lives of three

$|\eta_i|^2\geq 0$ and $|\eta_j|^2\geq 0$ lead to stringent constraints on the

considered by us can be generalised to the case of more than two

significant concequences for the theory of high-frequency quasiperiodic

several commonly used orbital models of 3:2 HF QPOs. We show that the estimate
of a>0.9 is almost inconsistent with two hot-spot (relativistic precession and
tidal disruption) models and the warped disc resonance model. In contrast, we
demonstrate that the epicyclic resonance and discoseismic models assuming the
c- and g- modes are favoured. We extend our discussion to another two
microquasars that display the 3:2 HF QPOs. The frequencies of these QPOs scale
roughly inversely to the microquasar masses, and the differences in the
individual spins, such as a=0.9 compared to a=0.7, represent a generic problem
for most of the discussed geodesic 3:2 QPO models. To explain the observations
of all the three microquasars by one unique mechanism, the models would have to
accommodate very large non-geodesic corrections.

conditions of finite element exterior calculus can be used for the horizontal
discretisation of dynamical cores for numerical weather prediction on
pseudo-uniform grids. This family of mixed finite element methods can be
thought of in the numerical weather prediction context as a generalisation of
the popular polygonal C-grid finite difference methods. There are a few major
advantages: the mixed finite element methods do not require an orthogonal grid,
and they allow a degree of flexibility that can be exploited to ensure an
appropriate ratio between the velocity and pressure degrees of freedom so as to
avoid spurious mode branches in the numerical dispersion relation. These
methods preserve several properties of the C-grid method when applied to linear
barotropic wave propagation, namely: a) energy conservation, b) mass
conservation, c) no spurious pressure modes, and d) steady geostrophic modes on
the $f$-plane. We explain how these properties are preserved, and describe two
examples that can be used on pseudo-uniform grids: the recently-developed
modified RT0-Q0 element pair on quadrilaterals and the BDFM1-\pdg element pair
on triangles. All of these mixed finite element methods have an exact 2:1 ratio
of velocity degrees of freedom to pressure degrees of freedom. Finally we
illustrate the properties with some numerical examples.

corollary that the unordered configuration space B_n(M) satisfies classical
homological stability: for each i, H_i(B_n(M); Q) is isomorphic to
H_i(B_{n+1}(M); Q) for n > i. This improves on results of McDuff, Segal, and
others for open manifolds. Applied to closed manifolds, this provides natural
examples where rational homological stability holds even though integral
homological stability fails.
  To prove the main theorem, we introduce the notion of monotonicity for a
sequence of S_n--representations, which is of independent interest.
Monotonicity provides a new mechanism for proving representation stability
using spectral sequences. The key technical point in the main theorem is that
certain sequences of induced representations are monotone.

state of CeRu2Si2 are reported. They demonstrate that the relative change of
effective mass through the pseudo metamagnetic transition is invariant under
pressure. The results are compared with the first order metamagnetic transition
due to the antiferromagnetism of Ce0.9La0.1Ru2Si2 which corresponds to the
""negative"" pressure of CeRu2Si2 by volume expansion. Finally, we describe the
link between the spin-depairing of quasiparticles on CeRu2Si2 and that of
Cooper pairs on the unconventional heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn5.

Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal system to synthesize certain attractors. Results show
numerically, via computer graphic simulations, that the obtained synthesized
attractor belongs to the class of all admissible attractors for the
Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal system and matches the averaged attractor obtained with
the control parameter replaced with the averaged switched parameter values.
This feature allows us to imagine that living beings are able to maintain vital
behavior while the control parameter switches so that their dynamical behavior
is suitable for the given environment.

partially crossed with similar regions originating from other non reactor

catalog of the AKARI Mid-infrared(MIR) All-Sky Survey. Our MIR search has an
advantage in detecting AGNs that are obscured at optical wavelengths due to
extinction. We first selected AKARI 9micron excess sources with
F(9micron)/F(K_S)>2 where K_S magnitudes were taken from the Two Micron All Sky
Survey. We then obtained follow-up near-infrared spectroscopy with the
AKARI/IRC, to confirm that the excess is caused by hot dust. We also obtained
optical spectroscopy with the Kast Double Spectrograph on the Shane 3-m
telescope at Lick Observatory. On the basis of on these observations, we
detected hot dust with a characteristic temperature of ~500K in two luminous
infrared galaxies. The hot dust is suspected to be associated with AGNs that
exhibit their nonstellar activity not in the optical, but in the near- and
mid-infrared bands, i.e., they harbor buried AGNs. The host galaxy stellar
masses of 4-6 x 10^9 M_sun are small compared with the hosts in
optically-selected AGN populations. These objects were missed by previous
surveys, demonstrating the power of the AKARI MIR All-Sky Survey to widen AGN
searches to include more heavily obscured objects. The existence of multiple
dusty star clusters with massive stars cannot be completely ruled out with our
current data.

non-standard kinetic terms (of the k-essence type) onto a Schwarzschild black
hole are performed. We find a full dynamical solution for the spherical
accretion of a Dirac-Born-Infeld type scalar field. The simulations show that
the accretion eventually settles down to a well known stationary solution. This
particular analytical steady state solution maintains two separate horizons.
The standard horizon is for the usual particles propagating with the limiting
speed of light, while the other sonic horizon is for the k-essence
perturbations propagating with the speed of sound around this accreting
background. For the case where the k-essence perturbations propagate
superluminally, we show that one can send signals from within a black hole
during the approach to the stationary solution. We also find that a ghost
condensate model settles down to a stationary solution during the accretion
process.

with a nonnegative input constraint, also known as the intensity-modulated
direct detection channel, with and without confining them to a lattice
structure. Our optimization criteria are the average electrical and optical
power. The nonnegativity input signal constraint is translated into a conical
constraint in signal space, and modulation formats are designed by sphere
packing inside this cone. Some remarkably dense packings are found, which yield
more power-efficient modulation formats than previously known. For example, at
a spectral efficiency of 1 bit/s/Hz, the obtained modulation format offers a
0.86 dB average electrical power gain and 0.43 dB average optical power gain
over the previously best known modulation formats to achieve a symbol error
rate of 10^-6. This modulation turns out to have a lattice-based structure. At
a spectral efficiency of 3/2 bits/s/Hz and to achieve a symbol error rate of
10^-6, the modulation format obtained for optimizing the average electrical
power offers a 0.58 dB average electrical power gain over the best
lattice-based modulation and 2.55 dB gain over the best previously known
format. However, the modulation format optimized for average optical power
offers a 0.46 dB average optical power gain over the best lattice-based
modulation and 1.35 dB gain over the best previously known format.
