environment with a global shared memory and p cores, each having a cache of
size M, and with data organized in blocks of size B. We characterize the class
of `Hierarchical Balanced Parallel (HBP)' multithreaded computations for
multicores. HBP computations are similar to the hierarchical divide & conquer
algorithms considered in recent work, but have some additional features that
guarantee good performance even when accounting for the cache misses due to
false sharing. Most of our HBP algorithms are derived from known
cache-oblivious algorithms with high parallelism, however we incorporate new
techniques that reduce the effect of false-sharing.
  Our approach to addressing false sharing costs (or more generally, block
misses) is to ensure that any task that can be stolen shares O(1) blocks with
other tasks. We use a gapping technique for computations that have larger than
O(1) block sharing. We also incorporate the property of limited access writes
analyzed in a companion paper, and we bound the cost of accessing shared blocks
on the execution stacks of tasks.
  We present the Priority Work Stealing (PWS) scheduler, and we establish that,
given a sufficiently `tall' cache, PWS deterministically schedules several
highly parallel HBP algorithms, including those for scans, matrix computations
and FFT, with cache misses bounded by the sequential complexity, when
accounting for both traditional cache misses and for false sharing. We also
present a list ranking algorithm with almost optimal bounds. PWS schedules
without using cache or block size information, and uses knowledge of processors
only to the extent of determining the available locations from which tasks may
be stolen; thus it schedules resource-obliviously.

near-orthogonal columns of the solution can be reformulated as the posterior
probability of corresponding node belonging to each community. Therefore, the

that their asymmetric profiles could be explained by maser emission arising

properties extracted from STM studies of cuprate superconductors in order to

method introduced here may be extended to a variety of surface probes, enabling
the direct measurement of the dimension of the phenomenon being studied, in

motivation of each pedestrian is to leave the facility. The events used to
redirect pedestrians include the identification of a jam situation and/or
identification of a better route than the current. This study considers two
types of pedestrians: familiar and unfamiliar with the facility. Four
strategies are modelled to cover those groups. The modelled strategies are the
shortest path (local and global); They are combined with a quickest path
approach, which is based on an observation principle. In the quickest path
approach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment
and are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit
analysis function. The dynamic modelling of route choice with different
strategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of in uences which
appears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an
evacuation process. To address this question criteria are elaborated. The
criteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time, the
individual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution and the overall jam size
itself. The in uences of the different strategies on those evaluation criteria
are investigated. The sensibility of the system to disturbances (e.g. broken

made up of the hopping term, the Kane-Mele and Rashba spin-orbit couplings as
well as the Haldane orbital term. We find that the variation of the exchange
field results in bulk gap-closing phenomena and phase transitions occur in the
graphene system. If the Haldane orbital coupling is absent, the phase
transition between the chiral (anti-chiral) edge state $\nu=+2$ ($\nu=-2$) and
the pseudo-quantum spin Hall state ($\nu=0$) takes place. Surprisingly, when
the Haldane orbital coupling is taken into account, an intermediate QSH phase
with two additional edge modes appears in between phases $\nu=+2$ and $\nu=-2$.
This intermediate phase is therefore either the hyper-chiral edge state of high
Chern number $\nu=+4$ or anti-hyper-chiral edge state of $\nu=-4$ when the
direction of exchange field is reversed. We present the band structures, edge
state wave functions and current distributions of the different QAH phases in
the system. We also report the critical exchange field values for the QAH phase
transitions.

(seven to date) of X-ray dim and radio-silent middle-aged isolated neutron
stars (a.k.a. XDINSs), which are characterised by pure blackbody spectra
(kT~40-100 eV), long X-ray pulsations (P=3-12 s), and appear to be endowed with
relatively high magnetic fields, (B~10d13-14 G). RBS 1774 is one of the few
XDINSs with a candidate optical counterpart, which we discovered with the VLT.
We performed deep observations of RBS 1774 in the R band with the VLT to
disentangle a non-thermal power-law spectrum from a Rayleigh-Jeans, whose
contributions are expected to be very much different in the red part of the
spectrum. We did not detect the RBS 1774 candidate counterpart down to a 3
sigma limiting magnitude of R~27. The constraint on its colour, (B-R)<0.6,
rules out that it is a background object, positionally coincident with the
X-ray source. Our R-band upper limit is consistent with the extrapolation of
the B-band flux (assuming a 3 sigma uncertainty) for a set of power-laws F_nu
~nu^alpha with spectral indeces alpha<0.07. If the optical spectrum of RBS 1774
were non-thermal, its power-law slope would be very much unlike those of all
isolated neutron stars with non-thermal optical emission, suggesting that it is
most likely thermal. For instance, a Rayleigh-Jeans with temperature T_O = 11
eV, for an optically emitting radius r_O=15 km and a source distance d=150 pc,
would be consistent with the optical measurements. The implied low distance is
compatible with the 0.04 X-ray pulsed fraction if either the star spin axis is
nearly aligned with the magnetic axis or with the line of sight, or it is
slightly misaligned with respect to both the magnetic axis and the line of
sight by 5-10 degrees

chaotic behavior as the fluctuations are not small. Integrability implies the
existence of a regular foliation of the phase space by invariant manifolds. Our

anisotropy is called the ""tensor passive mode."" Because these fluctuations
deviate largely from the Gaussian statistics due to the quadratic dependence on

production from $10^{14}$GeV to $10^3$GeV. Here, $B_{1 {\rm Mpc}}$ is the
strength of the primordial magnetic field smoothed on $1 {\rm Mpc}$. From the
above estimation and the current observational constraint on the primordial
non-Gaussianity, we get a rough constraint on the magnetic field strength as
$B_{1 {\rm Mpc}} < 2.6 - 4.4 {\rm nG}$.

evaluate the partition function of the O(3) ferromagnet up to three loops.
Dyson, in his pioneering microscopic analysis of the Heisenberg model, showed
that the spin-wave interaction starts manifesting itself in the low-temperature
expansion of the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet only at
order $T^4$. Although several authors tried to go beyond Dyson's result, to the
best of our knowledge, a fully systematic and rigorous investigation of higher
order terms induced by the spin-wave interaction, has never been achieved. As
we demonstrate in the present paper, it is straightforward to evaluate the
partition function of an ideal ferromagnet beyond Dyson's analysis, using
effective Lagrangian techniques. In particular, we show that the
next-to-leading contribution to the spontaneous magnetization resulting from
the spin-wave interaction already sets in at order $T^{9/2}$ -- in contrast to
all claims that have appeared before in the literature. Remarkably, the
corresponding coefficient is completely determined by the leading-order
effective Lagrangian and is thus independent of the anisotropies of the cubic
lattice. We also consider even higher-order corrections and thereby solve --
once and for all -- the question of how the spin-wave interaction in an ideal
ferromagnet manifests itself in the spontaneous magnetization beyond the Dyson
term.

  Critical Points",,,"10.1063/1.3613669",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine the relationship between
water-like anomalies and the liquid-liquid critical point in a family of model
fluids with multi-Gaussian, core-softened pair interactions. The core-softened
pair interactions have two length scales, such that the longer length scale
associated with a shallow, attractive well is kept constant while the shorter
length scale associated with the repulsive shoulder is varied from an inflexion
point to a minimum of progressively increasing depth.
  As the shoulder well depth increases, the pressure required to form the high
density liquid decreases and the temperature up to which the high-density
liquid is stable increases, resulting in the shift of the liquid-liquid
critical point to much lower pressures and higher temperatures. The pair
correlation entropy is computed to show that the excess entropy anomaly
diminishes when the shoulder well depth increases. Excess entropy scaling of
diffusivity in this class of fluids is demonstrated, showing that decreasing
strength of the excess entropy anomaly with increasing shoulder depth results
in the progressive loss of water-like thermodynamic, structural and transport
anomalies. Instantaneous normal mode analysis was used to index the overall
curvature distribution of the fluid and the fraction of imaginary frequency
modes was shown to correlate well with the anomalous behaviour of the
diffusivity and the pair correlation entropy. The results suggest in the case
of core-softened potentials, in addition to the presence of two length scales,
energetic and entropic effects associated with local minima and curvatures of
the pair interaction play an important role in determining the presence of
water-like anomalies and the liquid-liquid phase transition.

the in-medium effective kaon-nucleon cross sections. The effective cross

spectroscopic redshifts in the range of 3.8<z<5.0, over the Great Observatories
Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields. Among 74 galaxies detected in the Spitzer
IRAC 3.6 and 4.5um bands, more than 70% of the galaxies show clear excess at
3.6um compared to the expected flux density from stellar continuum only. We
provide evidence that this 3.6um excess is due to Halpha emission redshifted
into the 3.6um band, and classify these 3.6um excess galaxies to be Halpha
emitter (HAE) candidates. The selection of HAE candidates using an excess in
broad-band filters is sensitive to objects whose rest-frame H$\alpha$
equivalent width is larger than 350A, star formation rates of 20-500 Msun/yr.
The Halpha-to-UV luminosity ratio of HAEs is on average larger than that of
local starbursts. Possible reasons for such strong Halpha emission in these
galaxies include different dust extinction properties, young stellar population
age, continuous star formation history, low metallicity, and top-heavy stellar
initial mass function. Although the correlation between UV slope beta and
L(Ha)/L(UV) raises the possibility that HAEs prefer a dust extinction curve
which is steeper in the UV, the most dominant factor that results in strong
Halpha emission appears to be star formation history. The Halpha equivalent
widths of HAEs are large despite their relatively old stellar population ages
constrained by SED fitting, suggesting that at least 60% of HAEs produce stars
at a constant rate. Under the assumption that the cold gas supply is sustained,
HAEs are able to produce ~50% of the observed stellar mass density at z~3 that
is caught in massive (M*>10^11 Msun) galaxies. This 'strong Halpha phase' of
star formation plays a dominant role in early galaxy growth, being a feasible
progenitors of massive red galaxies at lower redshifts.

numerous applications. They have been the subject of extensive investigation
during the last decades. Roughly speaking, they are a certain decomposition of
a given space into cells, induced by a distance function and by a tuple of
subsets called the generators or the sites. Consider the following question:
does a small change of the sites, e.g., of their position or shape, yield a
small change in the corresponding Voronoi cells? This question is by all means
natural and fundamental, since in practice one approximates the sites either
because of inexact information about them, because of inevitable numerical
errors in their representation, for simplification purposes and so on, and it
is important to know whether the resulting Voronoi cells approximate the real
ones well. The traditional approach to Voronoi diagrams, and, in particular, to
(variants of) this question, is combinatorial. However, it seems that there has
been a very limited discussion in the geometric sense (the shape of the cells),
mainly an intuitive one, without proofs, in Euclidean spaces. We formalize this
question precisely, and then show that the answer is positive in the case of
R^d, or, more generally, in (possibly infinite dimensional) uniformly convex
normed spaces, assuming there is a common positive lower bound on the distance
between the sites. Explicit bounds are given, and we allow infinitely many
sites of a general form. The relevance of this result is illustrated using
several pictures and many real-world and theoretical examples and
counterexamples.

for an extra (sterile) neutrino, but early dark energy and barotropic dark
energy also contribute to the relativistic degrees of freedom. We examine the
capabilities of current and future data to constrain and discriminate between
these explanations, and to detect the early dark energy density associated with

constraints on N_{eff}, a dark radiation component, such as that provided by
barotropic dark energy models, can substantially change current constraints on
N_{eff}, bringing its value back to agreement with the theoretical prediction.
Both dark energy models also have implications for the primordial mass fraction

that the bobber decay channel may be observed in standard production channels

parameter space consistent with a neutralino dark matter relic density,
analyzing its dependence on the non-standard Higgs boson, slepton and squark
masses, as well as on the condition of gaugino mass unification. In general, we

TeV gamma-ray telescopes also observed many SNRs and discovered many

  supercooled water film driven by gravity and wind drag","31 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A theoretical model is proposed to explain the roughness characteristics of
an ice surface grown from a gravity and wind-driven supercooled water film
flowing over an inclined plane. The effects of the water supply rate, plane
slope and air stream velocity on the spacing and height of ice surface
roughness are investigated from a new type of morphological instability of the
ice-water interface. The proposed macro-scale morphological instability under a
supercooled water film is quite different from the micro-scale one which
results in dendritic growth. It was found that ice surface roughness spacing
depends mainly on water layer thickness, and that surface roughness height is
very sensitive to the convective heat transfer rate at the water-air interface.
The present model takes into account the interaction between air and water
flows through the boundary conditions at the water-air interface. This leads us
to a major finding that tangential and normal shear stress disturbances due to
airflow at the water-air interface play a crucial role not only on the
convective heat transfer rate at the disturbed water-air interface but also on
the height of the ice surface roughness. This is confirmed by comparison of the
amplification rate of the ice-water interface disturbance predicted by the
model with the roughness height observed experimentally.

randomized work stealing (RWS) in a parallel environment, taking into account
the effects of false sharing.
  First, prior analyses (due to Acar et al.) are extended to incorporate false
sharing. However, to control the possible delays due to false sharing, some
restrictions on the algorithms seem necessary. Accordingly, the class of
Hierarchical Tree algorithms is introduced and their performance analyzed.
  In addition, the paper analyzes the performance of a subclass of the
Hierarchical Tree Algorithms, called HBP algorithms, when scheduled using RWS;
improved complexity bounds are obtained for this subclass. This class was
introduced in a companion paper with efficient resource oblivious computation
in mind.
  Finally, we note that in a scenario in which there is no false sharing the
results in this paper match prior bounds for cache misses but with reduced
assumptions, and in particular with no need for a bounding concave function for
the cost of cache misses as in prior work by Frigo and Strumpen. This allows
non-trivial cache miss bounds in this case to be obtained for a larger class of
algorithms.

nearby (< 10 Mpc) spiral galaxies using a differential pixel-based analysis of
the ionized gas emission. We explore this as an alternative approach for
connecting large-scale dynamical mechanisms with star formation processes in
disk galaxies, based on burst ages derived from the Ha to far UV (FUV) flux
ratio. Images of each galaxy in Ha were taken with Taurus Tunable Filter (TTF)
and matched to FUV imaging from GALEX. The resulting flux ratio provides a
robust measure of relative age across the disk which we discuss in terms of the
large-scale dynamical motions. Systematic effects, such as a variable initial
mass function (IMF), non-solar metallicities, variable star-formation history
(SFHs), and dust attenuation, have been used to derive estimates of the
systematic uncertainty.
  The resulting age maps show a wide range of patterns outside of those
galaxies with the strongest spiral structure, confirming the idea that star
formation is driven one by several processes, largely determined by the
individual circumstances of the galaxy. Generally, grand design spirals such as
M74, M100, and M51 exhibit age gradients across the main spiral arms, with the
youngest star formation regions along the central and inner edges. In M63 and
M74 galaxy-wide trends emerge, suggesting that although most star formation is
located along spiral arms, spiral density waves are not the only driver in
these cases. We argue that despite appearances, galaxy morphology is not an
absolute discriminator of the star formation history of an individual galaxy,
nor of the processes triggering it. We conclude that Ha-to-FUV flux ratios are
a relatively direct way to probe burst ages across galaxies and infer something
of their dynamical histories, provided that sources of systematics are properly
taken into account.

polarization with a simple analytical model, only a small number of 585 strong
sources have significant polarizations at these wavelengths. The median
depolarization ratio from 1.4 GHz for the strongest sources is <0.2,
reinforcing the likelihood that radio galaxies are found in magnetized
environments, even outside of rich clusters. Seven sources with significant 350
MHz polarization were selected for a more in-depth Faraday structure analysis.
We fit the observed values Q/I and U/I as a function of lambda^2 using both a
depolarizing screen and two component models. We also performed RM
Synthesis/Clean and standard fitting of polarization angle vs. lambda^2. We
find that a single rotation measure (RM), as found using polarization angle
fitting or simple screen models, commonly provides a poor fit when the
solutions are translated back into Q, U space. Thus, although a single
""characteristic"" rotation measure may be found using these techniques, the
Faraday structure of the source may not be adequately represented. We also
demonstrate that RM Synthesis may yield an erroneous Faraday structure in the
presence of multiple, interfering RM components, even when cleaning of the
Faraday spectrum is performed. We briefly explore the conditions under which
rotation measures and Faraday structure results can be reliable. Many
measurements in the literature do not meet these criteria; we discuss how these

oscillator, is typically identified with the transition from a quantum
superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states, such as the
Schr\""odinger cat state, into the corresponding statistical mixture. This
transition is commonly characterized by the asymptotic loss of the interference
term in the Wigner representation of the cat state. In this paper we show that
the quantum to classical transition has different dynamical features depending
on the measure for nonclassicality used. Measures based on an operatorial
definition have well defined physical meaning and allow a deeper understanding
of the quantum to classical transition. Our analysis shows that, for most
nonclassicality measures, the Schr\""odinger cat dies after a finite time.
Moreover, our results challenge the prevailing idea that more macroscopic
states are more susceptible to decoherence in the sense that the transition
from quantum to classical occurs faster. Since nonclassicality is prerequisite
for entanglement generation our results also bridge the gap between
decoherence, which appears to be only asymptotic, and entanglement, which may
show a sudden death. In fact, whereas the loss of coherences still remains
asymptotic, we have shown that the transition from quantum to classical can
indeed occur at a finite time.

inputs are the SDSS central blue and red Galaxy Stellar Mass Functions reported
in Yang et al. 2009, and the measured local gas mass-Ms relations for blue and
red galaxies. For the Halo Mass Function associated to central blue galaxies,
the distinct LCDM one is used and set up to exclude: (i) the observed
group/cluster mass function (blue galaxies are rare as centers of
groups/clusters), and (ii) halos with a central major merger at resdshifts
z<0.8 (dry late major mergers destroy the disks of blue galaxies). For red
galaxies, we take the complement of this function to the total. The obtained
mean Ms-Mh and Mb-Mh relations of central blue and red galaxies do not differ
significantly from the respective relations for all central galaxies. For
Mh>10^11.5 Msun, the Ms's of red galaxies tend to be higher than those of blue
ones for a given Mh, the difference not being larger than 1.7. For Mh<10^11.5
Msun, this trend is inverted. For blue (red) galaxies: (a) the maximum value of

the low-mass end while at the high-mass end, fs\propto Mh^-0.4 (fs\propto

maximum values of fb=0.028^{+0.018}_{-0.011} and fb=0.034^{+0.025}_{-0.014},

polarization due to axisymmetric magnetic fields in rotating stars. We use the
Hanle effect to predict variations in net line polarization, and use geometric
arguments to generalize these results to linear polarization due to other
mechanisms. Methods: Building on the work of Lopez Ariste et al., we use simple
analytic models of rotating stars that are symmetric except for an axisymmetric
magnetic field to predict the polarization lightcurve due to the Hanle effect.
We highlight the effects for the variable line polarization as a function of
viewing inclination and field axis obliquity. Finally, we use geometric
arguments to generalize our results to linear polarization from the weak
transverse Zeeman effect. Results: We derive analytic expressions to
demonstrate that the variable polarization lightcurve for an oblique magnetic
rotator is symmetric. This holds for any axisymmetric field distribution and
arbitrary viewing inclination to the rotation axis. Conclusions: For the
situation under consideration, the amplitude of the polarization variation is
set by the Hanle effect, but the shape of the variation in polarization with
phase depends largely on geometrical projection effects. Our work generalizes
the applicability of results described in Lopez Ariste et al., inasmuch as the
assumptions of a spherical star and an axisymmetric field are true, and
provides a strategy for separating the effects of perspective from the Hanle

of voids in the sample volume is 62%. The largest void is just over 30 h^{-1}
Mpc in effective radius. The median effective radius is 17 h^{-1} Mpc. The
voids are found to be significantly underdense, with density contrast \delta <
-0.85 at the edges of the voids. The radial density profiles of these voids are
similar to predictions of dynamically distinct underdensities in gravitational
theory. We find 8,046 galaxies brighter than M_r = -20.09 within the voids,
accounting for 7% of the galaxies. We compare the results of VoidFinder on SDSS
DR7 to mock catalogs generated from a SPH halo model simulation as well as
other \Lambda -CDM simulations and find similar void fractions and void sizes
in the data and simulations. This catalog is made publicly available at

supersymmetric spectrum are a light stop and gluino, with both sparticles much
lighter than all the additional squarks. This unique mass hierarchy leads to
the enhanced production of events with an ultra-high multiplicity of hadronic
jets which should be clearly visible to the \sqrt{s} = 7 TeV LHC at only 1
inverse fb of integrated luminosity. We suggest a modest alternative event
cutting procedure based around a reduced minimal transverse momentum per jet

per subscribed event. These criteria optimize the F-SU(5) signal to background
ratio, while readily suppressing the contribution of all Standard Model
processes, allowing moreover a clear differentiation from competing models of
new physics, most notably minimal supergravity. The characteristic No-Scale
signature is quite stable across the viable parameter space, modulo an overall
rescaling of the mass spectrum; Detection by the LHC of the ultra-high jet

naturally gives rise to correlation functions possessing full conformal
invariance. This is due to the mathematical isomorphism between the conformal
group of certain 3 dimensional slices of de Sitter space and the de Sitter
isometry group SO(4,1). In the standard homogeneous isotropic cosmological
model in which primordial density perturbations are generated during a long
vacuum energy dominated de Sitter phase, the embedding of flat spatial sections
in de Sitter space induces a conformal invariant perturbation spectrum and
definite prediction for the shape of the non-Gaussian CMB bispectrum. In the
case in which the density fluctuations are generated instead on the de Sitter
horizon, conformal invariance of the horizon embedding implies a different but
also quite definite prediction for the angular correlations of CMB
non-Gaussianity on the sky. Each of these forms for the bispectrum is intrinsic
to the symmetries of de Sitter space and in that sense, independent of specific
model assumptions. Each is different from the predictions of single field slow
roll inflation models which rely on the breaking of de Sitter invariance. We
propose a quantum origin for the CMB fluctuations in the scalar gravitational
sector from the conformal anomaly that could give rise to these
non-Gaussianities without a slow roll inflaton field, and argue that conformal
invariance also leads to the expectation for the relation n_S-1=n_T between the
spectral indices of the scalar and tensor power spectrum. Confirmation of this
prediction or detection of non-Gaussian correlations in the CMB of one of the
bispectral shape functions predicted by conformal invariance can be used both
to establish the physical origins of primordial density fluctuations and
distinguish between different dynamical models of cosmological vacuum dark
energy.

incorrect. Because of an insidious software error, what we reported as Stokes V

that is also significantly offset from the Stokes I feature, but at a velocity
that differs slightly from the absorption feature in fractional polarization.

with differing (1) ratios of H I column density to spin temperature, (2)

position angle with frequency implies incomplete coverage of the background jet

Analytical Processing (OLAP). The applications in this area are designed to
make the analysis of shared multidimensional information fast [9]. On one hand,
speed can be achieved by specially devised data structures and algorithms. On
the other hand, the analytical process is cyclic. In other words, the user of
the OLAP application runs his or her queries one after the other. The output of
the last query may be there (at least partly) in one of the previous results.
Therefore caching also plays an important role in the operation of these
systems. However, caching itself may not be enough to ensure acceptable
performance. Size does matter: The more memory is available, the more we gain
by loading and keeping information in there. Oftentimes, the cache size is
fixed. This limits the performance of the multidimensional database, as well,
unless we compress the data in order to move a greater proportion of them into
the memory. Caching combined with proper compression methods promise further
performance improvements. In this paper, we investigate how caching influences
the speed of OLAP systems. Different physical representations (multidimensional
and table) are evaluated. For the thorough comparison, models are proposed. We
draw conclusions based on these models, and the conclusions are verified with

where the maximal flavor group is gauged and anomaly cancellation is guaranteed
by adding new vectorlike fermion states. We address the question of the lowest
allowed flavor symmetry scale consistent with data. Because of the mechanism
recently pointed out by Grinstein et al. tree-level flavor changing neutral
currents turn out to play a very weak constraining role. The same occurs, in
our model, for electroweak precision observables. The main constraint turns out
to come from WR-mediated flavor changing neutral current box diagrams,
primarily K - Kbar mixing. In the case where discrete parity symmetry is
present at the TeV scale, this constraint implies lower bounds on the mass of
vectorlike fermions and flavor bosons of 5 and 10 TeV respectively. However,
these limits are weakened under the condition that only SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} is
restored at the TeV scale, but not parity. For example, assuming the SU(2)
gauge couplings in the ratio gR/gL approx 0.7 allows the above limits to go
down by half for both vectorlike fermions and flavor bosons. Our model provides
a framework for accommodating neutrino masses and, in the parity symmetric
case, provides a solution to the strong CP problem. The bound on the lepton
flavor gauging scale is somewhat stronger, because of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
constraints. We argue, however, that the applicability of these constraints
depends on the mechanism at work for the generation of neutrino masses.

channel with unlimited lookahead, introduced by El Gamal, Hassanpour, and
Mammen. Unlike the standard relay channel model, where the relay encodes its
signal based on the previous received output symbols, the relay in the
noncausal relay channel encodes its signal as a function of the entire received
sequence. In the existing coding schemes, the relay uses this noncausal
information solely to recover the transmitted message and then cooperates with
the sender to communicate this message to the receiver. However, it is shown in
this paper that by applying the Gelfand--Pinsker coding scheme, the relay can
take further advantage of the noncausally available information, which can
achieve strictly higher rates than existing coding schemes. This paper also
provides a new upper bound on the capacity of the noncausal relay that strictly
improves upon the cutset bound. These new lower and upper bounds on the

Current radial-velocity surveys, achieving precisions of 1 m/s, are able to
detect terrestrial-mass planets and provide meaningful estimates of their
occurrence rate. We present an analysis of 67 solar-type stars from the
Anglo-Australian Planet Search specifically targeted for very high-precision
observations. When corrected for incompleteness, we find that the planet
occurrence rate increases sharply with decreasing planetary mass. Our results
are consistent with those from other surveys: in periods shorter than 50 days,
we find that 1.5% of stars host a giant (m_p > 100M_earth) planet, and that
18.5% of stars host a planet with m_p < 10M_earth. The preponderance of
low-mass planets in short-period orbits is in conflict with formation
simulations in which the majority of terrestrial-mass planets reside at larger
orbital distances. This work gives a hint as to the size of eta-Earth, but to
make meaningful predictions on the frequency of terrestrial planets in longer,
potentially habitable orbits, low-mass terrestrial planet searches at periods
of 100-200 days must be made an urgent priority for ground-based Doppler planet
searches in the years ahead.

A and B sites of the graphene bipartite lattice, the nanomesh made mostly of
zigzag (armchair) type edges exhibit antiferromagnetic (spin unpolarized)
states. In contrast, in situation of sublattice symmetry breaking, stable
ferri(o)magnetic states are obtained. For hydrogen-passivated nanomesh, the
formation energy is dramatically decreased, and ground state is found to
strongly depend on the vacancies shape and size. For triangular shaped holes,
the obtained net magnetic moments increase with the number difference of
removed A and B sites in agreement with Lieb's theorem for even A+B. For odd
A+B triangular meshes and all cases of non-triangular nanomeshes including the
one with even A+B, Lieb's theorem does not hold anymore which can be partially
attributed to introduction of armchair edges. In addition, large triangular
shaped GNM could be as robust as non-triangular GNMs, providing possible
solution to overcome one of crucial challenges for the sp-magnetism. Finally,
significant exchange splitting values as large as $\sim 0.5$ eV can be obtained
for highly asymmetric structures evidencing the potential of GNM for room
temperature carbon based spintronics. These results demonstrate that a turn
from 0-dimensional graphene nanoflakes throughout 1-dimensional graphene
nanoribbons with zigzag edges to GNM breaks localization of unpaired electrons

in a matching market setup by a seller, the market maker. Taking the standard
market equilibrium approach, upon receiving submitted bid vectors from the
buyers, the market maker will decide on a price vector to clear the market in
such a way that each buyer is allocated an item for which he desires the most
(a.k.a., a market equilibrium solution). While such equilibrium outcomes are
not unique, the market maker chooses one (maxeq) that optimizes its own
objective --- revenue maximization. The buyers in turn change bids to their
best interests in order to obtain higher utilities in the next round's market
equilibrium solution.
  This is an (n+1)-person game where buyers place strategic bids to gain the
most from the market maker's equilibrium mechanism. The incentives of buyers in
deciding their bids and the market maker's choice of using the maxeq mechanism
create a wave of Nash dynamics involved in the market. We characterize Nash
equilibria in the dynamics in terms of the relationship between maxeq and mineq
(i.e., minimum revenue equilibrium), and develop convergence results for Nash
dynamics from the maxeq policy to a mineq solution, resulting an outcome
equivalent to the truthful VCG mechanism.

limitations on overshoot, undershoot, maximum amplitude and fluctuation

for example, the minimum possible overshoot attainable by all possible
stabilizing controllers is an optimization task that cannot be expressed as a

clusters, each isolated cluster being treated exactly, with inter-cluster
hopping being treated approximately. The theory allows for the possibility of a
different superfluid order parameter at every site in the lattice, such as what
has been used in previously published site-decoupled mean-field theories, but a
multi-site formulation also allows for the inclusion of spatial correlations
allowing us, e.g., to calculate the correlation length (over the length scale
of each cluster). We present our numerical results for a two-dimensional
system. This theory is shown to produce a phase diagram in which the stability
of the Mott insulator phase is larger than that predicted by site-decoupled
single-site mean-field theory. Two different methods are given for the
identification of the Bose glass-to-superfluid transition, one an approximation
based on the behaviour of the condensate fraction, and one of which relies on
obtaining the spatial variation of the order parameter correlation. The

  Multi-Cell Cooperation","5 pages",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-cell cooperation is a promising approach for mitigating inter-cell
interference in dense cellular networks. Quantifying the performance of
multi-cell cooperation is challenging as it integrates physical-layer
techniques and network topologies. For tractability, existing work typically
relies on the over-simplified Wyner-type models. In this paper, we propose a
new stochastic-geometry model for a cellular network with multi-cell
cooperation, which accounts for practical factors including the irregular
locations of base stations (BSs) and the resultant path-losses. In particular,
the proposed network-topology model has three key features: i) the cells are
modeled using a Poisson random tessellation generated by Poisson distributed
BSs, ii) multi-antenna BSs are clustered using a hexagonal lattice and BSs in
the same cluster mitigate mutual interference by spatial interference
avoidance, iii) BSs near cluster edges access a different sub-channel from that
by other BSs, shielding cluster-edge mobiles from strong interference. Using
this model and assuming sparse scattering, we analyze the shapes of the outage
probabilities of mobiles served by cluster-interior BSs as the average number
$K$ of BSs per cluster increases. The outage probability of a mobile near a
cluster center is shown to be proportional to $e^{-c(2-\sqrt{\nu})^2K}$ where
$\nu$ is the fraction of BSs lying in the interior of clusters and $c$ is a
constant. Moreover, the outage probability of a typical mobile is proved to
scale proportionally with $e^{-c' (1-\sqrt{\nu})^2K}$ where $c'$ is a constant.

to a transport-fragmentation equation: each individual grows with a given
transport rate, and splits into two offsprings of the same size, following a
binary fragmentation process with unknown division rate that depends on its
size. In contrast to a deterministic inverse problem approach, as in (Perthame,
Zubelli, 2007) and (Doumic, Perthame, Zubelli, 2009), we take in this paper the
perspective of statistical inference: our data consists in a large sample of
the size of individuals, when the evolution of the system is close to its
time-asymptotic behavior, so that it can be related to the eigenproblem of the
considered transport-fragmentation equation (see \cite{PR} for instance). By
estimating statistically each term of the eigenvalue problem and by suitably
inverting a certain linear operator (see previously quoted articles), we are
able to construct a more realistic estimator of the division rate that achieves
the same optimal error bound as in related deterministic inverse problems. Our
procedure relies on kernel methods with automatic bandwidth selection. It is
inspired by model selection and recent results of Goldenschluger and Lepski.

Hilbert space, the evolution under the influence of a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian
is much more restricted. This restriction is caused by the fragmentation of the
spectrum into a high-energy part with doubly degenerate levels and a
nondegenerate low-energy part. This degeneracy suppresses transitions to states
of the high-energy part of the spectrum. At a moderate interaction strength
this effect supports strongly the dynamical formation of a N00N state. The N00N

in the equatorial plane, and the velocity field is obtained. The $\alpha$

previous popular analytical models. However, an inflow region and an outflow
region always exist, except when the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is too large,
which supports the results of some recent numerical simulation works. Our
results indicate that the outflows should be common in various accretion disks

and evolution of retarded electromagnetic fields as well as the influence of
the magnetic and electric fields on the quasiparticle propagation. The
time-space structure of the fields is analyzed in detail for non-central Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV. It is shown that the created magnetic
field is highly inhomogeneous but in the central region of the overlapping
nuclei it changes relatively weakly in the transverse direction. For the impact
parameter $b=$10 fm the maximal magnetic field - perpendicularly to the
reaction plane - is obtained of order $eB_y/m_\pi^2\sim$5 for a very short time
$\sim$ 0.2 fm/c, which roughly corresponds to the time of a maximal overlap of
the colliding nuclei. We find that at any time the location of the maximum in
the $eB_y$ distribution correlates with that of the energy density of the
created particles. In contrast, the electric field distribution, being also
highly inhomogeneous, has a minimum in the center of the overlap region.
Furthermore, the field characteristics are presented as a function of the
collision energy and the centrality of the collisions. To explore the effect of
the back reaction of the fields on hadronic observables a comparison of HSD
results with and without fields is exemplified. Our actual calculations show no
noticeable influence of the electromagnetic fields - created in heavy-ion
collisions - on the effect of the electric charge separation with respect to
the reaction plane.

studied by solving the corresponding Bloch equation and it is shown that at

high scale corresponding to the experimentally estimated axion decay constant
$f_{\chi}$. The symmetry breaking mechanism is discussed in analogy with PCAC
in pion physics. $S$-duality invariant interactions of fermions with axion and
dilaton doublet are introduced. The symmetry breaking mechanism contributes
negligibly small corrections to fermion masses in the QCD sector. Inspired by

Flare bursts with a periodicity of approximately 60 s are also detected. These

on the site on which Fe-occupancy was changed. Based on the calculated $\Delta
E$ - values, the average formation energy, $<\Delta E>$, was determined as a
weighted over probabilities of different atomic configurations. The latter has
a minimum in the concentration range where the $\sigma$-phase exists. The

a simple E^-2 neutrino flux at neutrino telescopes, at the example of
time-integrated point source searches using IceCube-40 data. We use a
self-consistent model for the neutrino production, in which protons interact
with synchrotron photons from co-accelerated electrons, and we fully take into
account the relevant pion and kaon production modes, the flavor composition at
the source, flavor mixing, and magnetic field effects on the secondaries
(pions, muon, and kaons). Since some of the model parameters can be related to
the Hillas parameters R (size of the acceleration region) and B (magnetic
field), we relate the detector response to the Hillas plane. In order to
compare the response to different spectral shapes, we use the energy flux
density as a measure for the pion production efficiency times luminosity of the
source. We demonstrate that IceCube has a very good reach in this quantity for
AGN nuclei and jets for all source declinations, while the spectra of sources
with strong magnetic fields are found outside the optimal reach. We also
demonstrate where neutrinos from kaon decays and muon tracks from tau decays
can be relevant for the detector response. Finally, we point out the
complementarity between IceCube and other experiments sensitive to high-energy
neutrinos, at the example of 2004-2008 Earth-skimming neutrino data from Auger.
We illustrate that Auger, in principle, is better sensitive to the parameter
region in the Hillas plane from which the highest-energetic cosmic rays may be
expected in this model.

interaction in cold and ultracold collisions. We focus on collisions between
magnetically trapped NH molecules, but the theory is general for any two
paramagnetic species for which the electronic spin and its space-fixed
projection are (approximately) good quantum numbers. It is shown that dipolar
spin relaxation is directly associated with magnetic-dipole induced avoided
crossings that occur between different adiabatic potential curves. For a given
collision energy and magnetic field strength, the cross-section contributions
from different scattering channels depend strongly on whether or not the
corresponding avoided crossings are energetically accessible. We find that the
crossings become lower in energy as the magnetic field decreases, so that
higher partial-wave scattering becomes increasingly important \textit{below} a
certain magnetic field strength. In addition, we derive analytical
cross-section expressions for dipolar spin relaxation based on the Born
approximation and distorted-wave Born approximation. The validity regions of
these analytical expressions are determined by comparison with the NH + NH
cross sections obtained from full coupled-channel calculations. We find that
the Born approximation is accurate over a wide range of energies and field
strengths, but breaks down at high energies and high magnetic fields. The
analytical distorted-wave Born approximation gives more accurate results in the
case of s-wave scattering, but shows some significant discrepancies for the
higher partial-wave channels. We thus conclude that the Born approximation
gives generally more meaningful results than the distorted-wave Born
approximation at the collision energies and fields considered in this work.

high-energy electrons. In the previous study, assuming the power-law
distribution for electrons, we derived the analytic expression for the spectral
intensity function $I(\omega)$ in the Thomson approximation, which was
applicable up to the photon energies of $\omega <$ O(GeV). In the present
paper, we extend the previous work to higher photon energies of $\omega >$
O(GeV) by taking into account the terms dropped in the Thomson approximation,
i.e., the Klein-Nishina formula. The analytic expression for $I(\omega)$ is
derived with the Klein-Nishina formula. It is shown that $I(\omega)$ has a
""knee"" structure at $\omega =$ O(PeV). The knee, if exists, should be
accessible with gamma-ray observatories such as Fermi-LAT. We propose simple
analytical formulae for $I(\omega)$ which are applicable to wide photon
energies from Thomson region to extreme Klein-Nishina region.

of one-quasiproton configurations are studied in neutron-rich odd-A Yttrium and
Niobium isotopes. We use a selfconsistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism
based on the Gogny energy density functional with two parametrizations, D1S and
D1M. The equal filling approximation is used to describe odd-A nuclei
preserving both axial and time reversal symmetries. Shape-transition signatures
are identified in the N=60 isotopes in both charge radii and spin-parities of
the ground states. These signatures are a common characteristic for nuclei in
the whole mass region. The nuclear deformation and shape coexistence inherent
to this mass region are shown to play a relevant role in the understanding of
the spectroscopic features of the ground and low-lying one-quasiproton states.
Finally, a global picture of the neutron-rich A=100 mass region from Krypton up
to Molybdenum isotopes is illustrated with the systematics of the nuclear
charge radii isotopic shifts.

through the method studied in Ref. [1], it is possible to obtain a unified
result for the one-loop correction to the Euclidean effective action in 2+1
dimensions. Our result simplifies into the ones given in the literature
calculated via different techniques based on some assumptions of field and its
derivative. The one-loop correction is obtained in (2n+1)-dimensional Euclidean
space-times, as well. Moreover, its generic behavior is discussed for
non-homogeneous backgrounds. Afterwards, the structure of the divergence for
scalar field theories at one-loop is discussed by studying the one-loop
correction in 2n-dimensional Euclidean space-times. The beta function of the
O(N)-invariant nonlinear sigma-model in d=2+1 is calculated at leading order in
the 1/N expansion without using the epsilon-expansion method.

consider a scenario exploiting the multipartite entanglement in a

purification requires an infinite amount of input states in both cases, we show
that for an imperfect output fidelity the multipartite procedure exhibits a
major advantage in terms of input states used.
