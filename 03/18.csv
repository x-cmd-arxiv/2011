two coupled one dimensional lattices with different anharmonicity. We study how
the interchain coupling modifies the thermal properties of the isolated

lattice interacting with an anharmonic one is able to support a linear thermal
gradient when it is connected to two heat reservoirs at different temperatures.
We estimate this critical coupling by applying the self-consistent phonon

connections between the harmonic and the anharmonic chains, our results show
that the coupled system reveals as a thermal rectifier.

of randomly growing trees. For any finite maximum vertex degree $D$, we find a
one parameter model, with parameter $\alpha \in [0,1]$ which has a so--called
Markov branching property. When $D=\infty$ we find a two parameter model with
an additional parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$ which also has this feature. In the
case $D = 3$, the model bears resemblance to Ford's $\alpha$--model of
phylogenetic trees and when $D=\infty$ it is similar to its generalization, the
$\alpha\gamma$--model. For $\alpha = 0$, the model reduces to the well known
model of preferential attachment. In the case $\alpha > 0$, we prove
convergence of the finite volume probability measures, generated by the growth
rules, to a measure on infinite trees which is concentrated on the set of trees
with a single spine. We show that the annealed Hausdorff dimension with respect
to the infinite volume measure is $1/\alpha$. When $\gamma = 0$ the model
reduces to a model of growing caterpillar graphs in which case we prove that
the Hausdorff dimension is almost surely $1/\alpha$ and that the spectral
dimension is almost surely $2/(1+\alpha)$. We comment briefly on the
distribution of vertex degrees and correlations between degrees of neighbouring

the Galaxy, especially because of the good determination for a wide range of
values of parameters such as age, distance, reddening, and proper motion. The
reliable determination of the parameters strongly depends on the photometry
available and especially on the U filter, which is used to obtain the color
excess E(B-V) through the color-color diagram (U-B) by (B-V) by fitting a zero
age main-sequence. Owing to the difficulty of performing photometry in the U
band, many authors have tried to obtain E(B-V) without the filter. But because
of the near linearity of the color-color diagrams that use the other bands,
combined with the fact that most fitting procedures are highly subjective (many
done ""by eye"") the reliability of those results has always been questioned. Our
group has recently developed, a tool that performs isochrone fitting in
open-cluster photometric data with a global optimization algorithm, which
removes the need to visually perform the fits and thus removes most of the
related subjectivity. Here we apply our method to a set of synthetic clusters
and two observed open clusters (Trumpler 1 and Melotte 105) using only
photometry for the BVRI bands. Our results show that, considering the cluster
structural variance caused only by photometric and Poisson sampling errors, our
method is able to recover the synthetic cluster parameters with errors of less
than 10% for a wide range of ages, distances, and reddening, which clearly
demonstrates its potential. The results obtained for Trumpler 1 and Melotte 105
also agree well with previous literature values.

most comprehensive identification of Martian CO2 ice clouds has been obtained
by the near-IR imaging spectrometer OMEGA. CRISM, a similar instrument with a
higher spatial resolution, cannot detect these clouds with the same method due
to its shorter wavelength range. Here we present a new method to detect CO2
clouds using near-IR data based on the comparison of H2O and CO2 ice spectral
properties. The spatial and seasonal distributions of 54 CRISM observations
containing CO2 clouds are reported, in addition to 17 new OMEGA observations.
CRISM CO2 clouds are characterized by grain size in the 0.5-2\mum range and
optical depths lower than 0.3. The distributions of CO2 clouds inferred from
OMEGA and CRISM are consistent with each other and match at first order the
distribution of high altitude (>60km) clouds derived from previous studies. At
second order, discrepancies are observed. We report the identification of H2O
clouds extending up to 80 km altitude, which could explain part of these
discrepancies: both CO2 and H2O clouds can exist at high, mesospheric
altitudes. CRISM observations of afternoon CO2 clouds display morphologies
resembling terrestrial cirrus, which generalizes a previous result to the whole
equatorial clouds season. Finally, we show that morning OMEGA observations have
been previously misinterpreted as evidence for cumuliform, and hence
potentially convective, CO2 clouds.

initial conditions that we consider, hydrodynamics turns out to be definitely
applicable for proper times larger than 0.7 in units of inverse temperature at
thermalization. We observe a sizable anisotropy in the energy-momentum tensor

This suggests that effective thermalization in heavy ion collisions may occur
significantly earlier than true thermalization.

size in a model of binary choice with externalities (Schelling 1973, Watts
2002). Agents are connected on a network and can be in one of two states of the
world, 0 or 1. Initially, all are in state 0 and a small number of seeds are
selected at random to switch to state1. A simple threshold rule specifies
whether other agents switch subsequently. The cascade size (the percolation) is
the proportion of all agents which eventually switches to state 1. We select
information on the connectivity of the initial seeds, the connectivity of the
agents to which they are connected, the thresholds of these latter agents, and
the thresholds of the agents to which these are connected. We obtain results
for random, small world and scale -free networks with different network
parameters and numbers of initial seeds. The results are robust with respect to
these factors. We perform least squares regression of the logit transformation
of the cascade size (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989) on these potential explanatory
variables. We find considerable explanatory power for the ex ante prediction of
cascade sizes. For the random networks, on average 32 per cent of the variance
of the cascade sizes is explained, 40 per cent for the small world and 46 per
cent for the scale-free. The connectivity variables are hardly ever significant
in the regressions, whether relating to the seeds themselves or to the agents
connected to the seeds. In contrast, the information on the thresholds of
agents contains much more explanatory power. This supports the conjecture of
Watts and Dodds (2007.) that large cascades are driven by a small mass of
easily influenced agents.

of N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory with the U(N) gauge group and N_f flavors
(N_f>N). Both theories from the dual pair support non-Abelian strings which
confine monopoles. Now we introduce an N=2-breaking deformation, a mass term
\mu{\mathcal A}^2 for the adjoint fields. Starting from a small deformation we
eventually make it large which enforces complete decoupling of the adjoint
fields. We show that the above non-Abelian duality fully survives in the limit
of N=1 SQCD, albeit some technicalities change. For instance, non-Abelian
strings which used to be BPS-saturated in the N=2 limit, cease to be saturated
in N=1 SQCD. Our duality is a distant relative of Seiberg's duality in N=1
SQCD. Both share some common features but have drastic distinctions. This is
due to the fact that Seiberg's duality apply to the monopole rather than quark
vacua.
  More specifically, in our theory we deal with N< N_f<3/2 N massive quark
flavors. We consider the vacuum in which N squarks condense. Then we identify a
crossover transition from weak to strong coupling. At strong coupling we find a
dual theory, U(N_f-N) SQCD, with N_f light dyon flavors. Dyons condense
triggering the formation of non-Abelian strings which confine monopoles.
Screened quarks and gauge bosons of the original theory decay into confined
monopole-antimonopole pairs and form stringy mesons.

liquid-liquid transition in supercooled silicon, subsequently supported by

liquid-liquid critical end point at negative pressures, from computer
simulations using the SW potential. Compressibilities exhibit a growing maximum
upon lowering temperature below 1500 K and isotherms exhibit density
discontinuities below 1120 K, at negative pressure. Below 1120 K, isotherms
obtained from constant volume-temperature simulations exhibit non-monotonic,
van der Waals-like behavior signaling a first order transition. We identify Tc
~ 1120 +/- 12 K, Pc -0.60 +/- 0.15 GPa as the critical temperature and pressure

dramatically upon decreasing the temperature and pressure. Diffusivities vary
over 4 orders of magnitude, and exhibit anomalous pressure dependence near the
critical point. A strong relationship between local geometry quantified by the
coordination number, and diffusivity, is seen, suggesting that atomic mobility

with the notion of a bounded homomorphic image of a free lattice---in short,
bounded lattice. Urquhart proved in 1978 that every associahedron is bounded
(thus so are its sublattices). Geyer conjectured in 1994 that every finite
bounded lattice embeds into some associahedron. We disprove Geyer's conjecture,
by introducing an infinite collection of lattice-theoretical identities that
hold in every associahedron, but not in every finite bounded lattice. Among
those finite counterexamples, there are the permutohedron on four letters P(4),
and in fact two of its subdirectly irreducible retracts, which are Cambrian
lattices of type A. For natural numbers m and n, we denote by B(m,n) the
(bounded) lattice obtained by doubling a join of m atoms in an (m+n)-atom
Boolean lattice. We prove that B(m,n) embeds into an associahedron iff min(m,n)
is less than or equal to 1, and that B(m,n) embeds into a permutohedron iff
min(m,n) is less than or equal to 2. In particular, B(3,3) cannot be embedded
into any permutohedron. Nevertheless we prove that B(3,3) is a homomorphic
image of a sublattice of the permutohedron on 12 letters.

breaking should occur consistently without unwanted Goldston bosons, \mu-term

fermion masses with small quark mixing angles and large lepton mixing angles
should be generated with some predictivity. Significant progress has been made
over the years towards achieving these goals in the context of supersymmetric
SO(10) GUT. A complete SO(10) model is presented along this line wherein,
somewhat surprisingly, the GUT scale threshold corrections to the gauge

proton lifetime. An interesting correlation between the d=6 (p\to e^+\pi^0) and
d=5 (p\to \nu-bar K^+) decay amplitudes is observed. This class of models
predicts that both proton decay modes should be observable with an improvement

of major axis of the BCG toward the distribution of cluster satellite
galaxies). We find that the BCG alignment signal becomes stronger as the
redshift and BCG absolute magnitude decrease, and becomes weaker as BCG stellar
mass decreases. No dependence of the BCG alignment on cluster richness is
found. We can detect a statistically significant ($\ge$ 3 sigma) satellite
alignment (the alignment of the major axes of the cluster satellite galaxies
toward the BCG) only when we use the isophotal fit position angles (PAs,
hereafter), and the satellite alignment depends on the apparent magnitudes
rather than the absolute magnitudes of the BCGs. This suggests the detected
satellite alignment based on isophotoal PAs from the SDSS pipeline is possibly
due to the contamination from the diffuse light of nearby BCGs. We caution that
this should not be simply interpreted as non-existence of the satellite
alignment, but rather that we cannot detect them with our current photometric
SDSS data. We perform our measurements on both SDSS $r$ band and $i$ band data,

sextet diquarks, and axigluons. We consider the detailed predictions of these
models for the invariant mass and rapidity distributions of the asymmetry at
the parton level, comparing against the unfolded parton-level CDF results.
While all models can reproduce the asymmetry with the appropriate choice of
mass and couplings, it appears at first examination that the extracted
parton-level invariant mass distribution for all models are in conflict with
Tevatron observations. We show on closer examination, however, that t tbar
events in Z'_H and W' models have considerably lower selection efficiencies in
high invariant mass bins as compared to the Standard Model, so that W', Z'_H,
and axigluon models can generate the observed asymmetry while being consistent
with the total cross-section and invariant mass spectrum. Triplet and sextet
models have greater difficulty producing the observed asymmetry while remaining
consistent with the total cross-section and invariant mass distribution. To
more directly match the models and the CDF results, we proceed to decay and
reconstruct the tops, comparing our results against the ""raw"" CDF asymmetry and
invariant mass distributions. We find that the models that successfully
generate the corrected CDF asymmetry at the parton level reproduce very well
the more finely binned uncorrected asymmetry. Finally, we discuss the early LHC

surface density profiles of {\Sigma} \varpropto r^-1/2, and temperature
profiles of the form T \varpropto r^-{\beta}, where {\beta} ranges 0-2. We find
that steep ({\beta} > 1) temperature profiles lead to outward migration of low
mass protoplanets in interstellar grain opacity discs, but in more optically
thin discs the migration is always inwards. The trend in migration rates with
changing {\beta} obtained from our models shows good agreement with those
obtained using recent analytic descriptions which include consideration of the
co-orbital torques and their saturation. We find that switching between two
models of the protoplanet, one in which accretion acts by evacuating gas and
one in which gas piles up on a surface to form an atmosphere, leads to a small
shift in the migration rates. If comparing these models in discs with
conditions which lead to a marginally inward migration, the small shift can
lead to outward migration. However, the direction and speed of migration is
dominated by disc conditions rather than by the specific prescription used to
model the flow near the protoplanet.

unique view of the largest angular scales in the Universe. Study of these
scales is hampered by the facts that we have only one Universe to observe, only
a few independent samples of the underlying statistical distribution of these
modes, and an incomplete sky to observe due to the interposing Galaxy.
Techniques for reconstructing a full sky from partial sky data are well known
and have been applied to the large angular scales. In this work we critically
study the reconstruction process and show that, in practise, the reconstruction
is biased due to leakage of information from the region obscured by foregrounds
to the region used for the reconstruction. We conclude that, despite being
suboptimal in a technical sense, using the unobscured region without
reconstructing is the most robust measure of the true CMB sky. We also show
that for noise free data reconstructing using the usual optimal, unbiased
estimator may be employed without smoothing thus avoiding the leakage problem.
Unfortunately, directly applying this to real data with noise and residual,
unmasked foregrounds yields highly biased reconstructions requiring further
care to apply this method successfully to real-world CMB.

residual, i.e., the difference between the current approximation and the true
function. The final approximation is thus a linear combination of multivariate
normal densities, where the coefficients are chosen to achieve a good fit to
the target distribution. We illustrate on real and artificial examples that the
proposed procedure is a computationally efficient alternative to current
approaches for approximation of multivariate probability densities. The
R-package iterLap implementing the methods described in this article is
available from the CRAN servers.

helical and nonhelical triple-ring configurations. Unlike earlier nonhelical
configurations, the present ones cannot trivially be reduced via flux
annihilation to a single ring. For the $n$-foil knots the decay is described by
power laws that range form $t^{-2/3}$ to $t^{-1/3}$, which can be as slow as
the $t^{-1/3}$ behavior for helical triple-ring structures that were seen in
earlier work. The two nonhelical configurations decay like $t^{-1}$, which is
somewhat slower than the previously obtained $t^{-3/2}$ behavior in the decay
of interlocked rings with zero magnetic helicity. We attribute the difference
to the creation of local structures that contain magnetic helicity which
inhibits the field decay due to the existence of a lower bound imposed by the
realizability condition. We show that net magnetic helicity can be produced
resistively as a result of a slight imbalance between mutually canceling
helical pieces as they are being driven apart. We speculate that higher order
topological invariants beyond magnetic helicity may also be responsible for
slowing down the decay of the two more complicated nonhelical structures

insulators, which are of extensive interest; it contributes to the electronic
properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices.
Ultracold atoms, quantum many-body systems under precise experimental control,
would seem to be an ideal platform to study these fascinating SO coupled
systems. While an atom's intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic
structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the center-of-mass
motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba and
Dresselhaus strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensate by dressing
two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers. Not only is this the first SO
coupling realized in ultracold atomic gases, it is also the first ever for
bosons. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions
between the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum
phase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase
separated state (above a critical laser intensity). The location of this
transition is in quantitative agreement with our theory. This SO coupling --
equally applicable for bosons and fermions -- sets the stage to realize
topological insulators in fermionic neutral atom systems.

0.05 vs. -1.48 +/- 0.05). These trends are qualitatively consistent with
expectations from simulations of major mergers in which merging systems during
the peak star-formation rate period evolve from M_20 = -1.0 to M_20 = -1.7.
Less obscured ULIRGs (i.e., non-DOGs) tend to have more regular, centrally
peaked, single-object morphologies rather than diffuse and irregular
morphologies. This distinction in morphologies may imply that less obscured
ULIRGs sample the merger near the end of the peak star-formation rate period.
Alternatively, it may indicate that the intense star-formation in these
less-obscured ULIRGs is not the result of a recent major merger.

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating parameterised galactic
outflows. Without outflows, galaxies overproduce stellar masses (M*) and star
formation rates (SFRs) compared to observations. Winds introduce a three-tier
form for the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions, where the
middle tier depends on differential (i.e. mass-dependent) recycling of ejected
wind material back into galaxies. A tight M*-SFR relation is a generic outcome
of all these simulations, and its evolution is well-described as being powered
by cold accretion, although current observations at z>2 suggest that star
formation in small early galaxies must be highly suppressed. Roughly one-third
of z=0 galaxies at masses below M^* are satellites, and star formation in
satellites is not much burstier than in centrals. All models fail to suppress
star formation and stellar mass growth in massive galaxies at z<2, indicating
the need for an external quenching mechanism such as black hole feedback. All
models also fail to produce dwarfs as young and rapidly star-forming as
observed. An outflow model following scalings expected for momentum-driven
winds broadly matches observed galaxy evolution around M^* from z=0-3, which is
a significant success since these galaxies dominate cosmic star formation, but
the failures at higher and lower masses highlight the challenges still faced by
this class of models. We argue that central star-forming galaxies are
well-described as living in a slowly-evolving equilibrium between inflows from
gravity and recycled winds, star formation, and strong and ubiquitous outflows
that regulate how much inflow forms into stars. Star-forming galaxy evolution
is thus primarily governed by the continual cycling of baryons between galaxies
and intergalactic gas.

highly resolved images in space. It relies on $k$-space undersampling and
multiple receiver coils with complementary sensitivity profiles in order to
reconstruct a full Field-Of-View (FOV) image. The performance of parallel
imaging mainly depends on the reconstruction algorithm, which can proceed
either in the original $k$-space (GRAPPA, SMASH) or in the image domain
(SENSE-like methods). To improve the performance of the widely used SENSE
algorithm, 2D- or slice-specific regularization in the wavelet domain has been
efficiently investigated. In this paper, we extend this approach using
3D-wavelet representations in order to handle all slices together and address
reconstruction artifacts which propagate across adjacent slices. The extension
also accounts for temporal correlations that exist between successive scans in
functional MRI (fMRI). The proposed 4D reconstruction scheme is fully
\emph{unsupervised} in the sense that all regularization parameters are
estimated in the maximum likelihood sense on a reference scan. The gain induced
by such extensions is first illustrated on EPI image reconstruction but also
measured in terms of statistical sensitivity during a fast event-related fMRI
protocol. The proposed 4D-UWR-SENSE algorithm outperforms the SENSE
reconstruction at the subject and group-levels (15 subjects) for different
contrasts of interest and using different parallel acceleration factors on
$2\times2\times3$mm$^3$ EPI images.

vibrational modes are found to depend strongly on the average number of nearest

glassy cluster. In particular, the median phonon frequency, $\omega_{med}$, is
essentially constant for $\bar{NN}$ $<2$ and then grows linearly with
$\bar{NN}$ for $\bar{NN}$ $>2$. This behavior parallels concurrent observations
about local isostatic structures, which are absent in clusters with $\bar{NN}$
$<2$ and then grow linearly in number for $\bar{NN}$$>2$. Thus, cluster
vibrational properties appear to be strongly connected to cluster mechanical
stability (i.e., fraction of locally isostatic regions), and the scaling of
$\omega_{med}$ with $\bar{NN}$ is reminiscent of the behavior of packings of
spheres with repulsive interactions at the jamming transition. Simulations of
random networks of springs corroborate observations and suggest that
connections between phonon spectra and nearest neighbor number are generic to
disordered networks.

admits an exact potential function and this allows us to show that it has a
unique equilibrium almost surely. Furthermore, using the game's potential
property, we derive a modified version of the replicator dynamics of
evolutionary game theory which applies to this continuous game, and we show
that if the network's users employ a distributed learning scheme based on these
dynamics, then they converge to equilibrium exponentially quickly. On the other
hand, a major challenge occurs if the channels do not remain static but
fluctuate stochastically over time, following a stationary ergodic process. In
that case, the associated ergodic game still admits a unique equilibrium, but
the learning analysis becomes much more complicated because the replicator
dynamics are no longer deterministic. Nonetheless, by employing results from
the theory of stochastic approximation, we show that users still converge to
the game's unique equilibrium.
  Our analysis hinges on a game-theoretical result which is of independent
interest: in finite player games which admit a (possibly nonlinear) convex
potential function, the replicator dynamics (suitably modified to account for
nonlinear payoffs) converge to an eps-neighborhood of an equilibrium at time of
order O(log(1/eps)).

late-type AGN galaxies present a narrow range in color, with a typical constant
$\lambda$ value. We also find that the fraction of AGN hosting galaxies in our
sample strongly depends on galactic spin, increasing dramatically for
decreasing $\lambda$. For AGN host galaxies we compute the mass of their
supermassive black holes and find that this value tends to be higher for low

Georgia Tech (GT), great strides have been made developing epitaxial graphene
on silicon carbide (EG) as a new electronic material. EG has not only
demonstrated its potential for large scale applications, it also has become an
invaluable material for fundamental two-dimensional electron gas physics
showing that only EG is on route to define future graphene science. It was long
known that graphene mono and multilayers grow on SiC crystals at high
temperatures in ultra-high vacuum. At these temperatures, silicon sublimes from
the surface and the carbon rich surface layer transforms to graphene. However
the quality of the graphene produced in ultrahigh vacuum is poor due to the
high sublimation rates at relatively low temperatures. The GT team developed
growth methods involving encapsulating the SiC crystals in graphite enclosures,
thereby sequestering the evaporated silicon and bringing growth process closer
to equilibrium. In this confinement controlled sublimation (CCS) process, very
high quality graphene is grown on both polar faces of the SiC crystals. Since
2003, over 50 publications used CCS grown graphene, where it is known as the
""furnace grown"" graphene. Graphene multilayers grown on the carbon-terminated
face of SiC, using the CCS method, were shown to consist of decoupled high
mobility graphene layers. The CCS method is now applied on structured silicon
carbide surfaces to produce high mobility nano-patterned graphene structures
thereby demonstrating that EG is a viable contender for next-generation
electronics. Here we present the CCS method and demonstrate several of
epitaxial graphene's outstanding properties and applications.

to occur for much lower ionisation levels than would otherwise be possible.
However, simulations suggest that the consequences for the saturated state are
not as significant as suggested by the linear instability. Close inspection
reveals that that the simulations have not yet probed the Hall-dominated
regime. Here we revisit the effect of Hall diffusion on the MRI and the
implications for the extent of MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs.
  We conduct a local stability analysis for a vertical, weak magnetic field
subject to axisymmetric perturbations with a vertical wave vector. The
diffusivity dependence is presented using analytic expressions and contours in
the eta_H - eta_P plane for the maximum growth rate and corresponding wave
number, the upper cut-off for unstable wave numbers, and the loci that divide
the plane into regions of different characteristic behaviour. In the
highly-diffusive limit the magnetic field decouples from the fluid
perturbations and the diffusive MRI reduces to a diffusive plane-parallel shear
instability with effective shear rate 1.5 Omega. We give analytic expressions
for the growth rate and wave number of the most unstable mode.
  Finally, we illustrate the critical effect of Hall diffusion on the extent of
dead zones in protoplanetary discs by applying a local stability criterion to a
simple model of the minimum-mass solar nebula at 1 au, including x-ray and
cosmic-ray ionisation and a population of 1 micron grains. Hall diffusion
increases or decreases the MRI-active column density by an order of magnitude
or more, depending on whether B is parallel or antiparallel to the rotation
axis, respectively. Existing estimates of the depth of magnetically active
layers in protoplanetary discs are likely to be wildly inaccurate.

cosmological distances will be attenuated by cosmic microwave and infrared
background radiation through photohadronic processes. Lower energy
extra-galactic cosmic rays (~10^18-10^19 eV) can only travel a linear distance
smaller than ~Gpc in a Hubble time due to the diffusion if the extra-galactic
magnetic fields are as strong as nano Gauss. These prevent us from directly
observing most of the UHECRs in the universe, and thus the observed UHECR
intensity reflects only the emissivity in the nearby universe within hundreds
of Mpc. However, UHECRs in the distant universe, through interactions with the
cosmic background photons, produce UHE electrons and gamma-rays that in turn
initiate electromagnetic cascades on cosmic background photons. This secondary
cascade radiation forms part of the extragalactic diffuse GeV-TeV gamma-ray
radiation and, unlike the original UHECRs, is observable. Motivated by new
measurements of extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background radiation by
Fermi/LAT, we obtained upper limits placed on the UHECR emissivity in the
distant universe by requiring that the cascade radiation they produce not
exceed the observed levels. By comparison with the gamma-ray emissivity of
candidate UHECR sources (such as GRBs and AGNs) at high-redshifts, we find that
the obtained upper limit for a flat proton spectrum is ~10^1.5 times larger
than the gamma-ray emissivity in GRBs and ~10 times smaller than the gamma-ray
emissivity in BL Lac objects. In the case of iron nuclei composition, the
derived upper limit of the UHECR emissivity is a factor of 3-5 times higher.
Robust upper limit on the cosmogenic neutrino flux is further obtained, which
is marginally reachable by the Icecube detector and the next-generation
detector JEM-EUSO.

along the ab-plane that Hc2ab(0) = 30 T is clearly lower than the orbital
limiting field Hc2orb,ab (0) = 39.6 T estimated by the |dHc2ab / dT|Tc,
suggesting the presence of both Pauli- and orbital-limiting effects in the pair
breaking process. The best fit of Hc2ab(T) to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg
formula results in the Maki parameter {\alpha} = 0.9 and negligible spin-orbit
scattering constant ({\lambda}so = 0.0). On the other hand, for H along the
c-axis, Hc2c(T) increases linearly down to our lowest temperature of 0.8 K,
which can be explained by the multi-band effects. The anisotropy ratio Hc2ab(T)
/ Hc2c(T) is 3 near Tc and systematically decreases upon lowering temperature
to become 1.3 at zero temperature. A comparative overview of the behavior of
Hc2ab(T) in various Fe-based superconductors shows that, similar to LiFeAs, the
calculated Hc2orb,ab (0) is generally much larger than the measured Hc2ab(0)
and thus finite {\alpha} values ranging from ~ 0.4 to 3 are necessary to
describe the low temperature Hc2ab(T) behaviors. Moreover, LiFeAs is found to
have the smallest |dHc2ab / dT|Tc values, indicating that LiFeAs is one of the
cleanest Fe-based superconductors with a finite Maki parameter. We also discuss
the implications of multi-band effects and spin-orbit scattering based on the
finding that the estimated Pauli-limiting field is generally much larger than
the BCS prediction in the Fe-based superconductors.

on-line without computationally expensive re-analysis of the data set. The
range of tensor indices can be extended dynamically without modifying the
component representation. This idea originates from a mathematical model of
semantic memory and a method known as random indexing in natural language
processing. We generalize the random-indexing algorithm to tensors and present
signal-to-noise-ratio simulations for representations of vectors and matrices.
We present also a mathematical analysis of the approximate orthogonality of
high-dimensional ternary vectors, which is a property that underpins this and
other similar random-coding approaches to dimension reduction. To further
demonstrate the properties of random indexing we present results of a synonym
identification task. The method presented here has some similarities with
random projection and Tucker decomposition, but it performs well at high
dimensionality only (n>10^3). Random indexing is useful for a range of complex
practical problems, e.g., in natural language processing, data mining, pattern
recognition, event detection, graph searching and search engines. Prototype

emitted by a quantum dot, temporally shaping single photon wave-packets on
timescales fast compared to their radiative decay by electro-optic modulation.
In particular, telecommunications-band single photons resulting from the
recombination of an exciton in a quantum dot with exponentially decaying
wave-packets are synchronously modulated to create Gaussian-shaped single
photon wave-packets. We explore other pulse-shapes and investigate the
feasibility of this technique for increasing the indistinguishability of
quantum dot generated single photons.

within a purely magnetic approach. Using some Hamiltonian models for the

unified way. Away from resonances, it induces a drastic enhancement of magnetic
confinement that favors robust internal transport barriers (ITBs) and
stochastic transport reduction. When low-shear occurs for values of the winding
of the magnetic field lines close to low-order rationals, the amplitude
thresholds of the resonant modes that break internal transport barriers by
allowing a radial stochastic transport of the magnetic field lines may be quite
low. The approach can be applied to assess the robustness versus magnetic
perturbations of general (almost) integrable magnetic steady states, including
non-axisymmetric ones such as the important single helicity steady states. This
analysis puts a constraint on the tolerable mode amplitudes compatible with
ITBs and may be proposed as a possible explanation of diverse experimental and

We also define the concept of ""uncertainty region"" which might be of
independent interest. We provide a full characterization of this region for the
case of two correlated random variables. The bounding technique works as
follows: on one hand we show that if the communication problem is solvable, the
uncertainty of certain random variables in the network with respect to
imaginary parties that have partial knowledge of the sources must satisfy some
constraints that depend on the network architecture. On the other hand, the
same uncertainties have to satisfy constraints that only depend on the joint
distribution of the sources. Matching these two leads to restrictions on the
statistical joint distribution of the sources in communication problems that
are solvable over a given network architecture.

heat conductivity in the limit \Delta T \to 0 is reduced to the heat

T_{thr}(N) \sim N^{-3} with the lattice size N. Some unusual properties of heat

the density and velocity power spectra at each wavenumber bins from the
measured clustering features of galaxies in redshift space, including
marginalization over uncertainties inherent in the Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect.
The reconstruction can be done assuming that the density and velocity power
spectra depend on the redshift-space power spectrum having different angular
modulations of mu with mu^{2n} (n=0,1,2) and that the model FoG effect is given
as a multiplicative function in the redshift-space spectrum. By using N-body
simulations and the halo catalogs, we test our method by comparing the
reconstructed power spectra with the simulations. For the spectrum of mu^0 or
equivalently the density power spectrum P_dd(k), our method recovers the
amplitudes to a few percent accuracies up to k=0.3 h/Mpc for both dark matter
and halos. For the power spectrum of mu^2, which is equivalent to the
density-velocity spectrum P_dv(k) in the linear regime, our method can recover
the input power spectrum for dark matter up to k=0.2 h/Mpc and at both z=0 and
1, if using the adequate FoG model. However, for the halo spectrum, the
reconstructed spectrum shows greater amplitudes than the simulation P_dv(k). We
argue that the disagreement is ascribed to nonlinearity effect that arises from
the cross-bispectra of density and velocity perturbations. Using the
perturbation theory, we derive the nonlinear correction term, and find that the
leading-order correction term is proportional to mu^2 and increases the
mu^2-power spectrum amplitudes at larger k, at lower redshifts and for more
massive halos. We find that adding the nonlinearity correction term to the
simulation P_dv(k) can fairly well reproduce the reconstructed P_dv(k) for
halos up to k~0.2 h/Mpc.

freely about its C$_3$ symmetry axis. In the static field inside the cage
degenerate $\nu_3$ and $\nu_4$ vibrational modes are blue shifted and split.
When dynamic coupling with translational motion is considered, the spectral
signature of the $\nu_2$ mode is modified with a higher hindering barrier (2451
cm$^{-1}$), an effective reduced mass (6.569 g.mol$^{-1}$) and a longer
tunneling time (55594 ps) for the fundamental level compared to gas-phase
values (2047 cm$^{-1}$), (2.563 g.mol$^{-1}$) and (20.85 ps). As a result this
mode is red shifted. Moreover, simulation shows that the changes in the
bar-spectrum of the latter mode can be used to probe the temperature of the
surrounding media in which fullerene is observed.

showed clear flux variations during the monitoring period 1998-2007, and the
multi-epoch flux data in two different bands obtained on the same night showed
a linear flux-to-flux relationship for all target QSOs. Assigning the flux in
the longer wavelength to the x-axis in the flux-to-flux diagram, the
x-intercept of the best-fit linear regression line was positive for most
targets, which means that their colors in the observing bands become bluer as
they become brighter. Then, the host-galaxy flux was estimated on the basis of
the correlation between the stellar mass of the bulge of the host galaxy and
the central black hole mass. We found that the longer-wavelength flux of the
host galaxy was systematically smaller than that of the fainter extension of
the best-fit regression line at the same shorter-wavelength flux for most
targets. This result strongly indicates that the spectral shape of the
continuum emission of QSOs in the UV region usually becomes bluer as it becomes
brighter. We found that the multi-epoch flux-to-flux plots could be fitted well
with the standard accretion disk model changing the mass accretion rate with a
constant black hole mass for most targets. This finding strongly supports the

electric and one magnetic, by demanding that their field strengths should be
dual to each other. This requirement is the condition of twisted self-duality.
It can be extended to p-forms in spacetime of D dimensions, and it survives the
introduction of a variety of couplings among forms of different rank, and also
to spinor and scalar fields, which emerge naturally from supergravity. In this
paper we provide a systematic derivation of the action principle, whose
equations of motion are the condition of twisted self-duality. The derivation
starts from the standard Maxwell action, extended to include the aforementioned
couplings, and proceeds via the Hamiltonian formalism through the resolution of
Gauss' law. In the pure Maxwell case we recover in this way an action that had
been postulated by other authors, through an ansatz based on an action given
earlier by us for untwisted self-duality. Those authors also extended their
ansatz to include Chern-Simons couplings. In that case, we find a different
result. The derivation from the standard extended Maxwell action implies of
course that the theory is Lorentz-invariant and can be locally coupled to
gravity. Nevertherless we include a direct compact Hamiltonian proof of these
properties, which is based on the surface-deformation algebra. The symmetry in
the dependence of the action on the electric and magnetic variables is
manifest, since they appear as canonical conjugates. Spacetime covariance,
although present, is not manifest.

quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the ionizing star, and the empirical
analysis of the nebular images and spectroscopy. We determine the stellar

the Huygens region (brightest part of the Orion nebula) in the M43 region. We
show the importance of an adequate correction of this scattered light from the

total nebular H_alpha luminosity, the nebular physical conditions and chemical
abundances. We perform a detailed nebular empirical analysis of 9 apertures
extracted from a long-slit located to the west of HD37061, obtaining the

of the analyzed elements (O, S, and N) we could determine total abundances

(CCDs) to detect and image the incoming photons. The performance of a CCD
detector depends on its ability to transfer electrons through the silicon

single amplifier. This process of electron transfer is highly susceptible to
the effects of solar proton damage (or non-ionizing radiation damage). This is
because charged particles passing through the CCD displace silicon atoms,
introducing energy levels into the semi-conductor bandgap which act as
localized electron traps. The reduction in Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)
leads to signal loss and image smearing. The European Space Agency's
astrometric Gaia mission will make extensive use of CCDs to create the most
complete and accurate stereoscopic map to date of the Milky Way. In the context
of the Gaia mission CTE is referred to with the complementary quantity Charge
Transfer Inefficiency (CTI = 1-CTE). CTI is an extremely important issue that
threatens Gaia's performances. We present here a detailed Monte Carlo model

density distribution within a pixel and the charge capture and release

motional energies of either atoms and molecules, or micromirrors. In the
literature, these two strands are kept largely separate; both, however suffer
from severe limitations. Laser cooling of atoms and molecules largely relies on
the internal level structure of the species being cooled. As a result, only a
small number of elements and a tiny number of molecules can be cooled this way.
In the case of micromirrors, the problem lies in the engineering of
micromirrors that need to satisfy a large number of constraints---these include
a high mechanical Q-factor, high reflectivity and very good optical quality,
weak coupling to the substrate, etc.---in order to enable efficient cooling.
During the course of this thesis, I will draw these two sides of laser cooling
closer together by means of a single, generically applicable scattering theory
that can be used to explain the interaction between light and matter at a very
general level. I use this `transfer matrix' formalism to explore the use of the
retarded dipole--dipole interaction as a means of both enhancing the efficiency
of micromirror cooling systems and rendering the laser cooling of atoms and
molecules less species selective. In particular, I identify the `external
cavity cooling' mechanism, whereby the use of an optical memory in the form of
a resonant element (such as a cavity), outside which the object to be cooled
sits, can potentially lead to the construction of fully integrated
optomechanical systems and even two-dimensional arrays of translationally cold
atoms, molecules or even micromirrors.

generates one-parameter group of conformal transformations. The class of
conformal Killing symmetric tensor fields of an arbitrary rank is a natural
generalization of the class of conformal Killing vector fields, and appears in
different geometric and physical problems. A symmetric tensor field is a
trace-free field if the contraction of the field with the metric tensor is
identically equal to zero. On a Riemannian manifold of dimension at least
three, the space of trace-free conformal Killing symmetric tensor fields of
arbitrary rank is of a finite dimension. On a two-dimensional manifold, the
space can be of infinite dimension. Nevertheless, on a connected manifold of
any dimension, a trace-free conformal Killing tensor field is uniquely
determined by its $C^\infty$-jet at any point. We prove the statement: On a
connected manifold, a trace-free conformal Killing tensor field is identically
equal to zero if it vanishes on some hypersurface. This statement is a basis of
the theorem on decomposition of a symmetric tensor field on a compact
Riemannian manifold with boundary to a sum of three fields such that the first
summand is a trace-free and divergence-free field, the second summand is a
potential field with a trace-free potential vanishing on the boundary, and the
last summand is a multiple of the metric tensor. The classical theorem by
Bochner - Yano states the absence of conformal Killing vector fields on a
closed manifold of negative Ricci curvature. We generalize the latter
statements to arbitrary rank tensor fields but under the stronger hypothesis:
the sectional curvature is assumed to be negative. There is no nontrivial
trace-free conformal Killing symmetric tensor field of any rank on a closed
negatively curved Riemannian manifold.

state of N spin- 1 2 particles can be represented by N spinors, which
correspond geometrically to N points on the Bloch sphere. Several decades after
its conception, the Majorana representation has recently attracted a great deal
of attention in connection with multiparticle entanglement. A novel use of this
represen- tation led to the classification of entanglement families of
permutation symmetric qubits - based on the number of distinct spinors and
their arrangement in constituting the multiqubit state. An elegant approach to
explore how correlation information of the whole pure symmetric state gets
imprinted in its parts is developed for specific entanglement classes of
symmetric states. More- over, an elegant and simplified method to evaluate
geometric measure of entanglement in N-qubit states obeying exchange symmetry
has been developed based on the distribution of the constituent Majorana
spionors over the unit sphere. Multiparticle entanglement being a key resource
in sev- eral quantum information processing tasks, its deeper understanding is
essential. In this review, we present a detailed description of the Majorana
representation of pure symmetric states and its applicability in investigating

monitoring of the source was provided by the GASP-WEBT and REM. Moreover,
several Swift ToO observations were triggered, adding important information on
the source behaviour from optical/UV to hard X-rays. We paid particular
attention to the calibration of the Swift/UVOT data to make it suitable to the
blazars spectra. Simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed us
to study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at different
frequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. In the period 9-30 March
2009, AGILE detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2
s^-1 for E>100 MeV, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 on
daily integration. The gamma-ray activity occurred during a period of
increasing activity from near-IR to UV, with a flaring episode detected on
26-27 March 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for the
flux enhancement observed from near-IR to UV. By contrast, Swift/XRT
observations seem to show no clear correlation of the X-ray fluxes with the
optical and gamma-ray ones. However, the X-ray observations show a harder
photon index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most FSRQs and a hint of
harder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a second
emission component at soft X-ray energies. Moreover, the broad band spectrum
from radio-to-UV confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/UV
spectrum of PKS 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. On the other hand,
during 25-26 March 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/UV energy band was
observed, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission in
this part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore a
significant shift of the synchrotron peak.

optimizations return similar and self-consistent parameter values, the model
can be considered universal. Deviations from this behavior can be associated
with a breakdown of the modeling, with the nature of the deviations giving
clues as to the nature of the breakdown. We apply this procedure to study the

Nevertheless, for a long system of this type, the physical behavior in
resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) essentially involves reconnection. This
has been explained in terms comparing the geometric and tearing widths [1, 2].
The concept of a quasi-separatrix layer[3, 4] was developed for such systems.
In this paper we study a model for a line-tied system in which the
corresponding periodic system has an unstable tearing mode. We analyze this
system in terms of two magnetic field line diagnostics, the squashing
factor[3-5] and the electrostatic potential difference used in kinematic
reconnection studies[6, 7]. We discuss the physical and geometric significance

strongly clustered around ~0.75 A. The vast majority of those RGEs for which it
is possible to derive emission line ratios (amounting to about half of the
sample) show values characteristic of LINERs. The close connection between
emission lines and stellar continuum points to stellar processes as the most
likely source of the bulk of the ionizing photons in RGEs, rather than active
nuclei. In particular, the observed EW and optical line ratios are consistent
with the predictions of models in which the photoionization comes from to hot
evolved stars. Shocks driven by supernovae or stellar ejecta might also
contribute to the ionization budget. A minority, ~4%, of the galaxies show
emission lines with an equivalent that is width a factor of ~2 greater than the
sample median. Only among them are Seyfert-like spectra found. Furthermore, 40%

reproduce most of the lines in the observed spectrum to good accuracy. We find
non-local radiative transfer in atomic lines to be an important process also at

these largely neutral Fe/He clumps makes Fe I lines prominent in the emergent
spectrum. Using the best available estimates for the dust extinction, we
determine the amount of 44Ti produced in the explosion to 1.5\pm0.5 * 10^-4
Msun.

saturation effects. In particular we show that the property of saturation of
unintegrated gluon density allows for introduction of thermodynamical entropy
associated with production of gluons. This is due to the observation that
saturation scale acts like a mass of a gluon which related with temperature via
thermodynamical relations allows for calculations of entropy. We also show that
obtained entropy behaves like multiplicity of produced gluons.

precision technique for many QCD observables. However, the calculation of
nucleon matrix elements remains an open challenge. I summarize the status of
the lattice effort by examining one observable that has come to represent this
challenge, average-x: the fraction of the nucleon's momentum carried by its
quark constituents. Recent results confirm a long standing tendency to
overshoot the experimentally measured value. Understanding this puzzle is
essential to not only the lattice calculation of nucleon properties but also
the broader effort to determine hadron structure from QCD.

generalized ensemble techniques and measure the time that a Markovian Monte
Carlo process spends in searching classical ground states. In the quantum limit
we determine the maximum finite correlation length along a quantum adiabatic
trajectory determined by the linear sweep of the adiabatic control parameter in
the Hamiltonian composed of the problem Hamiltonian and the constant transverse
field Hamiltonian. In the median of our ensemble both complexities diverge
exponentially with the number of variables. Hence, standard, conventional
adiabatic quantum computation fails to reduce the computational complexity to
polynomial. Moreover, the growth-rate constant in the quantum limit is 3.8
times as large as the one in the classical limit, making classical fluctuations
more beneficial than quantum fluctuations in ground-state searches.

sequence of n critical steps (Carter 1983, Watson 2008) is applied to both
terrestrial and extraterrestrial origins of life. In the former case, the time
at which humans have emerged during the habitable period of the Earth suggests
a value of n = 4. Progressively adding earlier evolutionary transitions
(Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1995) gives an optimum fit when n = 5, implying
either that their initial transitions are not critical or that habitability
began around 6 Ga ago. The origin of life on Mars or elsewhere within the Solar
System is excluded by the latter case and the simple anthropic argument is that
extraterrestrial life is scarce in the Universe because it does not have time
to evolve. Alternatively, the timescale can be extended if the migration of
basic progenotic material to Earth is possible. If extra transitions are
included in the model to allow for Earth migration, then the start of
habitability needs to be even earlier than 6 Ga ago. Our present understanding
of Galactic habitability and dynamics does not exclude this possibility. We
conclude that Galactic punctuated equilibrium (Cirkovic et al. 2009), proposed
as a way round the anthropic problem, is not the only way of making life more
common in the Galaxy.
