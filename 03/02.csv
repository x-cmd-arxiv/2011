the PHE occurs on the nonmagnetic ionic crystal NaCl, although the magnitude is
very small which is due to the tiny charge-to-mass ratio of the ions. The
off-diagonal thermal conductivity is finite for nonzero magnetic field and
changes sign for high value of magnetic field at high temperature. We also

and the probability that there is an edge between $x$ and $y$ is given by
$p_{xy}=1-\exp\{-\lambda W_xW_y/|x-y|^\alpha\}$. The parameter $\lambda$ is the
percolation parameter, while $\alpha$ describes the long-range nature of the
model. We focus on the degree distribution in the resulting graph, on whether
there exists an infinite component and on graph distance between remote pairs
of vertices.
  First, we show that the tail behavior of the degree distribution is related
to the tail behavior of the weight distribution. When the tail of the
distribution of $W_x$ is regularly varying with exponent $\tau-1$, then the
tail of the degree distribution is regularly varying with exponent
$\gamma=\alpha(\tau-1)/d$. The parameter $\gamma$ turns out to be crucial for
the behavior of the model. Conditions on the weight distribution and $\gamma$
are formulated for the existence of a critical value $\lambda_c\in(0,\infty)$
such that the graph contains an infinite component when $\lambda>\lambda_c$ and
no infinite component when $\lambda<\lambda_c$. Furthermore, a phase transition
is established for the graph distances between vertices in the infinite
component at the point $\gamma=2$, that is, at the point where the degrees
switch from having finite to infinite second moment.
  The model can be viewed as an interpolation between long-range percolation

shares the interesting features of both these models.

which were calibrated on the standard BVRI system of Landolt. These stars are
significantly fainter than those generally used for HST calibration purposes,
and therefore are much better matched to supporting precision photometry of ACS
science targets. We were able to derive more accurate photometric
transformation coefficients for the commonly used ACS broad-band filters
compared to those published by Sirianni, et al. (2005), owing to the use of a
factor of several more calibration stars which span a greater range of color.
We find that the inferred transformations from each cluster individually do not
vary significantly from the average, except for a small offset of the
photometric zeropoint in the F850LP filter. Our results suggest that the

between algebraic models of a given logic and relational structures used to
define the Kripke possible-world semantics for it. Such a new framework offers
a new semantics for many-valued logics based on the truth-invariance
entailment. Consequently, it is substantially different from current
definitions based on a matrix with a designated subset of logic values, used
for the satisfaction relation, often difficult to fix. In the case when the
many-valued modal logics are based on the set of truth-values that are complete
distributive lattices we obtain a compact autoreferential Kripke-style
canonical representation. The Kripke-style semantics for this subclass of modal
logics have the joint-irreducible subset of the carrier set of many-valued
algebras as set of possible worlds. A significant member of this subclass is
the paraconsistent fuzzy logic extended by new logic values in order to also
deal with incomplete and inconsistent information. This new theory is applied
for the case of autoepistemic intuitionistic many-valued logic, based on
Belnap's 4-valued bilattice, as a minimal extension of classical logic used to

a system {\Sigma} such as a glass surrounded by an extremely large medium
{\Sigma}, to show that the instantaneous temperature T(t), thermodynamic
entropy S(T_0,t) and enthalpy H(T_0,t) of {\Sigma} decrease in any isothermal
relaxation towards their respective equilibrium values under isobaric cooling.
The Gibbs statistical entropy also conforms to the above relaxation behavior in
a glass, which however is contrary to the conjecture by Gupta, Mauro and
coworkers that the glass transition and the structural relaxation are inverse
processes. However, they do not establish that the entropy loss during the
glass transition is accompanied by a concomitant entropy gain of the medium to
maintain the second law. They use a novel statistical formulation of entropy
based on several conjectures such as it being zero for a microstate, but do not
compare its behavior with the thermodynamic entropy. The formulation is
designed to show the entropy loss. Its subsequent rise not only contradicts our
result but also implies that the glass during relaxation must have a negative
absolute temperature. To understand these puzzling results and the above
conjecture, we have carried out a critical evaluation of their unconventional
approach. We find that the inverse conjecture is neither supported by their
approach nor by the second law. The zero-entropy microstate conjecture is only
consistent with S(T_0,t)\equiv 0 at all temperatures, not just at absolute zero
and is found to have no scientific merit. We show that the maximum entropy gain
of the medium during the glass transition invalidates the entropy loss
conjecture. After pointing out other misleading, confusing and highly
exaggerated statements in their work, we finally conclude that their
unconventional statistical approach and computational scheme are not
appropriate for glasses.

equations have contributed to a better understanding of non-perturbative

In Yang-Mills theory especially the Landau gauge has been used, as it is the
most accessible gauge for these methods. The growing understanding obtained in
this gauge allows to proceed to other gauges in order to obtain more
information about the relation of different realizations of the confinement
mechanism. In the maximally Abelian gauge first results are very encouraging as
a variant of Abelian infrared dominance is found: The Abelian part of the gauge
field propagator is enhanced at low momenta and thereby dominates the dynamics
in the infrared. Its role is therefore similar to that of the ghost propagator
in the Landau gauge, where one denotes the corresponding phenomenon as ghost
dominance. Also the ambiguity of two different types of solutions (decoupling
and scaling) exists in both gauges. Here we present how the two solutions are
related in the maximally Abelian gauge. The intricacy of the system of
functional equations in this gauge required the development of some new tools
and methods as, for example, the automated derivation of the equations by the
program DoFun. We also present results for linear covariant and ghost

the expectation value of a general observable when a white noise forcing is
introduced in the system, both in the case of additive and multiplicative
noise. We also show that the difference between the expectation value of the
power spectrum of an observable in the stochastically perturbed case and of the
same observable in the unperturbed case is equal to the variance of the noise
times the square of the modulus of the susceptibility describing the
frequency-dependent response of the system to perturbations with the same
spatial patterns as the considered stochastic forcing. Using Kramers-Kronig
theory, it is then possible to derive the susceptibility and thus deduce the
Green function of the system for any desired observable. We then extend our
results to rather general patterns of random forcing, from the case of several
white noise forcings, to noise terms with memory, up to the case of a
space-time random field. Explicit formulas are provided for each relevant case.
As a general result, we find, using an argument of positive-definiteness, that
the power spectrum of the stochastically perturbed system is larger at all
frequencies than the power spectrum of the unperturbed system. We provide a
example of application of our results by considering the Lorenz 96 model. These
results clarify the property of stochastic stability of SRB measures in Axiom A

class of models, our limits are complementary to and competitive with limits on
dark matter annihilation and on WIMP-nucleon scattering from indirect and
direct searches. Our limits, however, do not suffer from systematic and
astrophysical uncertainties associated with direct and indirect limits. For
example, we are able to rule out light (< 10 GeV) thermal relic dark matter
with universal couplings exclusively to charged leptons. In addition, for dark
matter mass below about 80 GeV, LEP limits are stronger than Fermi constraints
on annihilation into charged leptons in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Within its
kinematic reach, LEP also provides the strongest constraints on the
spin-dependent direct detection cross section in models with universal
couplings to both quarks and leptons. In such models the strongest limit is
also set on spin independent scattering for dark matter masses below ~4 GeV.

(2011)] about constraints on the smoothness $\alpha$ parameter and dark energy
models using observational $H(z)$ data. It is argued here that their procedure
is conceptually inconsistent with the basic assumptions underlying the adopted
Dyer-Roeder approach. In order to properly quantify the influence of the $H(z)$
data on the smoothness $\alpha$ parameter, a $\chi^2$-test involving a sample
of SNe Ia and $H(z)$ data in the context of a flat $\Lambda$CDM model is
reanalyzed. This result is confronted with an earlier approach discussed by
Santos et al. (2008) without $H(z)$ data. In the ($\Omega_m, \alpha$) plane, it
is found that such parameters are now restricted on the intervals $0.66 \leq
\alpha \leq 1.0$ and $0.27 \leq \Omega_m \leq 0.37$ within 95.4% confidence
level (2$\sigma$), and, therefore, fully compatible with the homogeneous case.
The basic conclusion is that a joint analysis involving $H(z)$ data can
indirectly improve our knowledge about the influence of the inhomogeneities.
However, this happens only because the $H(z)$ data provide tighter constraints
on the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$.

Furthermore, an analytic treatment of Gutzwiller mean-field theory reveals that
quantum spin fluctuations induced by the Kondo exchange cause the otherwise

show that lattice separability imposes a serious constraint on proposals to
exploit excited bands for quantum simulations, and discuss a way to overcome
this constraint in the context of our model by using an experimentally realized

entanglement is studied for the bipartite subsystems. While for the GHZ states
all the bipartite subsystems are identically disentangled, for the W states the

for ETGs, and the mass and age estimates depend on the choice of the stellar
population model used in the spectral energy distribution fits. We describe in
detail the differences among model predictions for a large range of galaxy
ages, showing the dependence of these differences on age. Current models still
yield large uncertainties. While recent models from Maraston and Charlot &
Bruzual offer better modeling of the TP-AGB phase with respect to less recent
Bruzual & Charlot models, their predictions do not often match. The modeling of
this TP-AGB phase has a significant impact on the derived parameters for
galaxies observed at high-redshift. Some of our results do not depend on the
choice of the model: for all models, the most massive galaxies are the oldest
ones, independent of the environment. When using Maraston and Charlot & Bruzual
models, the mass distribution is similar in the clusters and in the groups,
whereas in our field sample there is a deficit of massive (M $\gtrsim$ 10^11
Msun) ETGs. According to those last models, ETGs belonging to the cluster
environment host on average older stars with respect to group and field
populations. This difference is less significant than the age difference in

mass-selected sample of field contemporaries drawn from the GOODS-South Field.
Robust estimates of the aforementioned parameters have been obtained by
comparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with extensive
8-10 band photometric coverage, from the rest-frame far-ultraviolet to the
infrared. We find no variations of the overall stellar population properties
among the different samples of cluster early-type galaxies. However, when
comparing cluster versus field stellar population properties we find that, even
if the (star formation weighted) ages are similar and depend only on galaxy
mass, the ones in the field do employ longer timescales to assemble their final
mass. We find that, approximately 1 Gyr after the onset of star formation, the
majority (75%) of cluster galaxies have already assembled most (> 80%) of their
final mass, while, by the same time, fewer (35%) field ETGs have. Thus we
conclude that while galaxy mass regulates the timing of galaxy formation, the
environment regulates the timescale of their star formation histories.

we characterize an attenuation parameter that depends on the frequency scaling
as well as the transmission distance. Cut-set upper bounds on the throughput
scaling are then derived in both extended and dense networks having unit node
density and unit area, respectively. It is first analyzed that under extended
networks, the upper bound is inversely proportional to the attenuation
parameter, thus resulting in a highly power-limited network. Interestingly, it
is seen that the upper bound for extended networks is intrinsically related to
the attenuation parameter but not the spreading factor. On the other hand, in
dense networks, we show that there exists either a bandwidth or power
limitation, or both, according to the path-loss attenuation regimes, thus
yielding the upper bound that has three fundamentally different operating
regimes. Furthermore, we describe an achievable scheme based on the simple
nearest-neighbor multi-hop (MH) transmission. We show that under extended
networks, the MH scheme is order-optimal for all the operating regimes. An
achievability result is also presented in dense networks, where the operating
regimes that guarantee the order optimality are identified. It thus turns out
that frequency scaling is instrumental towards achieving the order optimality
in the regimes. Finally, these scaling results are extended to a random network
realization. As a result, vital information for fundamental limits of a variety
of underwater network scenarios is provided by showing capacity scaling laws.

characterize these processes is the duality between these processes and
exchangeable coalescents. A larger class of coalescent processes, called
distinguished coalescents, was set up recently to incorporate an immigration
phenomenon in the underlying population. The purpose of this article is to
define and characterize a class of probability-measure valued processes called
the generalized Fleming-Viot processes with immigration. We consider some
stochastic flows of partitions of Z_{+}, in the same spirit as Bertoin and Le
Gall's flows, replacing roughly speaking, composition of bridges by coagulation
of partitions. Identifying at any time a population with the integers
$\mathbb{N}:=\{1,2,...\}$, the formalism of partitions is effective in the past
as well as in the future especially when there are several simultaneous births.
We show how a stochastic population may be directly embedded in the dual flow.
An extra individual 0 will be viewed as an external generic immigrant ancestor,
with a distinguished type, whose progeny represents the immigrants. The

that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxies might provide stars to the

We avoid the systematic errors plaguing previous studies of AGN accretion rate
by using accurate accretion luminosities (L_int) from well-sampled
multiwavelength SEDs from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), and accurate
black hole masses derived from virial scaling relations (for broad-line AGNs)
or host-AGN relations (for narrow-line and lineless AGNs). In general, broad
emission lines are present only at the highest accretion rates (L_int/L_Edd >
0.01), and these rapidly accreting AGNs are observed as broad-line AGNs or
possibly as obscured narrow-line AGNs. Narrow-line and lineless AGNs at lower
specific accretion rates (L_int/L_Edd < 0.01) are unobscured and yet lack a
broad line region. The disappearance of the broad emission lines is caused by
an expanding radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) at the inner radius
of the accretion disk. The presence of the RIAF also drives L_int/L_Edd < 10^-2
narrow-line and lineless AGNs to 10 times higher ratios of radio to optical/UV
emission than L_int/L_Edd > 0.01 broad-line AGNs, since the unbound nature of
the RIAF means it is easier to form a radio outflow. The IR torus signature
also tends to become weaker or disappear from L_int/L_Edd < 0.01 AGNs, although
there may be additional mid-IR synchrotron emission associated with the RIAF.
Together these results suggest that specific accretion rate is an important
physical ""axis"" of AGN unification, described by a simple model.

different magnetic field strengths affect the observed polarized emission of

addition, statistical tests are performed to investigate the fractional
polarization trends in clusters with different thermal and non-thermal

impact parameter, with fractional polarization increasing at the cluster
periphery and decreasing toward the cluster center. Such trend can be
reproduced by a magnetic field model with central value of few $\mu$G. The
logrank statistical test indicates that there are no differences in the
depolarization trend observed in cluster with and without radio halo, while the
same test indicates significant differences when the depolarization trend of
sources in clusters with and without cool core are compared. The comparison
between clusters with high and low temperatures does not yields significant
differences. Although therole of the gas density should be better accounted

sensitive to different stellar ages. We find that the correlation between

for streamers along great circles in the sky, our extension adds the
kinematical restriction that velocity vectors should also be constrained to lie
along these great circles, as seen by a Galactocentric observer. We show how to
use these combined criteria starting from heliocentric observables. We test it
by using the mock Gaia catalogue of Brown et al. 2005, which includes a
realistic Galactic background and observational errors, but with the addition
of detailed star formation histories for the simulated satellites. We
investigate its success rate as a function of initial satellite luminosity,
star formation history and orbit. We find that the inclusion of the kinematical
restriction vastly enhances the contrast between a streamer and the background,
even in the presence of observational errors, provided we use only data with
good astrometric quality (fractional errors of 30 per cent or better). The
global nature of the method diminishes the erasing effect of phase mixing and
permits the recovery of merger events of reasonable dynamical age. Satellites
with a star formation history different to that of the Galactic background are
also better isolated. We find that satellites in the range of 10^8-10^9 Lsun

star-forming regions. In each case, we directly resolve a dust-depleted disk
cavity around the central star. Using radiative transfer calculations, we
interpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous, parametric model
framework by reproducing their SMA visibilities and SEDs. The cavities in these
disks are large (R_cav = 15-73 AU) and substantially depleted of small
(~um-sized) dust grains, although their mass contents are still uncertain. The
structures of the remnant material at larger radii are comparable to normal
disks. We demonstrate that these large cavities are common among the
millimeter-bright disk population, comprising at least 20% of the disks in the
bright half of the millimeter luminosity (disk mass) distribution. Utilizing
these results, we assess some of the physical mechanisms proposed to account
for transition disk structures. As has been shown before, photoevaporation
models do not produce the large cavity sizes, accretion rates, and disk masses
representative of this sample. It would be difficult to achieve a sufficient
decrease of the dust optical depths in these cavities by particle growth alone:
substantial growth (to meter sizes or beyond) must occur in large (tens of AU)
regions of low turbulence without also producing an abundance of small
particles. Given those challenges, we suggest instead that the observations are
most commensurate with dynamical clearing due to tidal interactions with
low-mass companions --young brown dwarfs or giant planets on long-period
orbits.

millimeter-wave polarimetry is a powerful tool for studying the Milky Way

polarimeter BICEP covering the Galactic longitude range 260 - 340 degrees in
three atmospheric transmission windows centered on 100, 150, and 220 GHz. The

characterizations of the Galactic millimeter-wave frequency spectrum and the
large-scale magnetic field structure permeating the interstellar medium.
Polarized emission is detected over the entire region within two degrees of the
Galactic plane and indicates that the large-scale magnetic field is oriented
parallel to the plane of the Galaxy. An observed trend of decreasing
polarization fraction with increasing total intensity rules out the simplest
model of a constant Galactic magnetic field throughout the Galaxy. Including
WMAP data in the analysis, the degree-scale frequency spectrum of Galactic
polarization fraction is plotted between 23 and 220 GHz for the first time. A
generally increasing trend of polarization fraction with electromagnetic
frequency is found, which varies from 0.5%-1.5%at frequencies below 50 GHz to
2.5%-3.5%above 90 GHz. The BICEP and WMAP data are fit to a two-component
(synchrotron and dust) model showing that the higher frequency BICEP data are
necessary to tightly constrain the amplitude and spectral index of Galactic

the standard-model Yukawa couplings hints at some underlying flavor theory,
which would necessarily control the sizes of the matter-messenger couplings as
well. Thus for example, if the doublet messenger and the Higgs have the same
properties under the flavor theory, the resulting messenger-lepton couplings
are parametrically of the same order as the lepton Yukawas, so that slepton
mass-splittings are similar to those of minimally-flavor-violating models and
therefore satisfy bounds on flavor-violation, with, however, slepton mixings
that are potentially large. Assuming that fermion masses are explained by a
flavor symmetry, we construct viable and natural models with messenger-lepton
couplings controlled by the flavor symmetry. The resulting slepton spectra are
unusual and interesting, with slepton mass-splittings and mixings that may be
probed at the LHC. In particular, since the new contributions are typically
negative, and since they are often larger for the first- and second-generation
sleptons, some of these examples have the selectron or the smuon as the

distinguish a dominant background from the expected feeble signals, based on
some measured discrimination parameter. We develop a statistical model for such
experiments using the Profile Likelihood ratio as a test statistic in a
frequentist approach. We take data from calibrations as control measurements
for signal and background, and the method allows the inclusion of data from
Monte Carlo simulations. Systematic detector uncertainties, such as
uncertainties in the energy scale, as well as astrophysical uncertainties, are
included in the model. The statistical model can be used to either set an
exclusion limit or to make a discovery claim, and the results are derived with
a proper treatment of statistical and systematic uncertainties. We apply the
model to the first data release of the XENON100 experiment, which allows to
extract additional information from the data, and place stronger limits on the
spin-independent elastic WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section. In particular,
we derive a single limit, including all relevant systematic uncertainties, with
a minimum of 2.4x10^-44 cm^2 for WIMPs with a mass of 50 GeV/c^2.

to two ferromagnetic leads by employing an equation of motion method. When the
ferromagnetic leads are coupled with parallel spin polarization, we find three
peaks in the single-particle excitation spectra. The middle one is the Kondo
resonance caused by the orbital degrees of freedom. In magnetic fields, the
Kondo effect vanishes. However, at a certain magnetic field new two-fold
degenerate states arise and the Kondo effect emerges there. In contrast, when
the ferromagnetic leads are coupled with antiparallel spin polarization, the
Kondo effect caused by the spin (orbital) degrees of freedom survives (is
suppressed) in magnetic fields. We investigate the field dependence of the
conductance in the parallel and antiparallel spin polarizations of the leads
and find that the conductance changes noticeably in magnetic fields.

  Assumption",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prior knowledge can improve the performance of spectrum sensing. Instead of
using universal features as prior knowledge, we propose to blindly learn the
localized feature at the secondary user. Motivated by pattern recognition in
machine learning, we define signal feature as the leading eigenvector of the
signal's sample covariance matrix. Feature learning algorithm (FLA) for blind
feature learning and feature template matching algorithm (FTM) for spectrum
sensing are proposed. Furthermore, we implement the FLA and FTM in hardware.
Simulations and hardware experiments show that signal feature can be learned
blindly. In addition, by using signal feature as prior knowledge, the detection
performance can be improved by about 2 dB. Motivated by experimental results,
we derive several GLRT based spectrum sensing algorithms under rank-1
assumption, considering signal feature, signal power and noise power as the
available parameters. The performance of our proposed algorithms is tested on
both synthesized rank-1 signal and captured DTV data, and compared to other
state-of-the-art covariance matrix based spectrum sensing algorithms. In
general, our GLRT based algorithms have better detection performance. In
addition, algorithms with signal feature as prior knowledge are about 2 dB
better than algorithms without prior knowledge.

are to noise. For Bell inequality violations, the simplest test is the
well-known CHSH test, but for EPR-steering and entanglement the tests that
involve the fewest number of detection patterns require non-projective
measurements. The simplest EPR-steering requires a choice of projective
measurement for one agent and a single non-projective measurement for the
other, while the simplest entanglement test uses just a single non-projective
measurement for each agent. In both of these cases, we derive our inequalities
using the concept of circular 2-designs. This leads to the interesting feature
that in our photonic demonstrations, the correlation of interest is independent
of the angle between the linear polarizers used by the two parties, which thus
require no alignment.

Bomber Problem, with the following common probabilistic structure. An aircraft
equipped with an amount~$x$ of ammunition is intercepted by enemy airplanes
arriving according to a homogenous Poisson process over a fixed time
duration~$t$. Upon encountering an enemy, the aircraft has the choice of
spending any amount~$0\le y\le x$ of its ammunition, resulting in the
aircraft's survival with probability equal to some known increasing function of
$y$. Two different goals have been considered in the literature concerning the
optimal amount~$K(x,t)$ of ammunition spent: (i)~Maximizing the probability of
surviving for time~$t$, which is the so-called Bomber Problem, and (ii)
maximizing the number of enemy airplanes shot down during time~$t$, which we
call the Fighter Problem. Several authors have attempted to settle the
following conjectures about the monotonicity of $K(x,t)$: [A] $K(x,t)$ is
decreasing in $t$, [B] $K(x,t)$ is increasing in $x$, and [C] the
amount~$x-K(x,t)$ held back is increasing in $x$. [A] and [C] have been shown
for the Bomber Problem with discrete ammunition, while [B] is still an open
question. In this paper we consider both time and ammunition continuous, and
for the Bomber Problem prove [A] and [C], while for the Fighter we prove [A]

showing that the optimal survival probability and optimal number shot down are
totally positive of order 2 ($\mbox{TP}_2$) in the Bomber and Fighter Problems,
respectively. The $\mbox{TP}_2$ property is shown by constructing convergent
sequences of approximating functions through an iterative operation which
preserves $\mbox{TP}_2$ and other properties.

derived from the Vlasov equation by the 16-moment method, we analyse the
influence of pressure anisotropy exhibited by collisionless magnetized plasmas

We calculate the dispersion relation and the growth rates for these
instabilities in the presence of a background heat flux and for configurations
with static pressure anisotropy, finding that when the frequency at which heat
conduction acts is much larger than any other frequency in the system (i.e.
weak magnetic field) the pressure anisotropy has no effect on the MTI/HBI,
provided the degree of anisotropy is small. In contrast, when this ordering of
timescales does not apply the instability criteria depend on pressure
anisotropy. Specifically, the growth time of the instabilities in the
anisotropic case can be almost one order of magnitude smaller than its
isotropic counterpart. We conclude that in plasmas where pressure anisotropy is
present the MTI/HBI are modified. However, in environments with low magnetic
fields and small anisotropy such as the ICM the results obtained from the
16-moment equations under the approximations considered are similar to those
obtained from ideal MHD.

  Gaussian Inputs","submitted to the Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we consider a discrete-time stationary Rayleigh flat-fading
channel with unknown channel state information at transmitter and receiver. The
law of the channel is presumed to be known to the receiver. In addition, we
assume the power spectral density (PSD) of the fading process to be compactly
supported. For i.i.d. zero-mean proper Gaussian input distributions, we
investigate the achievable rate. One of the main contributions is the
derivation of two new upper bounds on the achievable rate with zero-mean proper
Gaussian input symbols. The first one holds only for the special case of a
rectangular PSD and depends on the SNR and the spread of the PSD. Together with
a lower bound on the achievable rate, which is achievable with i.i.d. zero-mean
proper Gaussian input symbols, we have found a set of bounds which is tight in
the sense that their difference is bounded. Furthermore, we show that the high
SNR slope is characterized by a pre-log of 1-2f_d, where f_d is the normalized
maximum Doppler frequency. This pre-log is equal to the high SNR pre-log of the
peak power constrained capacity. Furthermore, we derive an alternative upper
bound on the achievable rate with i.i.d. input symbols which is based on the
one-step channel prediction error variance. The novelty lies in the fact that
this bound is not restricted to peak power constrained input symbols like known
bounds, e.g. in [1]. Therefore, the derived upper bound can also be used to
evaluate the achievable rate with i.i.d. proper Gaussian input symbols. We
compare the derived bounds on the achievable rate with i.i.d. zero-mean proper
Gaussian input symbols with bounds on the peak power constrained capacity given
in [1-3]. Finally, we compare the achievable rate with i.i.d. zero-mean proper
Gaussian input symbols with the achievable rate using synchronized detection in
combination with a solely pilot based channel estimation.

within the IRDC, with typical rotation temperatures of ~10 to 20K and NH3
column densities of ~10^15 cm^-2. The estimated total mass of G19.30+0.07 is
~1130 Msun. The cloud comprises four compact NH3 clumps of mass ~30 to 160
Msun. Two coincide with 24 micron emission, indicating heating by protostars,
and show evidence of outflow in the NH3 emission. We report a water maser
associated with a third clump; the fourth clump is apparently starless. A
non-detection of 8.4GHz emission suggests that the IRDC contains no bright HII
regions, and places a limit on the spectral type of an embedded ZAMS star to
early-B or later. From the NH3 emission we find G19.30+0.07 is composed of
three distinct velocity components, or ""subclouds."" One velocity component
contains the two 24 micron sources and the starless clump, another contains the
clump with the water maser, while the third velocity component is diffuse, with
no significant high-density peaks. The spatial distribution of NH3 and CCS
emission from G19.30+0.07 is highly anti-correlated, with the NH3 predominantly
in the high-density clumps, and the CCS tracing lower-density envelopes around

processed to other species and/or depleted in high-density regions.

comets testifies in favor of existence of large cavities with material under
gas pressure below a considerable fraction of a comet's surface. Based on
analysis of images of the cloud of material ejected from Comet 9P/Tempel 1
after the collision of the Deep Impact (DI) module with the comet, we studied
the time variations in the rate and velocities of ejection of observed
particles (mainly icy particles with diameter d<3 micron). Comparison of these
dependencies with the theoretical dependencies allowed us to understand the
time variations in the rate of the outburst triggered by the impact. The latter
variations testify in favor of that there were cavities at the place of DI
ejection. The beginning of the increase of the main outburst at 8 s after the
DI impact could be caused by excavation of a relatively large cavity that
contained dust and gas under pressure. The upper boarder of the cavity could be
located at about 5-10 meters below the surface of the comet. This cavity could
be deep because the excavation from the cavity could last for at least a few
tens of seconds. With the increase of the crater, more cavities could be
excavated. The outburst decreased at ~60 s after the impact. Besides the 'fast'
outburst caused by ejection from cavities, there was a 'slow' outburst
ejection, which was similar to the ejection from a 'fresh' surface of a comet
and could be noticeable during 30-60 min. The 'fast' outburst with velocities
~100 m/s probably could continue for at least several tens of seconds, and it
could significantly increase the fraction of particles ejected with velocities
~100 m/s compared with theoretical models of ejection.

presented. Most of them involve a choice of elliptic curves of a \emph{special}

improvements involve a reduction of the number of iterations in the Miller's
algorithm. For the generic case, Blake, Murty and Xu proposed three refinements
to Miller's algorithm over Weierstrass curves. Though their refinements which
only reduce the total number of vertical lines in Miller's algorithm, did not
give an efficient computation as other optimizations, but they can be applied
for computing \emph{both} of Weil and Tate pairings on \emph{all}
pairing-friendly elliptic curves. In this paper we extend the Blake-Murty-Xu's

radius of hollow sphere become zero, we obtain the metric of inner gravity
field of solid sphere. Based on the definition of energy momentum tensor of
general relativity, the gravity masses of hollow and solid spheres in curved
space are calculated strictly. The results indicate that no matter what the
masses and densities of hollow sphere and solid sphere are, space-time
singularities would appear in the centers of spheres. Meanwhile, no matter what
the mass and density are, the intensity of pressure at the center point of
solid sphere can not be infinite. That is to say, the material can not collapse
towards the center of so-called black hole. In stead, it may be that there
exist the spherical surfaces of infinite pressure inside the hollow and solid
spheres, and material would collapse toward the surfaces so that the common
spheres are unsteady. At the center of solid sphere and on its neighboring
region, pressure intensities would become negative values. There may be a
region for hollow sphere in which pressure intensities would become negative
values too. The results only indicate that the singularity black holes
predicated by general relativity are caused by the descriptive method of curved
space-time and can not exist in nature actually. If black holes exist really in

show that F-{\mu}-F oscillations should evolve into a Lorentzian Kubo-Toyabe
decay for an increasing static magnetic field distribution {\Gamma} (i.e.,
increasing x), but the data do not show this behavior, consistent with the
recently reported existence of strong magnetic fluctuations in this system at
low temperatures. Anisotropy in the field distribution is shown to cause small
errors of order 10% from behavior predicted for an isotropic distribution.
Finally, numerical calculations show that values of {\Gamma} calculated in the

suggesting that strong correlations play an important role in this system.

small fraction of the Eddington rate, which corresponds to $L \ga 0.06
L_{Edd}$, the inner region of the disk is radiation-pressure-dominated and
thermally unstable. However, observations of the high/soft state of black hole
X-ray binaries with luminosity well within this regime ($0.01L_{Edd} \la L \la
0.5L_{Edd}$) indicate that the disk has very little variability, i.e., quite
stable. Recent radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a vertically
stratified shearing box have confirmed the absence of the thermal instability.
In this paper, we revisit the thermal stability by linear analysis, taking into
account the role of magnetic field in the accretion flow. By assuming that the
field responses negatively to a positive temperature perturbation, we find that
the threshold of accretion rate above which the disk becomes thermally unstable
increases significantly compared with the case of not considering the role of
magnetic field. This accounts for the stability of the observed sources with
high luminosities. Our model also presents a possible explanation as to why
only GRS 1915+105 seems to show thermally unstable behavior. This peculiar
source holds the highest accretion rate (or luminosity) among the known high
state sources, which is well above the accretion rate threshold of the
instability.

Lienard-Wiechert-like potentials for the Poincar\'e fields. After numerical

~80 per cent in SDSS J0924+0219 at the projected locations of the lensed

central kiloparsec of the barred spiral lens galaxy, where we expect stars to
dominate the mass distribution. In this system, we find a smooth matter
percentage that is consistent with zero.

network coding capacity of networks under various network coding schemes. In
this thesis, we address the problem with two approaches: matroidal networks and
capacity regions.
  In our matroidal approach, we prove the converse of the theorem which states
that, if a network is scalar-linearly solvable then it is a matroidal network
associated with a representable matroid over a finite field. As a consequence,
we obtain a correspondence between scalar-linearly solvable networks and
representable matroids over finite fields in the framework of matroidal
networks. We prove a theorem about the scalar-linear solvability of networks
and field characteristics. We provide a method for generating scalar-linearly
solvable networks that are potentially different from the networks that we
already know are scalar-linearly solvable.
  In our capacity region approach, we define a multi-dimensional object, called
the network capacity region, associated with networks that is analogous to the
rate regions in information theory. For the network routing capacity region, we
show that the region is a computable rational polytope and provide exact
algorithms and approximation heuristics for computing the region. For the
network linear coding capacity region, we construct a computable rational
polytope, with respect to a given finite field, that inner bounds the linear
coding capacity region and provide exact algorithms and approximation
heuristics for computing the polytope. The exact algorithms and approximation
heuristics we present are not polynomial time schemes and may depend on the
output size.

multiple edge types. Our main motivation is that similarity between objects can
be defined by many different metrics and aggregation of these metrics into a
single one poses several important challenges, such as recovering this
aggregation function from ground-truth, investigating the space of different
clusterings, etc. In this paper, we address how to find an aggregation function
to generate a composite metric that best resonates with the ground-truth. We
describe two approaches: solving an inverse problem where we try to find
parameters that generate a graph whose clustering gives the ground-truth
clustering, and choosing parameters to maximize the quality of the ground-truth
clustering. We present experimental results on real and synthetic benchmarks.

derived that yields the mean-square amplitudes and rms surface velocities of
normal modes of non-relativistic stars excited by arbitrary gravitational wave
(GW) radiation. In particular, stationary GW fields are considered and the
resulting formulae are evaluated for two general types of GW radiation:
radiation from a particular astrophysical source (e.g., a binary system) and a
stochastic background of gravitational waves (SBGW). Expected sources and
signal strengths for both types of GW radiation are reviewed and discussed.
Numerical results for the Sun show that low-order quadrupolar g modes are
excited more strongly than p modes by orders of magnitude. Maximal rms surface
velocities in the case of excitation by astrophysical sources are found to be v
{\le} 10^(-8) mm/s, assuming GW strain amplitudes of h {\le} 10^(-20). It is
shown that current models for an SBGW produced by cosmic strings, with Omega_GW
~ 10^(-8)-10^(-5) in the frequency range of solar g modes, are able to produce
maximal solar g-mode rms surface velocities of 10^(-5)-10^(-3) mm/s. This
result lies close to or within the amplitude range of 10^(-3)-1 mm/s expected
from excitation by turbulent convection, which is currently considered to be
responsible for stellar g-mode excitation. It is concluded that studying g-mode
observations of stars other than the Sun, in which excitation by GWs could be
even more effective due to different stellar structures, might provide a new
method to either detect GWs or to deduce a significant direct upper limit on an
SBGW at intermediate frequencies between the pulsar bound and the bounds from
interferometric detectors on Earth.

theoretically possible to reconstruct the species tree from known probabilities

to reflect clades on the species tree, while those with smaller probabilities

the variability of type I quasars. Quasars' variability amplitudes and
luminosities are tightly correlated, on average. Magnification due to
gravitational lensing increases the quasars' apparent luminosity, while leaving
the variability amplitude unchanged. Therefore, the mean magnification of an
ensemble of quasars can be measured through the mean shift in the
variability-luminosity relation. As a proof of principle, we use this technique
to measure the magnification of quasars spectroscopically identified in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, due to gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters in
the SDSS MaxBCG catalog. The Palomar-QUEST Variability Survey, reduced using
the DeepSky pipeline, provides variability data for the sources. We measure the
average quasar magnification as a function of scaled distance (r/R200) from the
nearest cluster; our measurements are consistent with expectations assuming NFW
cluster profiles, particularly after accounting for the known uncertainty in
the clusters' centers. Variability-based lensing measurements are a valuable
complement to shape-based techniques because their systematic errors are very
different, and also because the variability measurements are amenable to
photometric errors of a few percent and to depths seen in current wide-field
surveys. Given the data volume expected from current and upcoming surveys, this
new technique has the potential to be competitive with weak lensing shear
measurements of large scale structure.

random time argument $\widetilde{\mathcal{T}}_{\nu_{1,}\nu_{2}}(t)$ can be
expressed, for any fixed $t$, in terms of convolutions of stable-laws. The new
process $N(\widetilde{\mathcal{T}}_{\nu_{1,}\nu_{2}})$ is itself a renewal and
can be shown to be a Cox process. Moreover we prove that the survival

the Maxwell stress tensor method to compute the electromagnetic forces, we
investigate electromagnetic wave induced forces acting on a pair of identical
metal plates that forms an electromagnetic resonance cavity. Different
frequency regimes are considered, from infrared frequencies with micron scale
structures down to the microwave regime which involves millimeter scale
structures. We found that at both length scales, the electromagnetic wave
induced forces can be significantly stronger than the usual photon pressure
exerted by a laser beam if the cavity is excited at resonance although the
mechanisms that underlie the strong force are different at different length
scales. In the infrared frequency regime, the strong force is induced by field
penetration into the metal, whereas in the microwave regime, the
electromagnetic force is induced by the leakage of electric field at the edges.
At both frequency scales, we compare the results we obtained for Au metal
plates with fictitious perfect electric conductor plates so as to understand
the effect of field penetration. We also showed that a transmission line model
can give simple expressions that can capture the essence of the physics. The
effect of surface corrugation and surface roughness is also investigated, and
we find that corrugation/roughness generally induces attraction between the

the relative stability of the biaxial nematic phase, with respect to
non-uniform phases such as smectic and columnar, in fluids made of hard
board-like particles with sizes $\sigma_1>\sigma_2>\sigma_3$. A
restricted-orientation (Zwanzig) approximation is adopted. Varying the ratio
$\kappa_1=\sigma_1/\sigma_2$ while keeping $\kappa_2=\sigma_2/\sigma_3$, we
predict phase diagrams for various values of $\kappa_2$ which include all the
uniform phases: isotropic, uniaxial rod- and plate-like nematics, and biaxial
nematic. In addition, spinodal instabilities of the uniform phases with respect
to fluctuations of the smectic, columnar and plastic-solid type, are obtained.
In agreement with recent experiments, we find that the biaxial nematic phase
begins to be stable for $\kappa_2\simeq 2.5$. Also, as predicted by previous
theories and simulations on biaxial hard particles, we obtain a region of
biaxility centred on $\kappa_1\approx\kappa_2$ which widens as $\kappa_2$
increases. For $\kappa_2\agt 5$ the region $\kappa_2\approx\kappa_1$ of the
packing-fraction vs. $\kappa_1$ phase diagrams exhibits interesting topologies
which change qualitatively with $\kappa_2$. We have found that an increasing
biaxial shape anisotropy favours the formation of the biaxial nematic phase.
Our study is the first to apply FMT theory to biaxial particles and, therefore,
it goes beyond the second-order virial approximation. Our prediction that the
phase diagram must be asymmetric is a genuine result of the present approach,
which is not accounted for by previous studies based on second-order theories.

tunneling diode (RTD) based on a Zn$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Se/ZnBeSe heterostructure.
Using the Wigner-Poisson method and assuming the two-current model we have
calculated the current-voltage characteristics, potential energy profiles and
electron density distributions for spin-up and spin-down electron current in an
external magnetic field. We have found that -- for both the spin-polarized
currents -- two types of the current hysteresis appear on the current-voltage
characteristics. The current hysteresis of the first type occurs at the bias
voltage below the resonant current peak and results from the accumulation of
electrons in the quantum well layer. The current hysteresis of the second type
appears at the bias voltage above the resonant current peak and is caused by
the creation of the quasi-bound state in the left contact region and the
resonant tunneling through this quasi-bound state. The physical interpretation
of both the types of the current hysteresis is further supported by the
analysis of the calculated self-consistent potential profiles and electron
density distributions. Based on these results we have shown that -- in certain
bias voltage and magnetic field ranges -- the spin polarization of the current

are still interested in Lamb-Dicke parameters $\eta \ll 1$. Our results show
that the Rabi frequency of the cooling laser can be chosen higher than
previously assumed, thereby increasing the effective cooling rate but {\em not}
affecting the final outcome of the cooling process. Since laser cooling is
already a well established experimental technique, the main aim of this paper
is to present a model which can be extended to more complex scenarios, like
cavity-mediated laser cooling.

particles. Dullemond and Dominik (2005) pointed out for the first time the
difficulty in explaining the strong mid-IR excess of classical T-Tauri stars
without any dust-retention mechanisms. Because high relative velocities in
between micrometer-sized and macroscopic particles exist in protoplanetary
disks, we present experimental results on the erosion of macroscopic
agglomerates consisting of micrometer-sized spherical particles via the impact
of micrometer-sized particles. We find that after an initial phase, in which an
impacting particle erodes up to 10 particles of an agglomerate, the impacting
particles compress the agglomerate's surface, which partly passivates the
agglomerates against erosion. Due to this effect the erosion halts within our
error bars for impact velocities up to ~30 m/s. For larger velocities, the
erosion is reduced by an order of magnitude. This outcome is explained and
confirmed by a numerical model. In a next step we build an analytical disk
model and implement the experimentally found erosive effect. The model shows
that erosion is a strong source of micrometer-sized particles in a
protoplanetary disk. Finally we use the stationary solution of this model to
explain the amount of micrometer-sized particles in observational infrared data

the 21 cm emission of the neutral IGM. In this article, we study the effects

address the question of the detectability by the planned Square Kilometre

could provide an unambiguous diagnostic for the cosmological origin of the
signal remaining after the foreground cleaning procedure. Also, they could be
used as a new type of standard rulers. We determine the differential brightness
temperature of the 21 cm signal in the presence of inhomogeneous

both ionizing and Lyman lines 3D radiative transfer with the code LICORICE. We
find that the Lyman horizons are clearly visible on the maps and radial

interval, typically \Delta z \approx 2 at z \sim 13. Stacking the profiles of
the different sources of the simulation at a given redshift results in
extending this interval to \Delta z \approx 4. When we take into account the

those in cool-core clusters tend to have two-sided parsec scale jets, while
those in less relaxed clusters have predominantly one-sided parsec scale jets.

  information","16 pages including 5 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sensory systems take continuously varying stimuli as their input and encode
features relevant for the organism's survival into a sequence of action
potentials - spike trains. The full dynamic range of complex dynamical inputs
has to be compressed into a set of discrete spike times and the question,
facing any sensory system, arises: which features of the stimulus are thereby
encoded and how does the animal decode them to recover its external sensory
world?
  Here we study this issue for the two motion-sensitive H1 neurons of the fly's
optical system, which are sensitive to horizontal velocity stimuli, each neuron
responding to oppositely pointing preferred directions. They constitute an
efficient detector for rotations of the fly's body about a vertical axis.
Surprisingly the spike trains $\rho_B(t)$ generated by an empoverished stimulus
$S_B(t)$, containing just the instants when the of velocity $S(t)$ reverses its
direction, convey the same amount of global (Shannon) information as spike
trains $\rho(t)$ generated by the complete stimulus $S(t)$. This amount of
information is just enough to encode the instants of velocity reversal. Yet
this suffices to give the motor system just one, yet vital order: go left or
right, turning the H1 neurons into efficient analog-to-digital converters.
Furthermore also probability distributions computed from $\rho(t)$ and
$\rho_B(t)$ are identical. Still there are regions in the spike trains
following velocity reversals, 80 msec long and containing about 3-6 msec long
spike intervals, where detailed stimulus properties are encoded. We suggest a
decoding scheme - how to reconstruct the stimulus from the spike train, which
is fast and works in real time.

dominance of the nuclear breakup over the Coulomb one prevented from obtaining
the information about the $\alpha + d \to {}^{6}{\rm Li} + \gamma$ process from
the breakup data. The astrophysical $S_{24}(E)$ factor has been calculated
within the $\alpha-d$ two-body potential model with potentials determined from
the fits to the $\alpha-d$ elastic scattering phase shifts. However, the
scattering phase shift itself doesn't provide a unique $\alpha-d$ bound state
potential, which is the most crucial input when calculating the $S_{24}(E)$
astrophysical factor at astrophysical energies. In this work we emphasize an
important role of the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) for
${}^{6}{\rm Li} \to \alpha + d$, which controls the overall normalization of
the peripheral $\alpha + d \to {}^{6}{\rm Li} + \gamma$ process and is
determined by the adopted $\alpha-d$ bound state potential. We demonstrate that
the ANC previously determined from the $\alpha-d$ elastic scattering $s$-wave
phase shift in [Blokhintsev {\it et. al} Phys. Rev. {\bf C 48}, 2390 (1993)]

exhibits a crossover from a strongly damped transient at short times towards an
exponential thermalization at long times. In the limit of strong interactions,
the thermalization time is consistent with the exponentially small decay rate
for artificially created doublons, which was measured in ultracold atomic
gases. When the interaction is comparable to the bandwidth, on the other hand,
the double occupancy thermalizes within a few times the inverse bandwidth along
a rapid thermalization path in which the exponential tail is absent. Similar
behavior can be observed in time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our
results show that a simple quasi-equilibrium description of the electronic

channel resembles a multiple user channel (MAC) from the point of view of the
secondary user. The secondary senses the current state of the primary at the
start of each block. We show that the optimal power transmitted depends on the
sensed state and the optimal power profile is paranoid, i.e. either growing or
decaying in power as a function of time. We show that such a scheme achieves
capacity when there is no noise in the sensing. The optimal transmission for
the secondary performs rate splitting and follows a layered water-filling power
allocation for each parallel channel to achieve capacity. The secondary rate
approaches a genie-aided scheme for large block-lengths. Additionally, if the
fraction of time primary uses the channel tends to one, the paranoid scheme and
the genie-aided upper bound get arbitrarily close to a no-sensing scheme.

study, it is determined that the choice of the passphrase is the weakest part
of the entire 802.11 wireless security system.

preserve only part of the topology of an observed network are systematically
used as fundamental null models. However, their generation is still
problematic. The existing approaches are either computationally demanding and
beyond analytic control, or analytically accessible but highly approximate.
Here we propose a solution to this long-standing problem by introducing an
exact and fast method that allows to obtain expectation values and standard
deviations of any topological property analytically, for any binary, weighted,
directed or undirected network. Remarkably, the time required to obtain the
expectation value of any property is as short as that required to compute the
same property on the single original network. Our method reveals that the null
behavior of various correlation properties is different from what previously
believed, and highly sensitive to the particular network considered. Moreover,
our approach shows that important structural properties (such as the modularity
used in community detection problems) are currently based on incorrect
expressions, and provides the exact quantities that should replace them.

networks fit within the common framework of Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(CSPs). Inspired by the requirements of these applications, where variables are
located at distinct network devices that may not be able to communicate but may
interfere, we define natural criteria that a CSP solver must possess in order
to be practical. We term these algorithms decentralized CSP solvers. The best
known CSP solvers were designed for centralized problems and do not meet these
criteria. We introduce a stochastic decentralized CSP solver and prove that it
will find a solution in almost surely finite time, should one exist, also
showing it has many practically desirable properties. We benchmark the
algorithm's performance on a well-studied class of CSPs, random k-SAT,
illustrating that the time the algorithm takes to find a satisfying assignment
is competitive with stochastic centralized solvers on problems with order a
thousand variables despite its decentralized nature. We demonstrate the
solver's practical utility for the problems that motivated its introduction by
using it to find a non-interfering channel allocation for a network formed from
data from downtown Manhattan.
