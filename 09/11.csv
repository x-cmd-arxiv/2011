qubit-environment interactions are energy conserving. We trace out the
variables of the thermal environments and N-2 qubits to obtain the
time-dependent reduced density matrix for two arbitrary qubits. We numerically
simulate the reduced dynamics and the creation of entanglement (concurrence) as
a function of the parameters of the thermal environments and the number of

decreases as N increases. We show analytically that in the limit N tending to

thermal environments cannot create two-qubit entanglement when many qubits are
located within a region of the size of the environment coherence length. We
discuss possible applications of our approach to the development of a new
quantum characterization of noisy environments.

reservoirs. Each spin-reservoir interaction consists of an energy exchange and
an energy conserving channel. We prove a resonance representation of the
reduced dynamics of the spins, valid for all times t>=0, with errors (small
interaction) estimated rigorously, uniformly in time. Subspaces associated to
non-interacting energy differences evolve independently, partitioning the
reduced density matrix into dynamically decoupled clusters of jointly evolving
matrix elements. Within each subspace the dynamics is markovian with a
generator determined entirely by the resonance data of the full Hamiltonian.
Based on the resonance representation we examine the evolution of entanglement
(concurrence). We show that, whenever thermalization takes place, entanglement
of any initial state dies out in a finite time and will not return. For a
concrete class of initially entangled spin states we find explicit bounds on
entanglement survival and death times in terms of the initial state and the
resonance data.

particular, the method takes into account the injection of particles and the
behaviour of magnetic field at shocks with different obliquities as well as the
radiation losses of electrons downstream of the shock. The method is used to
model images of SN 1006. The images well correlate with the observations in

substituted Zinc Oxide (Zn1-xMgxO) nanocrystals (~10-12nm) synthesized by low
temperature route. In the low temperature synthesis route it was possible to
reach x = 0.17 without segregation of Mg rich phase. The exact chemical
composition has been established by quantitative analysis. Rietveld analysis of
the XRD data confirms the Wurzite structure and a continuous compaction of the
lattice (in particular the c-axis parameter) as x increases. There is an
enhancement of the strain in the lattice as the Mg is substituted. The bandgap
also gets enhanced as x is increased and reaches a value of 4eV for x = 0.17.
From the TEM and the XRD data it has been concluded that when there is a phase
segregation for x > 0.17, there is a shell of Mg(OH)2 on the ZnO. The
absorption also shows persistence of the excitoinc absorption on Mg
substitution. The nanocrystals show near band edge photo luminescence (PL) at
room temperature which shows blue shift on Mg incorporation. In addition to the
near band edge emission the ZnO and Zn1-xMg xO alloy nanocrystals show
considerable emission in the blue-green region at wavelength of ~550 nm. We
find that the relative intensity of the green emission increases with the Mg
concentration for very low x (upto x = 0.05) and on further increase of the Mg
concentration there is a sharp decrease of relative intensity of the green
emission eventually leading to a complete quenching of blue emission. It is
concluded that due to phase segregation (for x \geq 0.20), the formation of the
shell of Mg(OH)2 on the ZnO leads to quenching of the green emission .However,
this shell formation does not have much effect on the near band edge PL.

by replacing every (n+1)th (100) mixed plane of La and In atoms with a plane of
Co-atoms. For the n=1 phase, LaCoIn5, jump frequencies were too small to
detect. Two signals were observed, one for indium atoms next to the Co-planes
and the other for more distant indium atoms. No relaxation was observed for
atoms next to the Co-planes, indicating that there is no diffusion across the
Co-planes. With increasing n, jump rates for the other In-atoms increased
toward values observed for LaIn3. Jump frequency activation enthalpies for n= 3

quadrupole interaction signal that is consistent with indium probes dissolved
in small liquid pools of the excess Ga. A myriad of such pools are probably
located along grain boundaries in the sample. Cooling from 293 K down to 12 K,
the site fraction of indium in liquid decreased, being offset by the increase
in a signal attributed to indium solutes in precipitates with other impurities
at the sides of the Ga pools. However, these changes were completely reversible
upon heating, and no crystallization of the liquid gallium pools was observed
down to 12 K. This is attributed to the extraordinarily small volumes for the

cubic microns. The measured temperature dependence of the site fraction of

charged event in three-dimensional spacetime. We start by exhibiting a first
integral of the equations of motion in terms of the three conserved components
of the spacetime angular momentum, and then proceed numerically. After crossing
the light cone of the event, an electric charge initially at rest starts
rotating and slowing down. There are two lengths appearing in the problem: (i)
the characteristic length $\frac{q g}{2 \pi m}$, where $q$ and $m$ are the
electric charge and mass of the particle, and $g$ is the magnetic charge of the
event; and (ii) the spacetime impact parameter $r_0$. For $r_0 \gg \frac{q g}{2

turn and comes to rest at the same spatial position at which the event happened
in the past. This jump is the main signature of the presence of the magnetic
event as felt by an electric charge. A derivation of the expression for the
angular momentum that uses Noether's theorem in the magnetic representation is

very strong wind speeds. For tidally locked hot Jupiters, winds at high
altitude in the planet's atmosphere advect heat from the day side to the cooler
night side of the planet. Net wind speeds on the order of 1-10 km/s directed
towards the night side of the planet are predicted at mbar pressures, which is
the approximate pressure level probed by transmission spectroscopy. These winds
should result in an observed blue shift of spectral lines in transmission on
the order of the wind speed. Indeed, Snellen et al. (2010) recently observed a
2 +/- 1 km/s blue shift of CO transmission features for HD 209458b, which has
been interpreted as a detection of the day-to-night winds that have been
predicted by 3-D atmospheric dynamics modeling. Here we present the results of
a coupled 3-D atmospheric dynamics and transmission spectrum model, which
predicts the Doppler-shifted spectrum of a hot Jupiter during transit resulting
from winds in the planet's atmosphere. We explore four different models for the
hot Jupiter atmosphere using different prescriptions for atmospheric drag via
interaction with planetary magnetic fields. We find that models with no
magnetic drag produce net Doppler blue shifts in the transmission spectrum of
~2 km/s and that lower Doppler shifts of ~1 km/s are found for the higher drag
cases, results consistent with -- but not yet strongly constrained by -- the
Snellen et al. (2010) measurement. We additionally explore the possibility of
recovering the average terminator wind speed as a function of altitude by
measuring Doppler shifts of individual spectral lines and spatially resolving
wind speeds across the leading and trailing terminators during ingress and
egress.

of emitter spontaneous emission into competing Fabry-Perot (FP) modes in the
microdisk cavity. Based on this analysis, we propose a new type of photonic
crystal microdisk (PCM) laser to drastically suppress the photonic density of
states in the vertical FP modes. As a result, we obtained a three fold increase
of {\beta} than previously reported highest {\beta} of 0.15 at room
temperature. The spontaneous emission control in truncated photonic crystals
becomes efficient when the period number is more than one. We also demonstrate
a three-stack PCM laser at low temperature with {\beta} as high as 0.72, which
is 24 times higher than that in typical single microdisk (0.03), which also
results in 50% threshold reduction.

Thirring model, as well as of its zero temperature case, in canonical
quantization scheme originates from the intrinsic hidden exact linearizability
of Heisenberg equations by means of dynamical mapping onto the Schr\""odinger
physical fields. The normal forms of different one- and two- parametric
(thermo) field's solutions are obtained. They are connected with each other by
making use of generalized conformal shift transformations. The sequential use
of bosonic canonical transformations provides a correct renormalization,
anticommutation and symmetry properties of these solutions. The dynamical role
of inequivalent representations of 1+1-D free massless Dirac fields, that are
induced by inequivalent representations of 1+1-D free massless (pseudo) scalar
field, and the appearance of Schwinger terms are elucidated. The inequivalent
vacuum is established as coherent state for SU(1,1) group. A new alternative
sources of superselection rules are shown. A generalization of Ojima tilde
conjugation rules is suggested, which reveals the properties of coherent state
for SU(2) group for the fermionic thermal vacuum state and is useful for the
thermofield bosonization. The notions of ""hot"" and ""cold"" thermofields are
introduced to distinguish different thermofield representations giving the
correct normal form of thermofield solution. The weak sense of definition of
zero and finite temperature operator bosonization rules in the framework of
thermofield dynamics is demonstrated.

Scott and Jesse Windle","The Bayesian Bridge","Supplemental files are available from the second author's website",,,,"stat.ME stat.CO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose the Bayesian bridge estimator for regularized regression and
classification. Two key mixture representations for the Bayesian bridge model
are developed: (1) a scale mixture of normals with respect to an alpha-stable
random variable; and (2) a mixture of Bartlett--Fejer kernels (or triangle
densities) with respect to a two-component mixture of gamma random variables.
Both lead to MCMC methods for posterior simulation, and these methods turn out
to have complementary domains of maximum efficiency. The first representation
is a well known result due to West (1987), and is the better choice for
collinear design matrices. The second representation is new, and is more
efficient for orthogonal problems, largely because it avoids the need to deal
with exponentially tilted stable random variables. It also provides insight
into the multimodality of the joint posterior distribution, a feature of the
bridge model that is notably absent under ridge or lasso-type priors. We prove
a theorem that extends this representation to a wider class of densities
representable as scale mixtures of betas, and provide an explicit inversion
formula for the mixing distribution. The connections with slice sampling and
scale mixtures of normals are explored. On the practical side, we find that the
Bayesian bridge model outperforms its classical cousin in estimation and
prediction across a variety of data sets, both simulated and real. We also show
that the MCMC for fitting the bridge model exhibits excellent mixing
properties, particularly for the global scale parameter. This makes for a
favorable contrast with analogous MCMC algorithms for other sparse Bayesian
models. All methods described in this paper are implemented in the R package
BayesBridge. An extensive set of simulation results are provided in two
supplemental files.

to the capture of one component around the MBH and the ejection of its
companion at a high velocity, possibly producing a hypervelocity star. The high
fraction of observed triples ($\sim10$% for F/G/K stars and $\sim50$% for OB
stars) give rise to the possibility of the disruption of triples by a MBH. Here
we study this scenario, and use direct $N$-body integrations to follow the
orbits of thousands of triples, during and following their disruption by a MBH
(of $4\times10^6$ M$_\odot$, similar to the MBH existing in the Galactic
Centre; SgrA$^*$). We find that triple disruption can lead to several outcomes
and we discuss their relative frequency. Beside the ejection/capture of single
stars, similar to the binary disruption case, the outcomes of triple disruption
include the ejection of hypervelocity binaries; capture of binaries around the
MBH; collisions between two or all of the triple components (with low enough
velocities that could lead to their merger); and the capture of two or even
three stars at close orbits around the MBH. The orbits of single stars captured
in a single disruption event are found to be correlated. The eccentricity of
the mutual orbits of captured/ejected binaries is typically excited to higher
values. Stellar evolution of captured/ejected binaries may later result in
their coalescence/strong interaction and the formation of hypervelocity blue
stragglers or merger remnants in orbits around SgrA*. Finally, the capture of
binaries close to the MBH can replenish and increase the binary frequency near
the MBH, which is otherwise very low.

two powerful tools to determine the protein 3D structure. However, not all
proteins can be successfully crystallized, particularly for membrane proteins.
Although NMR spectroscopy is indeed very powerful in determining the 3D
structures of membrane proteins, same as X-ray crystallography, it is still
very time-consuming and expensive. Under many circumstances, due to the
noncrystalline and insoluble nature of some proteins, X-ray and NMR cannot be
used at all. Computational approaches, however, allow us to obtain a
description of the protein 3D structure at a submicroscopic level.
  To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is little structural data
available to date on the AGAAAAGA palindrome in the hydrophobic region
(113-120) of prion proteins, which falls just within the N-terminal
unstructured region (1-123) of prion proteins. Many experimental studies have
shown that the AGAAAAGA region has amyloid fibril forming properties and plays
an important role in prion diseases. Due to the noncrystalline and insoluble
nature of the amyloid fibril, little structural data on the AGAAAAGA is
available. This paper introduces a simple molecular modelling strategy to
address the 3D atomic-resolution structure of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibrils.
Atomic-resolution structures of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibrils got in this
paper are useful for the drive to find treatments for prion diseases in the

  Porous Media",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The permeability of a porous medium is strongly affected by its local
geometry and connectivity, the size distribution of the solid inclusions and
the pores available for flow. Since direct measurements of the permeability are
time consuming and require experiments that are not always possible, the
reliable theoretical assessment of the permeability based on the medium
structural characteristics alone is of importance. When the porosity approaches
unity, the permeability-porosity relationships represented by the Kozeny-Carman
equations and Archie's law predict that permeability tends to infinity and thus
they yield unrealistic results if specific area of the porous media does not
tend to zero. The goal of this paper is an evaluation of the relationships
between porosity and permeability for a set of fractal models with porosity
approaching unity and a finite permeability. It is shown that the tube bundles
generated by finite iterations of the corresponding geometric fractals can be
used to model porous media where the permeability-porosity relationships are
derived analytically. Several examples of the tube bundles are constructed and
relevance of the derived permeability-porosity relationships is discussed in
connection with the permeability measurements of highly porous metal foams
reported in the literature.

applications in machine learning, economics, game theory, computer vision, and
many others. The general solver has a complexity of $O(n^3 \log^2 n . E +n^4
{\log}^{O(1)} n)$ where $E$ is the time required to evaluate the function and
$n$ is the number of variables \cite{Lee2015}. On the other hand, many computer
vision and machine learning problems are defined over special subclasses of
submodular functions that can be written as the sum of many submodular cost
functions defined over cliques containing few variables. In such functions, the
pseudo-Boolean (or polynomial) representation \cite{BorosH02} of these
subclasses are of degree (or order, or clique size) $k$ where $k \ll n$. In
this work, we develop efficient algorithms for the minimization of this useful
subclass of submodular functions. To do this, we define novel mapping that
transform submodular functions of order $k$ into quadratic ones. The underlying
idea is to use auxiliary variables to model the higher order terms and the
transformation is found using a carefully constructed linear program. In

allowing us to obtain a compact transformation using as few auxiliary variables

electrons on static disorder and its role in general picture of
Anderson-Hubbard metal-insulator transition, (3) electron-phonon interaction
and corresponding anomalies of electronic spectra in strongly correlated

mentioned interactions by introducing additional self-energy Sigma (in general
momentum dependent) into conventional DMFT scheme and calculated in a
self-consistent way within the standard set of DMFT equations. Here we
formulate general scheme of calculation of both one-particle (spectral
functions and densities of states) and two-particle (optical conductivity)
properties. We examine the problem of pseudogap formation, including the Fermi
arc formation and partial destruction of the Fermi surface, metal-insulator
transition in disordered Anderson-Hubbard model, and general picture of kink
formation within electronic spectra in strongly correlated systems. DMFT+Sigma
approach is generalized to describe realistic materials with strong
electron-electron correlations based on LDA+DMFT method. General scheme of
LDA+DMFT method is presented together with some of its applications to real

pairing strength between fermions from weak to strong in the particle-particle
channel. Here we study the effect of the particle-hole channel on the zero $T$
gap $\Delta(0)$, superfluid transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ and the
pseudogap at $T_{\text{c}}$, as well as the mean-field ratio
$2\Delta(0)/T_{\text{c}}^{\text{MF}}$, from BCS through BEC regimes, in the
framework of a pairing fluctuation theory which includes self-consistently the
contributions of finite-momentum pairs. These pairs necessarily lead to a
pseudogap in single particle excitation spectrum above and below
$T_{\text{c}}$. We sum over the infinite particle-hole ladder diagrams so that
the particle-particle and particle-hole $T$-matrices are entangled with each
other. We find that the particle-hole susceptibility has a complex dynamical
structure, with strong momentum and frequency dependencies, and is sensitive to
temperature, gap size and interaction strength. We conclude that neglecting the
self-energy feedback causes a serious over-estimate of the particle-hole
susceptibility. In the BCS limit, the particle-hole channel effect may be
approximated by the same reduction in the overall pairing strength so that the
ratio $2\Delta(0)/T_{\text{c}}$ is unaffected, in agreement with Gor'kov
\textit{et al.} to the leading order. However, the effect becomes more complex
and pronounced in the crossover regime, where the particle-hole susceptibility
is reduced by both a smaller Fermi surface and a big (pseudo)gap. Deep in the
BEC regime, the particle-hole channel contributions drop to zero. We propose
that precision measurements of the magnetic field for Feshbach resonance at low
temperatures as a function of density can be used to quantify the particle-hole
susceptibility and test different theories.

interesting problem is of extension a wave equation for Dirac--K\""{a}hler field

tensor formalism to a spinor one when these both are applied to description of

be equivalent and the tensor equations are derived from spinor ones. It is
shown that, for characterization of Dirac-K\""ahler's tensor components, two
alternative approaches are suitable: these are whether a tetrad-based pseudo
tensor classification or a generally coordinate pseudo tensor one. By imposing
definite restrictions on the the Dirac-K\""ahler function, we have produced the
general covariant form of wave equations for scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and

assuming the problem specific parameters remain unchanged during the
iterations. However, this assumption is unrealistic in time varying wireless
systems, as explicit message passing is usually involved in the iterations and
the channel state information (CSI) may change in a time scale comparable to
the algorithm update period. This paper investigates the convergence behavior
and the tracking error of primal-dual iterative algorithms under time varying

equivalent virtual dynamic system derived in the paper, and the Lyapunov theory
is applied for the stability analysis. We show that the average tracking error
is proportional to the time variation rate of the CSI. Based on these analyses,
we also derive an adaptive primal-dual algorithm by introducing a compensation

generation is decoupled from the other two in the charged lepton sector while
in the neutrino sector the third generation is decoupled from the first two
generations. The leptonic mixing in the symmetric limit can be, among other
structures, the bi-maximal (BM) or the tri-bimaximal (TBM) mixing. Symmetry
breaking effects are included both in the charged lepton and the neutrino
sector to produce corrections to the leptonic mixing and explain the recent
$\theta_{13}$ measurements. A model that extends the SM by three right handed
neutrinos, an extra Higgs doublet, and two singlet scalars is introduced to
generate the leptonic mixing.

and since the efficiency of most of the information processing systems is found
to be less, the potential of the Internet applications is often underutilized.
Efficient utilization of the web can be exploited when similar web pages are
rigorously, exhaustively organized and clustered based on some domain knowledge
(semantic-based) .Ontology which is a formal representation of domain knowledge
aids in such efficient utilization. The performance of almost all the
semantic-based clustering techniques depends on the constructed ontology,
describing the domain knowledge . The proposed methodology provides an enhanced
pronominal anaphora resolution, one of the key aspects of semantic analysis in
Natural Language Processing for obtaining cross references within a web page
providing better ontology construction. The experimental data sets exhibits
better efficiency of the proposed method compared to earlier traditional
algorithms.

quotient algebra without fixed basis. We present classification of Clifford
algebra elements based on the notion of quaternion type. This classification
allows us to reveal and prove a number of new properties of Clifford algebras.
We rely on the operations of conjugation to introduce the notion of quaternion
type. Also we find relations between the concepts of quaternion type and rank
of Clifford algebra element.

best way to generalize this curve to filling higher-dimensional spaces. We
argue that the properties that make Hilbert's curve unique in two dimensions,
are shared by 10694807 structurally different space-filling curves in three
dimensions. These include several curves that have, in some sense, better
locality properties than any generalized Hilbert curve that has been considered
in the literature before.
