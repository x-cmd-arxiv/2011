from a thick toroidal structure. The best studied such object is the small
radio and X-ray nebula around the Vela pulsar, which can be interpreted as the
result of interaction of a mildly supersonic inward flow with the recent pulsar
wind. Such a flow near the center of a supernova remnant can be produced in a
transient phase when the reverse shock reaches the center of the remnant. Other
nebulae with a thick toroidal structure are G106.6+2.9 and G76.9+1.0. Their
structure contrasts with young pulsar nebulae like the Crab Nebula and 3C 38,
which show a more chaotic, filamentary structure in the synchrotron emission.
In both situations, a torus-jet structure is present where the pulsar wind
passes through a termination shock, indicating the flow is initially toroidal.
We suggest that the difference is due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability that
operates when the outer boundary of the nebula is accelerating into freely
expanding supernova ejecta. The instability gives rise to mixing in the Crab
and related objects, but is not present in the nebulae with thick toroidal
regions.

introducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to the

from HST. We exploit deep WFC3 IR observations of the ERS and HUDF fields over
GOODS-South, combined with HST-ACS optical data, to select z~4 LBGs through a
new (B-V) vs. (V-H) colour diagram. The UV slope of the selected galaxies is
robustly determined by a linear fit over their observed I, Z, Y, J magnitudes,
coherently with the original definition of beta. The same fit is used to
determine their rest-frame UV magnitudes M1600 through a simple interpolation.
We estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulations
that we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, to
constrain the probability density function of UV slopes PDF(beta) as a function
of rest-frame magnitude. We find 142 and 25 robust LBGs in the ERS and HUDF
fields respectively, limiting our sample to S/N(H)>10 objects. Our newly
defined criteria improve the selection of z~4 LBGs and allow us to exclude red
interlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. We find that z~4
LBGs are characterized by blue UV slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: all
L<L* galaxies have an average UV slope <beta>\simeq-2.1, while brighter objects
only are slightly redder (<beta> -1.9). We find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3
for PDF(beta) at all magnitudes. The SFRD at z~4 corrected according to these
estimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(SFRD)\simeq-1.09
M_sun/yr/Mpc^3. Finally, we discuss how the UV slope of z~4 galaxies changes as
a function of the dust-corrected UV magnitude (i.e. SFR) showing that most
galaxies with a high SFR (> 80 M_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.

refinement-based approach to automated modelling, where a user specifies a
problem in an abstract constraint specification language and it is then
automatically refined into a constraint model. In particular, we revisit the
Conjure system that first appeared in prototype form in 2005 and present a new
implementation with a much greater coverage of the specification language

instead of LOCC operations we consider k-extendible operations, defined as maps
whose Choi-Jamiolkowski state is k-extendible. We find that this class is
unexpectedly powerful - e.g. it is capable of distilling EPR pairs even from
product states. We also perform numerical studies of distillation of Werner

constraints on the components of the metric tensor and also on the functional
form of admissible coordinate transformations. These two sets of constraints
are equivalent and represent the dual nature of the harmonic gauge. We explore
this duality and show that the harmonic gauge allows presenting an accelerated
metric in an elegant form that depends only on two harmonic potentials. It also
allows reconstruction of the spatial structure of the post-Galilean coordinate
transformation functions relating inertial and accelerating frames. The
remaining temporal dependence of these functions together with corresponding
equations of motion are determined from dynamical conditions, obtained by
constructing the relativistic proper reference frame of an accelerated test
particle. In this frame, the effect of external forces acting on the observer
is balanced by the fictitious frame-reaction force that is needed to keep the
test particle at rest with respect to the frame, conserving its relativistic
linear momentum. We find that this approach is sufficient to determine all the
terms of the coordinate transformation. The same method is then used to develop
the inverse transformations. The resulting post-Galilean coordinate
transformations extend the Poincar\'e group on the case of accelerating
observers. We present and discuss the resulting coordinate transformations,
relativistic equations of motion, and the structure of the metric tensors

the recently unveiled spin-orthogonal-stripe states and their associated high
degeneracy. This new state complements the long-standing scenario of phase
separation, since the alternating FM-CE pattern appears even in the present
study which is carried out in the clean limit. The present and recent
investigations are also in agreement with the many ""glassy"" characteristics of
the CMR state found experimentally, due to the high degeneracy of the

incompressible fluid in a uniform gravitational field, lying above a general
rigid bottom in a three-dimensional horizontally periodic setting. We establish
the global well-posedness of the problem both with and without surface tension.
We prove that without surface tension the solution decays to the equilibrium
state at an almost exponential rate; with surface tension, we show that the
solution decays at an exponential rate. Our results include the case in which a
heavier fluid lies above a lighter one, provided that the surface tension at
the free internal interface is above a critical value, which we identify. This
means that sufficiently large surface tension stabilizes the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability in the nonlinear setting. As a part of our analysis, we establish
elliptic estimates for the two-phase stationary Stokes problem.

the past one half year there have been new results concerning the existence of
WIMPs at low mass including the new XENON 100, 100-day data, additional CDMS
results, the publication of annual variation data from LVD and Borexino and new
CoGeNT data. Along with the S2 analyses of the XENON 10 data we provide an
overview of this situation. We discuss new results from 2011 here. We also
discuss the origin of annual variations of signals in underground laboratories.
This article is meant to be an update of recent experimental results. It is not
a critical comparison of the claims of various experimental groups. Such
critiques are made in public conferences and meetings. There is currently an
intense discussion being carried out about the low mass WIMP region with many
different viewpoints. We have little to say about this situation except that
the scientific method usually insures the correct results will eventually
surface.

satisfying a prescribed survivability criterion. The survivability criterion
requires that a feasible flow must still exists (i.e. all demands can be
satisfied without violating arc capacities) even after the disruption of a
subset of the network's arcs. Specifically, we consider the case in which a
disruption (random or malicious) can destroy a subset of the arcs, with the
cost of the disruption not to exceed a disruption budget. This problem takes
the form of a tri-level, two-player game, in which the network operator designs
(or augments) the network, then the attacker launches a disruption that
destroys a subset of arcs, and then the network operator attempts to find a
feasible flow over the residual network. We first show how this can be modeled
as a two-stage stochastic program from the network operator's perspective, with
each of the exponential number of potential attacks considered as a disruption
scenario. We then reformulate this problem, via a Benders decomposition, to
consider the recourse decisions implicitly, greatly reducing the number of
variables but at the expense of an exponential increase in the number of
constraints. We next develop a cut-generation based algorithm. Rather than
\emph{explicitly} considering each disruption scenario to identify these
Benders cuts, however, we develop a bi-level program and corresponding
separation algorithm that enables us to \emph{implicitly} evaluate the
exponential set of disruption scenarios. Our computational results demonstrate
the efficacy of this approach.

systems with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Observations were taken in
transit and out of transit, and we analyzed the differenced spectra---i.e., the
transmission spectra---to inspect it for absorption at the wavelengths of the
neutral sodium (\ion{Na}{1}) doublet at $\lambda\lambda5889, 5895$ and neutral
potassium (\ion{K}{1}) at $\lambda7698$. We used the transmission spectrum at
\ion{Ca}{1} $\lambda6122$---which shows strong stellar absorption but is not an
alkali metal resonance line that we expect to show significant absorption in
these atmospheres---as a control line to examine our measurements for
systematic errors. We use an empirical Monte Carlo method to quantity these
systematic errors. In a reanalysis of the same dataset using a reduction and
analysis pipeline that was derived independently, we confirm the previously
seen \ion{Na}{1} absorption in HD 189733b at a level of
$(-5.26\pm1.69)\times10^{-4}$ (the average value over a 12 \AA{} integration
band to be consistent with previous authors). Additionally, we tentatively
confirm the \ion{Na}{1} absorption seen in HD 209458b (independently by
multiple authors) at a level of $(-2.63\pm0.81)\times10^{-4}$, though the
interpretation is less clear. Furthermore, we find \ion{Na}{1} absorption of
$(-3.16\pm2.06)\times10^{-4}$ at $<3\sigma$ in HD 149026b; features apparent in
the transmission spectrum are consistent with real absorption and indicate this
may be a good target for future observations to confirm. No other results
(\ion{Na}{1} in HD 147506b and \ion{Ca}{1} and \ion{K}{1} in all four targets)
are significant to $\geq 3\sigma$, although we observe some features that we
argue are primarily artifacts.

modules initiated in [PZ2]. Generalized Harish-Chandra modules are
(g,k)-modules of finite type where g is a semisimple Lie algebra and k \subset
g is a reductive in g subalgebra. A first result of the present paper is that a
fundamental series module is a g-module of finite length. We then define the
notions of strongly and weakly reconstructible simple (g,k)-modules M which
reflect to what extent M can be determined via its appearance in the socle of a
fundamental series module.
  In the second part of the paper we concentrate on the case k \simeq sl(2) and
prove a sufficient condition for strong reconstructibility. This strengthens
our main result from [PZ2] for the case k = sl(2). We also compute the
sl(2)-characters of all simple strongly reconstructible (and some weakly
reconstructible) (g,sl(2))-modules. We conclude the paper by discussing a
functor between a generalization of the category O and a category of
(g,sl(2))-modules, and we conjecture that this functor is an equivalence of
categories.

the scientific research lifecycle. In field-based research, contextual
information provides a detailed description of scientific practices and thus
enables data interpretation and reuse. For field data, losing contextual
information often means losing the data altogether. Yet, documenting the
context of distributed, collaborative, field-based research can be a
significant challenge due to the unpredictable nature of real-world settings
and to the high degree of variability in data collection methods and scientific
practices of different researchers. In this article, we propose the use of
microblogging as a mechanism to support collection, ingestion, and publication
of contextual information about the variegated digital artifacts that are
produced in field research. We perform interviews with scholars involved in
field-based environmental and urban sensing research, to determine the extent
of adoption of Twitter and similar microblogging platforms and their potential
use for field-specific research applications. Based on the results of these
interviews as well as participant observation of field activities, we present
the design, development, and pilot evaluation of a microblogging application
integrated with an existing data collection platform on a handheld device. We
investigate whether microblogging accommodates the variable and unpredictable
nature of highly mobile research and whether it represents a suitable mechanism
to document the context of field research data early in the scientific
information lifecycle.

as astrophysical and cosmological stochastic backgrounds. Since the relative
strength and angular distribution of the many possible sources of GWs are not
well constrained, searches for GW signals must be performed in a
model-independent way. To that end we perform two directional searches for
persistent GWs using data from the LIGO S5 science run: one optimized for
pointlike sources and one for arbitrary extended sources. The latter result is
the first of its kind. Finding no evidence to support the detection of GWs, we
present 90% confidence level (CL) upper-limit maps of GW strain power with
typical values between 2-20x10^-50 strain^2 Hz^-1 and 5-35x10^-49 strain^2
Hz^-1 sr^-1 for pointlike and extended sources respectively. The limits on
pointlike sources constitute a factor of 30 improvement over the previous best
limits. We also set 90% CL limits on the narrow-band root-mean-square GW strain
from interesting targets including Sco X-1, SN1987A and the Galactic Center as
low as ~7x10^-25 in the most sensitive frequency range near 160 Hz. These
limits are the most constraining to date and constitute a factor of 5
improvement over the previous best limits.

data and at V2 between 74-92 AU and also at V1 beyond the heliospheric
termination shock (91-113 AU). The correlation coefficient between the
intensities at the Earth and at V1 during this time period is remarkable
(0.921), after allowing for a ~0.9 year delay due to the solar wind propagation
time from the Earth to the outer heliosphere. To describe the intensity changes
and to predict the absolute intensities measured at all three locations we have
used a simple spherically symmetric (no drift) two-zone heliospheric transport
model with specific values for the diffusion coefficient in both the inner and
outer zones. The diffusion coefficient in the outer zone, assumed to be the
heliosheath from about 90 to 120 (130) AU, is determined to be ~5 times smaller
than that in the inner zone out to 90 AU. This means the Heliosheath acts much
like a diffusing barrier in this model. The absolute magnitude of the
intensities and the intensity changes at V1 and the Earth are described to
within a few percent by a diffusion coefficient that varies with time by a
factor ~4 in the inner zone and only a factor of ~1.5 in the outer zone over
the time period from 2004-2010. For V2 the observed intensities follow a curve
that is as much as 25% higher than the calculated intensities at the V2 radius
and at times the observed V2 intensities are equal to those at V1. At least
one-half of the difference between the calculated and observed intensities
between V1 and V2 can be explained if the heliosphere is squashed by ~10% in
distance (non-spherical) so that the HTS location is closer to the Sun in the
direction of V2 compared to V1.

solution to the three-dimensional dissipative incompressible

mechanism behind the cycle and show that it results from a combination of
linear and nonlinear interactions between a large-scale axisymmetric toroidal
magnetic field and non-axisymmetric perturbations amplified by the
magnetorotational instability. We demonstrate that this large scale dynamo
mechanism is overall intrinsically nonlinear and not reducible to the standard
mean-field dynamo formalism. Our results therefore provide clear evidence for a
generic nonlinear generation mechanism of time-dependent coherent large-scale
magnetic fields in shear flows and call for new theoretical dynamo models.
These findings may offer important clues to understand the transitional and
statistical properties of subcritical magnetorotational turbulence.

coefficients which are determined by matching with the finite-difference

the singular-value decomposition. Here a more efficient method to achieve the

finite-difference solutions with spherical harmonic functions taken over a
spherical surface concentric with the particle. The new approach is tested on a

system, A0620-00. Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space
Telescope, we have obtained the first FUV spectrum of A0620-00. The observed
spectrum is flat in the FUV and very faint (with continuum fluxes \simeq 1e -
17 ergs/cm^2/s/A). We compiled the dereddened, broadband spectral energy
distribution of A0620-00 and compared it to previous SEDs as well as
theoretical models. The SEDs show that the source varies at all wavelengths for
which we have multiple samples. Contrary to previous observations, the
optical-UV spectrum does not continue to drop to shorter wavelengths, but
instead shows a recovery and an increasingly blue spectrum in the FUV. We
created an optical-UV spectrum of A0620-00 with the donor star contribution
removed. The non-stellar spectrum peaks at \simeq3000 {\deg}A. The peak can be
fit with a T=10,000 K blackbody with a small emitting area, probably
originating in the hot spot where the accretion stream impacts the outer disk.
However, one or more components in addition to the blackbody are needed to fit
the FUV upturn and the red optical fluxes in the optical-UV spectrum. By
comparing the mass accretion rate determined from the hot spot luminosity to
the mean accretion rate inferred from the outburst history, we find that the
latter is an order of magnitude smaller than the former, indicating that
\sim90% of the accreted mass must be lost from the system if the predictions of
the disk instability model and the estimated interoutburst interval are
correct. The mass accretion rate at the hot spot is 10^5 the accretion rate at
the black hole inferred from the X-ray luminosity. To reconcile these requires
that outflows carry away virtually all of the accreted mass, a very low rate of
mass transfer from the outer cold disk into the inner hot region, and/or
radiatively inefficient accretion.

signature of the transition is the change of sign of the chemical potential,
being negative in the normal phase and becoming positive in the quantum fluid
phase. We show that this change is characterized by a phenomenon that we call
condensation, in which a macroscopic number of particles is in their own
many-body ground state, a situation common to Fermi and Bose gases. We show
that the ideal Bose-Einstein Condensation fits in this scenario, but that it
also permits the occurrence of a situation that we may call ""Fermi-Dirac
Condensation"". In addition, we argue that this phenomenon is also behind the
development of superfluid phases in real interacting fluids. However, only
interacting systems may show the change from a thermal fluid to a quantum one
as a true phase transition. As a corollary, this argument shows the necessity
of the appearance of a ""supersolid"" phase. We also indicate how these ideas may
be useful in the description of of experiments with ultracold alkali gases.

star-formation intensities they maintain over tens of kiloparsecs at levels
that are only observed in the nearby Universe in the most powerful nuclear
starbursts. To investigate how these high star-formation intensities affect the
warm ionized medium, we present an analysis of the average spectra of about 50
such galaxies at z~1.2-2.6 and of subsamples selected according to their local
and global star-formation intensity. Stacking allows us to probe relatively
weak lines like [SII]\lambda \lambda 6716,6731 and [OI]\lambda 6300, which are
tracers of the conditions of the ISM and are undetectable in most individual
targets. We find higher gas densities (hence pressures) in intensely
star-forming regions compared to fainter diffuse gas and, overall, values that
are comparable to starburst regions and the diffuse ISM in nearby galaxies. By
modeling the H\alpha\ surface brightnesses and [SII]/H\alpha\ line ratios with
the Cloudy photoionization code, we find that our galaxies continue trends
observed in local galaxies, where gas pressures scale with star-formation
intensity. We discuss these results in the context of models of self-regulated
star formation, where star formation determines the average thermal and
turbulent pressure in the ISM, which in turn determines the rate at which stars
can form, finding good agreement with our data. We also confirm the detection
of broad, faint lines underlying H\alpha\ and [NII], which have previously been
considered evidence of either outflows or active galactic nuclei. Finding that
the broad component is only significantly detected in stacks with the highest
average local and global star-formation intensities strongly supports the
outflow interpretation, and further emphasizes the importance of star-formation
feedback and self-regulation in the early Universe.

asymmetry in B_d,s-meson samples and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in B_s ->
J/psi phi depart from their standard model (SM) predictions. This could be an
indication for new CP phases in Delta B = 2 transitions, preferentially in
B_s-Bbar_s mixing. The experimental situation, however, remained inconclusive,
as it favored values of the element Gamma_12^s of the decay matrix in the
B_s-meson system that are notably different from the SM expectation, suggesting
the presence of new physics in the Delta B = 1 sector as well. The very recent
LHCb measurements of B_s -> J/psi phi and B_s -> J/psi f_0, which do not find
any evidence for a new-physics phase in the element M_12^s of the mass matrix,
point into this direction as well. In this article, we explore the potential
size of non-standard effects in Gamma_12^s stemming from dimension-six
operators with flavor content (sbar b) (taubar tau). We show that since the
existing constraints imposed by tree- and loop-level mediated B_d,s-meson
decays are quite loose, absorptive new physics of this type can in part explain
the current data. Our model-independent conclusions are finally contrasted with
explicit analyses of the new-physics effects in B_s-Bbar_s mixing that can
arise from leptoquarks or Z' bosons.

characterized by intermediate spectral indices consistent with hypercompact

optically thick HC HII region, is detected only at 1.3 cm and is associated
with hot core line emission and water and 6.7 GHz methanol masers. The results
of our exceptionally sensitive survey indicate that EGOs signify an early stage
of massive star formation, before photoionizing feedback from the central MYSO

outflows (and so, presumably, actively accreting), the surveyed EGOs are

matched narrow-band filters in the H and z' bands), exploiting synergies
between the UKIRT and Subaru telescopes. The Ha survey at z=1.47 reaches a flux
limit of ~7x10^-17 erg/s/cm^2 and detects ~200 Ha emitters over 0.7deg^2, while
the much deeper [OII] survey reaches an effective flux of ~7x10^-18 erg/s/cm^2,
detecting ~1400 z=1.47 [OII] emitters in a matched co-moving volume of

simultaneous Ha and [OII] emitters at z=1.47. Ha and [OII] luminosity functions
are derived and both are shown to evolve significantly from z~0 in a consistent
way. The star formation rate density of the Universe at z=1.47 is evaluated,
with the Ha analysis yielding 0.16+-0.05 M_sun/yr/Mpc^3 and the [OII] analysis
0.17+-0.04 M_sun/yr/Mpc^3. The measurements are combined with other studies,
providing a self-consistent measurement of the star formation history of the
Universe over the last ~11Gyrs. By using a large comparison sample at z~0.1
(from the SDSS), [OII]/Ha line ratios are calibrated as probes of
dust-extinction. Ha emitters at z~1.47 show on average 1 mag of extinction at
Ha, similar to the SDSS sources at z~0. Although we find that dust extinction
correlates with SFR, the relation evolves by about ~0.5 mag from z~1.5 to z~0,
with z~0 relations over-predicting the dust extinction corrections at high-z by
that amount. Stellar mass is found to be a much more fundamental extinction
predictor, with the relation between mass and extinction being valid at both
z~0 and z~1.5. Dust extinction corrections as a function of optical colours are
also derived, offering simpler mechanisms for estimating extinction in

complicated by uncertainties in the spatial distribution of the gas, the
time-variability of the source, and the comparison of observations across a
wide range of wavelengths. Some of these challenges can be mitigated with
far-ultraviolet spectroscopy. Using new observations obtained with the
HST-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, we measure column densities and rovibrational
temperatures for CO and H2 observed on the line-of-sight through the AA Tauri
circumstellar disk. CO A-X absorption bands are observed against the far-UV
continuum. The CO absorption is characterized by log(N(^{12}CO)) = 17.5 +/- 0.5
cm^{-2} and T_rot(CO) = 500$^{+500}_{-200} K, although this rotational
temperature may underestimate the local kinetic temperature of the CO-bearing
gas. We also detect ^{13}CO in absorption with an isotopic ratio of ~20. We do
not observe H2 absorption against the continuum; however, hot H2 (v > 0) is
detected in absorption against the LyA emission line. We measure the column
densities in eight individual rovibrational states, determining a total
log(N(H2)) = 17.9^{+0.6}_{-0.3} cm^{-2} with a thermal temperature of T(H2) =
2500^{+800}_{-700} K. The high-temperature of the molecules, the relatively
small H2 column density, and the high-inclination of the AA Tauri disk suggest
that the absorbing gas resides in an inner disk atmosphere. If the H2 and CO
are co-spatial within a molecular layer ~ 0.6 AU thick, this region is
characterized by <n_H2> ~ 10^{5} cm^{-3} with an observed <CO/H2> ratio of ~
0.4. We also find evidence for a departure from a purely thermal H2
distribution, suggesting that excitation by continuum photons and H2 formation
may be altering the level populations in the molecular gas.

CPT conservation and the unitarity of S-matrix require that the lowest order
contribution that leads to the generation of a non-zero net CP-violation via
the decay of a heavy particle must be to $\mathcal{O}({\alpha_\slashed{B}}^3)$,
where $\alpha_\slashed{B}$ is a baryon number (B) violating coupling. We
revisit this theorem (which holds for lepton number (L) violation, and hence
for leptogenesis as well) and examine its implications for models where the
particle content allows the heavy particle to also decay via modes which
conserve B (or L) in addition to modes which do not. We systematically expand
the S-matrix order by order in B\slash L-violating couplings, and show, in such
cases, that the net CP-violation is non-zero even to
$\mathcal{O}({\alpha_\slashed{B}}^2)$, without actually contradicting the
theorem. By replacing a B/L violating coupling (usually constrained to be
small) by a relatively unconstrained B/L conserving one, our result may allow
for sufficient CP violation in models where it may otherwise have been
difficult to generate the observed baryon asymmetry. As an explicit application
of this result, we construct a model in low-scale leptogenesis.

time-averaged peak energy in both classes of bursts. The peak energy evolution,
as a function of time, tracks the evolution of the flux on short timescales in
both short and long GRBs. We do not find evidence of an hard-to-soft spectral

during most of their evolution, long GRBs can start with a softer peak energy
(of few hundreds keV) and become as hard as short ones (i.e. with Ep,obs larger

measured redshift. In these few cases we find that their correlations between
the rest frame Ep and the luminosity Liso are less scattered than their
correlations in the observer frame between the peak energy Ep,obs and the flux

=16:40:55.57, delta =-53:45:05.2 (J2000; 1 sigma positional uncertainty of ~
0.3 arcsec) which is consistent with the known optical position of 4U 1636-53;
its magnitude is K_s = 16.14 +- 0.12. This star is also detected in the 2MASS

that the persistent emission is largely unvarying, the 0.4-2.2 micron
de-reddened SED can be described by a power law; F_nu propto nu^(1.5 +- 0.3),
with some possible curvature (F_nu propto nu^(<= 1.5)) at 0.2-0.4 microns. The
SED can be approximated by a blackbody of temperature ~ 27 000 K. This is
typical for an active low-mass X-ray binary, and the emission can be explained
by the outer regions of a (likely irradiated) accretion disc. We therefore
interpret this K_s-band star as the NIR counterpart.

  Until now these properties focused on advantages of classical Linkage-Based

continuum variations and a suitable band, usually a narrow band (NB), to trace
the echo of an emission line in the broad line region (BLR). The narrow band
catches both the emission line and the underlying continuum, and one needs to
extract the pure emission line light curve. We performed a test on two local
AGNs, PG0003+199 (=Mrk335) and Ark120, observing well-sampled broad- (B, V) and
narrow-band light curves with the robotic 15cm telescope VYSOS-6 on Cerro
Armazones, Chile. In PG0003+199, H_alpha dominates the flux in the NB by 85%,
allowing us to measure the time lag of H_alpha against B without the need to
correct for the continuum contribution. In Ark120, H_beta contributes only 50%
to the flux in the NB. The cross correlation of the B and NB light curves shows
two distinct peaks of similar strength, one at lag zero from the autocorrelated
continuum and one from the emission line at tau_cent = 47.5 +/- 3.4 days. We
constructed a synthetic H_beta light curve, by subtracting a scaled V light
curve, which traces the continuum, from the NB light curve. The cross
correlation of this synthetic H_beta light curve with the B light curve shows
only one major peak at tau_cent = 48.0 +/- 3.3 days, while the peak from the
autocorrelated continuum at lag zero is absent. We conclude that, as long as
the emission line contributes at least 50% to the bandpass, the pure emission
line light curve can be reconstructed from photometric monitoring data so that
the time lag can be measured. For both objects the lags we find are consistent
with spectroscopic reverberation results. While the dense sampling (median 2
days) enables us to determine tau_cent with small (10%) formal errors, we
caution that gaps in the light curves may lead to much larger systematic
uncertainties. (Abstract shortened, see the manuscript.)

evidence shows that VVV CL002 is a newly discovered, small, moderately
metal-rich (Fe/H -0.4) Galactic GC. It is located at a Galactocentric distance
of 0.7+-0.9 kpc, and it could be one of the nearest GC to the Galactic center.
Its characteristics are more similar to those of low-mass, Palomar-like GCs
than to more classical, old, and massive bulge GCs. VVV CL003 is the first star
cluster discovered in the Galactic disk on the opposite side of the center with
respect to the Sun, at a Galactocentric distance of ~5 kpc. Its high
metallicity (Fe/H -0.1) and location point to an open cluster, but a GC cannot
be excluded. VVV CL004, on the contrary, is most probably only a random clump
of field stars, as indicated by both its low statistical significance and by
the impossibility to distinguish its stars from the surrounding field
population. We claim the detection of i) a new Galactic GC, deriving an
estimate of its basic parameters; ii) a stellar aggregate, probably an open

the finite temperature phase boundary near the quantum critical point

was the centerpiece of the world's high energy physics program - beginning
operation in December of 1985 until it was overtaken by LHC in 2011. The aim of
this unique scientific instrument was to explore the elementary particle
physics reactions with center of mass collision energies of up to 1.96 TeV. The
initial design luminosity of the Tevatron was 1030cm-2s-1, however as a result
of two decades of upgrades, the accelerator has been able to deliver 430 times
higher luminosities to each of two high luminosity experiments, CDF and D0. The
Tevatron will be shut off September 30, 2011. The collider was arguably one of
the most complex research instruments ever to reach the operation stage and is
widely recognized for many technological breakthroughs and numerous physics
discoveries. In this John Adams lecture, I briefly present the history of the
Tevatron, major advances in accelerator physics, and technology implemented
during the long quest for better and better performance. Lessons learned from
our experience are also discussed.

  Lightfields and Higher Dimensional Visual Signals","Draft of working paper",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computational photography involves sophisticated capture methods. A new trend
is to capture projection of higher dimensional visual signals such as videos,
multi-spectral data and lightfields on lower dimensional sensors. Carefully
designed capture methods exploit the sparsity of the underlying signal in a
transformed domain to reduce the number of measurements and use an appropriate
reconstruction method. Traditional progressive methods may capture successively
more detail using a sequence of simple projection basis, such as DCT or
wavelets and employ straightforward backprojection for reconstruction.
Randomized projection methods do not use any specific sequence and use L0
minimization for reconstruction. In this paper, we analyze the statistical
properties of natural images, videos, multi-spectral data and light-fields and
compare the effectiveness of progressive and random projections. We define
effectiveness by plotting reconstruction SNR against compression factor. The
key idea is a procedure to measure best-case effectiveness that is fast,
independent of specific hardware and independent of the reconstruction
procedure. We believe this is the first empirical study to compare different
lossy capture strategies without the complication of hardware or reconstruction
ambiguity. The scope is limited to linear non-adaptive sensing. The results
show that random projections produce significant advantages over other
projections only for higher dimensional signals, and suggest more research to
nascent adaptive and non-linear projection methods.

presented. Clear mathematical foundations are still lacking for this quantum
walk model. As a step towards this objective, the following question is being
addressed: {\it Given a graph, what is the probability that a quantum walk
arrives at a given vertex after some number of steps?} This is a very natural
question, and for random walks it can be answered by several different
combinatorial arguments. For quantum walks this is a highly non-trivial task.
Furthermore, this was only achieved before for one specific coin operator
(Hadamard operator) for walks on the line. Even considering only walks on
lines, generalizing these computations to a general SU(2) coin operator is a
complex task. The main contribution is a closed-form formula for the amplitudes
of the state of the walk (which includes the question above) for a general
symmetric SU(2) operator for walks on the line. To this end, a coin operator
with parameters that alters the phase of the state of the walk is defined.
Then, closed-form solutions are computed by means of Fourier analysis and
asymptotic approximation methods. We also present some basic properties of the
walk which can be deducted using weak convergence theorems for quantum walks.
In particular, the support of the induced probability distribution of the walk
is calculated. Then, it is shown how changing the parameters in the coin
operator affects the resulting probability distribution.

precision spectroscopy due to its ability to provide a precise and direct link
between microwave and optical frequencies. A novel application of frequency
comb technology that leverages both the ultrashort duration of each laser pulse
and the exquisite phase coherence of a train of pulses is the generation of
frequency combs in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) via high harmonic generation
(HHG) in a femtosecond enhancement cavity. Until now, this method has lacked
sufficient average power for applications, which has also hampered efforts to
observe phase coherence of the high-repetition rate pulse train produced in the
extremely nonlinear HHG process. Hence, the existence of a frequency comb in
the XUV has not been confirmed. We have overcome both challenges. Here, we
present generation of >200 {\mu}W per harmonic reaching 50 nm, and the
observation of single-photon spectroscopy signals for both an argon transition
at 82 nm and a neon transition at 63 nm. The absolute frequency of the argon
transition has been determined via direct frequency comb spectroscopy. The
resolved 10-MHz linewidth of the transition, limited by the transverse
temperature of the argon atoms, is unprecedented in this spectral region and
places a stringent upper limit on the linewidth of individual comb teeth. Due
to the lack of cw lasers, these frequency combs are currently the only
promising avenue towards extending ultrahigh precision spectroscopy to below
the 100-nm spectral region with a wide range of applications that include
spectroscopy of electronic transitions in molecules, experimental tests of
bound state and many body quantum electrodynamics in He+ and He, development of
next-generation ""nuclear"" clocks, and searches for spatial and temporal

Friedman-Robertson-Walker background in which a number of randomly distributed
non-overlapping spherical regions are replaced by mass compensating comoving
voids, each with a uniform density interior and a thin shell of matter on the
surface. We compute the distribution of magnitude shifts using a variant of the
method of Holz & Wald (1998), which includes the effect of lensing shear. The
standard deviation of this distribution is ~ 0.027 magnitudes and the mean is ~
0.003 magnitudes for voids of radius 35 Mpc, sources at redshift z_s=1.0, with
the voids chosen so that 90% of the mass is on the shell today. The standard
deviation varies from 0.005 to 0.06 magnitudes as we vary the void size, source
redshift, and fraction of mass on the shells today. If the shell walls are
given a finite thickness of ~ 1 Mpc, the standard deviation is reduced to ~
0.013 magnitudes. This standard deviation due to voids is a factor ~ 3 smaller
than that due to galaxy scale structures. We summarize our results in terms of
a fitting formula that is accurate to ~ 20%, and also build a simplified
analytic model that reproduces our results to within ~ 30%. Our model also
allows us to explore the domain of validity of weak lensing theory for voids.
We find that for 35 Mpc voids, corrections to the dispersion due to lens-lens
coupling are of order ~ 4%, and corrections to due shear are ~ 3%. Finally, we
estimate the bias due to source-lens clustering in our model to be negligible.

between an atom and a perfectly conducting disc. We consider the atom in the
symmetry axis of the disc and assume the atom is predominantly polarizable in
the direction of this axis. For this situation we discuss the finite size
effects on the corresponding interaction energy. We follow the recent procedure
introduced by Eberlein and Zietal together with the old and powerful
Sommerfeld's image method for non-trivial geometries. For the sake of clarity
we present a detailed discussion of Sommerfeld's image method. Comparing our
results form the atom-disc system with those recently obtained for an atom near
a conducting plane with a circular aperture, we discus the non-additivity of
the van der Waals interactions involving an atom and two complementary
surfaces. We show that there is a given ratio z/a between the distance z from
the atom to the center of the disc (aperture) and the radius of the disc a
(aperture) for which non-additivity effects vanish. Qualitative arguments
suggest that this quite unexpected result will occur not only for a circular
hole, but for anyother symmetric hole.

distortions (RSD), in which the redshift space density can be written as a sum
over velocity moments of the distribution function. These moments are density
weighted and their lowest orders are density, momentum density, and stress
energy density. The series expansion is convergent on large scales. We perform
an expansion of these velocity moments into helicity modes, which are
eigenmodes under rotation around the axis of Fourier mode direction,
generalizing the scalar, vector, tensor decomposition of perturbations to an
arbitrary order. We show that only equal helicity moments correlate and derive
the angular dependence of the individual contributions to the redshift space
power spectrum in terms of angle mu between wave vector and line of sight. We
show that the dominant term of mu^2 dependence on large scales is the
cross-correlation between the density and scalar part of momentum density,
which can be related to the time derivative of the matter power spectrum.
Additional terms contributing and dominating on small scales are the vector
part of momentum density-momentum density correlations, the energy
density-density correlations, and the scalar part of anisotropic stress
density-density correlations. Similarly, we identify 7 terms contributing to
mu^4 dependence. Some of the advantages of the distribution function approach
are that the series expansion converges on large scales and remains valid in
multi-stream situations. We finish with a brief discussion of implications for
RSD in galaxies relative to dark matter, highlighting the issue of scale
dependent bias of velocity moments correlators.

Architecture defines the form and function of the systems in a project or

business alignments. Application-specific Architecture defines the form and
function of the applications that will be developed to realize functionality of
the system with narrow scope and technical alignments. Because of the magnitude
and complexity of any enterprise integration project, a major engineering and
operations planning effort must be accomplished prior to any actual integration
work. As the needs and the requirements vary depending on their volume, the
entire enterprise problem can be broken into chunks of manageable pieces. These
pieces can be implemented and tested individually with high integration effort.
Therefore it becomes essential to analyze the economic and technical
feasibility of realizable enterprise solution. It is difficult to migrate from
one technological and business aspect to other as the enterprise evolves. The
existing process models in system engineering emphasize on life-cycle
management and low-level activity coordination with milestone verification.
Many organizations are developing enterprise architecture to provide a clear
vision of how systems will support and enable their business. The paper
proposes an approach for selection of suitable enterprise architecture
depending on the measurement framework. The framework consists of unique
combination of higher order goals, non-functional requirement support and
inputs-outcomes pair evaluation. The earlier efforts in this regard were
concerned about only custom scales indicating the availability of a parameter

connected to the problem of decoding messages in a Single-Input Multiple-Output
(SIMO) multiple access channel (MAC), thereby enabling an information theoretic
framework for analyzing performance limits in recovering the support of sparse
signals. Sharp sufficient and necessary conditions for successful support
recovery are derived in terms of the number of measurements per measurement
vector, the number of nonzero rows, the measurement noise level, and especially
the number of measurement vectors. Through the interpretations of the results,
in particular the connection to the multiple output communication system, the
benefit of having MMV for sparse signal recovery is illustrated providing a
theoretical foundation to the performance improvement enabled by MMV as
observed in many existing simulation results. In particular, it is shown that
the structure (rank) of the matrix formed by the nonzero entries plays an
important role on the performance limits of support recovery.

of plates of thickness $2\delta$ when $\delta\to 0$. This study is carried on
within the frame of linear elasticity by using the unfolding method. It is
based on several decompositions of the structure displacements and on the
passing to the limit in fixed domains. We begin with studying the displacements
of a plate. We show that any displacement is the sum of an elementary
displacement concerning the normal lines on the middle surface of the plate and
a residual displacement linked to these normal lines deformations. An
elementary displacement is linear with respect to the variable $x$3. It is
written $U(^x)+R(^x)\land x3e3$ where U is a displacement of the mid-surface of
the plate. We show a priori estimates and convergence results when $\delta \to
0$. We characterize the limits of the unfolded displacements of a plate as well
as the limits of the unfolded of the strained tensor. Then we extend these
results to the structures made of plates. We show that any displacement of a
structure is the sum of an elementary displacement of each plate and of a
residual displacement. The elementary displacements of the structure (e.d.p.s.)
coincide with elementary rods displacements in the junctions. Any e.d.p.s. is
given by two functions belonging to $H1(S;R3)$ where S is the skeleton of the
structure (the plates mid-surfaces set). One of these functions : U is the
skeleton displacement. We show that U is the sum of an extensional displacement
and of an inextensional one. The first one characterizes the membrane
displacements and the second one is a rigid displacement in the direction of
the plates and it characterizes the plates flexion. Eventually we pass to the
limit as $\delta \to 0$ in the linearized elasticity system, on the one hand we
obtain a variational problem that is satisfied by the limit extensional
displacement, and on the other hand, a variational problem satisfied by the
limit of inextensional displacements.

muas sources and < 250 pc away for ~ 10 muas sources. We attribute the scarcity
of rapid and large amplitude scintillators to the requirement of additional
constraints, including large source compact fractions. J1819+3845 was found to
display ~ 2% rms variations at ~ 6 hour time-scales superposed on longer > 11

rods of thickness 2\delta when \delta rightarrow 0. This study is carried on
within the frame of linear elasticity by using the unfolding method. It is
based on several decompositions of the structure displacements and on the
passing to the limit in fixed domains. We show that any displacement of a
structure is the sum of an elementary rods-structure displacement (e.r.s.d.)
concerning the rods cross sections and a residual one related to the
deformation of the cross-section. The e.r.s.d. coincide with rigid body
displacements in the junctions. Any e.r.s.d. is given by two functions
belonging to H1 (S;R3) where S is the skeleton structure (i.e. the set of the
rods middle lines). One of this function U is the skeleton displacement, the
other R gives the cross-sections rotation. We show that U is the sum of an
extensional displacement and an inextensional one. We establish a priori
estimates and then we characterize the unfolded limits of the rods-structure
displacements. Eventually we pass to the limit in the linearized elasticity
system and using all results in [5], on the one hand we obtain a variational
problem that is satisfied by the limit extensional displacement, and on the

static photoionization model and simulated with codes like CLOUDY (Ferland et

flux stops within a very short period. The star then re-appears from itsopaque

network motif aggregation reflects a local modularity property which is

of GOODS observed by Herschel in the framework of the GOODS-Herschel key
program and the local IRAS or AKARI-selected galaxies in the field of SDSS DR7,
we investigate the dependence of galaxy properties on the morphology of and the
distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy. We find that the SFRs and the SSFRs of
galaxies, on average, depend on the morphology of and the distance to the
nearest neighbor galaxy in this redshift range. When a late-type galaxy has a
close neighbor galaxy, the SFR and the SSFR increase as it approaches a
late-type neighbor, which is supported by K-S and MC tests with a significance
level of >99%. However, the SFR and the SSFR decrease or do not change much as
it approaches an early-type neighbor. The bifurcations of SFRs and SSFRs
depending on the neighbor's morphology seem to occur at R_n~0.5r_vir,nei, which
is supported by K-S and MC tests with a significance level of >98%. For all
redshift bins, the SSFRs of late-type galaxies interacting with late-type
neighbors are increased by factors of about 1.8+/-0.7 and 4.0+/-1.2 compared to
those of non-interacting galaxies when the pair separation is smaller than
0.5r_vir,nei and 0.1r_vir,nei, respectively. The Tdust of both local and high-z
late-type galaxies strongly interacting with late-type neighbors (i.e. R_n <
0.1r_vir,nei) appears to be higher than that of non-interacting galaxies with a
significance level of 96-99%. However, Tdust of local late-type galaxies
strongly interacting with early-type neighbors seems to be lower than or
similar to that of non-interacting galaxies. Our results suggest that
galaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers have been strongly affecting the SFR and
the dust properties of star-forming galaxies over at least 8 billion years.

model the chemical evolution of globular clusters. This model, is predicated
upon the assumption that clusters form within an interstellar medium enriched
locally by the ejecta of a single Type Ia supernova and varying numbers of
asymptotic giant branch stars, superimposed on an ambient medium pre-enriched
by low-metallicity Type II supernovae. Paper I was concerned with the
application of this model to the observed abundances of several reactive
elements and so-called non-metals for three classical intermediate-metallicity
clusters, with the hallmark of the work being the successful recovery of many
of their well-known elemental and isotopic abundance anomalies. Here, we expand
upon our initial analysis by (a) applying the model to a much broader range of
metallicities (from the factor of three explored in Paper I, to now, a factor
of ~50; i.e., essentially, the full range of Galactic globular cluster
abundances, and (b) incorporating a broader suite of chemical species,
including a number of iron-peak isotopes, heavier alpha-elements, and fluorine.
While most empirical globular cluster abundance trends are reproduced, our
model would suggest the need for a higher production of Ca, Si, and Cu in
low-metallicity (or so-called ""prompt"") Type Ia supernovae than predicted in
current stellar models in order to reproduce the observed trends in NGC 6752,
and a factor of two reduction in carbon production from asymptotic giant branch
stars to explain the observed trends between carbon and nitrogen. Observations
of heavy-element isotopes produced primarily by Type Ia supernovae, including
those of titanium, iron, and nickel, could support/refute unequivocally our
proposed framework. Hydrodynamical simulations would be necessary to study its
viability from a dynamical point of view.

same effective temperature and luminosity class clearly indicates that they are
systematically smaller than those of the standard stars. The primary components
of the classical Algols, located in the main-sequence band of the HR diagram,
appear to be C poor stars. We estimate $ [N_{C} /N_{tot}] $ relative to the Sun
as -1.91 for GT Cep, -1.88 for AU Mon and -1.41 for TU Mon, indicating poorer C
abundance. An average differential carbon abundance has been estimated to be
-0.82 dex relative to the Sun and -0.54 dex relative to the main-sequence
standard stars. This result is taken to be an indication of the transferring
material from the evolved less-massive secondary components to the gainers such
that the CNO cycle processed material changed the original abundance of the
gainers. There appear to be relationships between the EWs of C II $\lambda$
4267 \AA line and the rates orbital period increase and mass transfer in some
Algols. As the mass transfer rate increases the EW of the C II line decreases,
which indicates that accreted material has not been completely mixed yet in the
surface layers of the gainers. This result supports the idea of mixing as an
efficient process to remove the abundance anomaly built up by accretion.
Chemical evolution of the classical Algol-type systems may lead to constrains
on the initial masses of the less massive, evolved, mass-losing stars.

(PBCs), within Density Functional Theory (DFT), with particular emphasis on
linear-scaling (LS) DFT. Often, PBCs are not physically realistic but are an
unavoidable consequence of the choice of basis set and the efficacy of using
Fourier transforms to compute the Hartree potential. In such cases the effects
of PBCs on the calculations need to be avoided, so that the results obtained
represent the open rather than the periodic boundary. The very large systems
encountered in LS-DFT make the demands of the supercell approximation for
isolated systems more difficult to manage, and we show cases where the open
boundary (infinite cell) result cannot be obtained from extrapolation of
calculations from periodic cells of increasing size. We discuss, implement and
test three very different approaches for overcoming or circumventing the
effects of PBCs: truncation of the Coulomb interaction combined with padding of
the simulation cell, approaches based on the minimum image convention, and the
explicit use of Open Boundary Conditions (OBCs). We have implemented these
approaches in the ONETEP LS-DFT program and applied them to a range of systems,
including a polar nanorod and a protein. We compare their accuracy, complexity,
and rate of convergence with simulation cell size. We demonstrate that
corrective approaches within PBCs can achieve the OBC result more efficiently
and accurately than pure OBC approaches.

exotic $\mathbb{R}_{k}^{4}$, $k=2p$, $p=1,2...$. This is achieved by
superstring theory using gravitational backreaction induced from a strong,
almost constant magnetic field on standard $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. The exact string

curved geometry of $SU(2)_{k}\times\mathbb{R}$ as part of the modified exact

calculations of the spectra are using the CFT marginal deformations and
Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models. The marginal deformations capture the effects
of the magnetic field as well as its gravitational backreactions. The spectra
depend on even level $k$ of WZW on SU(2). At the same time the WZ term as

obtained in the case of the injection of electrons in the inner part of the jet

Distortions (RSDs) and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) are both
sensitive to the time derivative of the linear growth function. We investigate
the extent to which these probes provide complementary or redundant information
when they are combined to constrain the evolution of the linear velocity power
spectrum, often quantified by the function $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, where $f$ is the
logarithmic derivative of $\sigma_8$ with respect to $(1+z)$. Using a spherical
Fourier-Bessel (SFB) expansion for galaxy number counts and a spherical
harmonic expansion for the CMB anisotropy, we compute the covariance matrices
of the signals for a large galaxy redshift survey combined with a CMB survey
like Planck. The SFB basis allows accurate ISW estimates by avoiding the
plane-parallel approximation, and it retains RSD information that is otherwise
lost when projecting angular clustering onto redshift shells. It also allows
straightforward calculations of covariance with the CMB. We find that the
correlation between the ISW and RSD signals are low since the probes are
sensitive to different modes. For our default surveys, on large scales ($k<0.05
\Mpc/h$), the ISW can improve constraints on $f\sigma_8$ by more than 10%
compared to using RSDs alone. In the future, when precision RSD measurements
are available on smaller scales, the cosmological constraints from ISW
measurements will not be competitive; however, they will remain a useful
consistency test for possible systematic contamination and alternative models
of gravity.

rapidly increase and then exponentially decay. The lifetime of the decay is

flat or inverted around the peak flux density. After that, the spectrum
gradually becomes steeper. The observed characteristics are consistent with

during the freezing of soils and other dense, particulate suspensions.
Motivated by experimental evidence, we consider the growth of an ice-filled
crack in a freezing soil. At low temperatures, ice in the crack exerts large
pressures on the crack walls that will eventually cause the crack to split
open. We show that the crack will then propagate across the soil to form a new
lens. The process is controlled by two factors: the cohesion of the soil, and
the geometrical supercooling of the water in the soil; a new concept introduced
to measure the energy available to form a new ice lens. When the supercooling
exceeds a critical amount (proportional to the cohesive strength of the soil) a
new ice lens forms. This condition for ice-lens formation and growth does not
appeal to any ad hoc, empirical assumptions, and explains how periodic ice
lenses can form with or without the presence of a frozen fringe. The proposed
mechanism is in good agreement with experiments, in particular explaining
ice-lens pattern formation, and surges in heave rate associated with the growth
of new lenses. Importantly for systems with no frozen fringe, ice-lens
formation and frost heave can be predicted given only the unfrozen properties
of the soil. We use our theory to estimate ice-lens growth temperatures
obtaining quantitative agreement with the limited experimental data that is
currently available. Finally we suggest experiments that might be performed in
order to verify this theory in more detail. The theory is generalizable to
complex natural-soil scenarios, and should therefore be useful in the
prediction of macroscopic frost heave rates.

formation. Recent proper motion observations provide convincing evidence of a
recent (about 500 years ago) dynamical interaction between two massive young
stellar objects in the region resulting in high velocities: the BN object and
radio Source I. At the same time, Source I is surrounded by a nearly edge-on
disc with radius ~50 au. These two observations taken together are puzzling: a
dynamical encounter between multiple stars naturally yields the proper motions,
but the survival of a disc is challenging to explain. In this paper we take the
first steps to numerically explore the preferred dynamical scenario of Goddi et
al., in which Source I is a binary that underwent a scattering encounter with
BN, in order to determine if a pre-existing disc can survive this encounter in
some form. Treating only gravitational forces, we are able to thoroughly and
efficiently cover a large range of encounter parameters. We find that disc
material can indeed survive a three-body scattering event if 1) the encounter
is close, i.e. BN's closest approach to Source I is comparable to Source I's
semi-major axis; and 2) the interplay of the three stars is of a short
duration. Furthermore, we are able to constrain the initial conditions that can
broadly produce the orientation of the present-day system's disc relative to
its velocity vector. To first order we can thus confirm the plausibility of the
scattering scenario of Goddi et al., and we have significantly constrained the
parameters and narrowed the focus of future, more complex and expensive
attempts to computationally model the complicated BN/KL region.

temperature superconductivity but, under special circumstances, they can also
order into filaments called stripes. Whether an underlying tendency of charges
to order is present in all cuprates and whether this has any relationship with
superconductivity are, however, two highly controversial issues. In order to
uncover underlying electronic orders, magnetic fields strong enough to
destabilise superconductivity can be used. Such experiments, including quantum
oscillations in YBa2Cu3Oy (a notoriously clean cuprate where charge order is
not observed) have suggested that superconductivity competes with spin, rather
than charge, order. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that
high magnetic fields actually induce charge order, without spin order, in the
CuO2 planes of YBa2Cu3Oy. The observed static, unidirectional, modulation of
the charge density breaks translational symmetry, thus explaining quantum
oscillation results, and we argue that it is most likely the same 4a-periodic
modulation as in stripe-ordered cuprates. The discovery that it develops only
when superconductivity fades away and near the same 1/8th hole doping as in
La2-xBaxCuO4 suggests that charge order, although visibly pinned by CuO chains
in YBa2Cu3Oy, is an intrinsic propensity of the superconducting planes of high

that both torsion and curvature must vanish. The resolution of the confusion is

Period-Luminosity (PL) relation as delineated by the sample of Cepheids in the

quite different from the massive spiral galaxies used for calibrating the
extragalactic distance scale. Recent investigations suggest that not only the
zero-point but also the slope of the Milky Way PL relation differ significantly
from that of the LMC, casting doubts on the universality of the Cepheid PL
relation. We want to make a differential comparison of the PL relations in the
two galaxies by delineating the PL relations using the same method, the
infrared surface brightness method (IRSB), and the same precepts. The IRSB
method is a Baade-Wesselink type method to determine individual distances to
Cepheids. We apply a newly revised calibration of the method as described in an
accompanying paper (Paper I) to 36 LMC and five SMC Cepheids and delineate new
PL relations in the V,I,J, & K bands as well as in the Wesenheit indices in the
optical and near-IR. We present 509 new and accurate radial velocity
measurements for a sample of 22 LMC Cepheids, enlarging our earlier sample of
14 stars to include 36 LMC Cepheids. The new calibration of the IRSB method is
directly tied to the recent HST parallax measurements to ten Milky Way
Cepheids, and we find a LMC barycenter distance modulus of 18.45+-0.04 (random
error only) from the 36 individual LMC Cepheid distances. We find a significant
metallicity effect on the Wvi index gamma(Wvi)=-0.23+-0.10 mag/dex as well as
an effect on the slope. The K-band PL relation on the other hand is found to be
an excellent extragalactic standard candle being metallicity insensitive in
both slope and zero-point and at the same time being reddening insensitive and
showing the least internal dispersion.

have recalibrated the projection factor using the recent parallax measurements

should be independent of pulsation period. We confirm our earlier finding that
the projection factor for converting radial velocity to pulsational velocity
depends quite steeply on pulsation period, p=1.550-0.186*log(P) in disagrement

111 Cepheids with direct distances from the IRSB analysis. The relations are by

for researchers. We studied the kinetics of natural 'room temperature' ageing
(NA) in Al-Mg-Si alloys by means of various different techniques, namely
electrical resistivity and hardness measurement, thermoanalysis and positron
lifetime and Doppler broadening (DB) spectroscopy to identify the stages in
which the negative effect of NA on artificial ageing might appear. Positron
lifetime measurements were carried out in a fast mode, allowing us to measure
average lifetimes in below 1 minute. DB measurements were carried out with a
single detector and a 68Ge positron source by employing high momentum analysis.
The various measurements show that NA is much more complex than anticipated and
at least four different stages can be distinguished. The nature of these stages
cannot be given with certainty, but a possible sequence includes vacancy
diffusion to individual solute atoms, nucleation of solute clusters, Mg
agglomeration to clusters and coarsening or ordering of such clusters. Positron
lifetime measurements after more complex ageing treatments involving storage at
0{\deg}C, 20{\deg}C and 180{\deg}C have also been carried out and help to
understand the mechanisms involved.

true mean mu (physically non-negative) in an experiment with a Gaussian
resolution function with known fixed rms deviation s. The most powerful
one-sided upper confidence limit at 95% C.L. is UL = x+1.64s, which I refer to
as the ""original diagonal line"". Perceived problems in HEP with small or
non-physical upper limits for x<0 historically led, for example, to
substitution of max(0,x) for x, and eventually to abandonment in the Particle
Data Group's Review of Particle Physics of this diagonal line relationship
between UL and x. Recently Cowan, Cranmer, Gross, and Vitells (CCGV) have
advocated a concept of ""power constraint"" that when applied to this problem
yields variants of diagonal line, including UL = max(-1,x)+1.64s. Thus it is
timely to consider again what is problematic about the original diagonal line,
and whether or not modifications cure these defects. In a 2002 Comment,
statistician Leon Jay Gleser pointed to the literature on recognizable and
relevant subsets. For upper limits given by the original diagonal line, the
sample space for x has recognizable relevant subsets in which the quoted 95%
C.L. is known to be negatively biased (anti-conservative) by a finite amount
for all values of mu. This issue is at the heart of a dispute between Jerzy
Neyman and Sir Ronald Fisher over fifty years ago, the crux of which is the
relevance of pre-data coverage probabilities when making post-data inferences.
The literature describes illuminating connections to Bayesian statistics as
well. Methods such as that advocated by CCGV have 100% unconditional coverage
for certain values of mu and hence formally evade the traditional criteria for
negatively biased relevant subsets; I argue that concerns remain. Comparison
with frequentist intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins also sheds light on
the issues.

A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the description of the MORPHOT
tool, whose application is limited, at least for the moment, to the WINGS
imaging only. The approach of the tool to the automation of morphological
classification is a non parametric and fully empiri- cal one. In particular,
MORPHOT exploits 21 morphological diagnostics, directly and easily computable
from the galaxy image, to provide two independent classifications: one based on
a Maximum Likelihood (ML), semi-analytical technique, the other one on a Neural
Network (NN) machine. A suitably selected sample of ~1000 visually clas- sified
WINGS galaxies is used to calibrate the diagnostics for the ML estimator and as
a training set in the NN machine. The final morphological estimator combines
the two techniques and proves to be effective both when applied to an

compared with small samples of SDSS galaxies visually classified by Fukugita et
al. (2007) and Nair et al. (2010). Finally, besides the galaxy morphology

about protostellar objects in a search for correlations involving the
interstellar magnetic field. Specifically, we carried out an optical
polarimetric study of a sample of 28 fields of 10 X 10 arcmin^2 located in the
neighborhood of protostellar jets and randomly spread over the Galaxy. The
polarimetry of a large number of field stars is used to estimate both the
average and dispersion of the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) direction in
each region. The results of the applied statistical tests are as follows.
Concerning the alignment between the jet direction and the interstellar
magnetic field, the whole sample does not show alignment. There is, however, a
statistically significant alignment for objects of Classes 0 and I. Regarding
the interstellar magnetic field dispersion, our sample presents values slightly
larger for regions containing T Tauri objects than for those harboring younger
protostars. Moreover the ISMF dispersion in regions containing high-mass
objects tends to be larger than in those including only low-mass protostars. In
our sample, the mean interstellar polarization as a function of the average
interstellar extinction in a region reaches a maximum value around 3% for A(V)
= 5, after which it decreases. Our data also show a clear correlation of the
mean value of the interstellar polarization with the dispersion of the
interstellar magnetic field: the larger the dispersion, the smaller the
polarization. Based on a comparison of our and previous results, we suggest
that the dispersion in regions forming stars is larger than in quiescent
regions.

scale flow behaves as a two dimensional (non-MHD) fluid exhibiting an inverse
cascade of energy in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, while
the small scales behave like a three dimensional MHD-fluid cascading the energy
forwards. The amplitude of the inverse cascade is sensitive to the magnetic

All these dependencies are demonstrated by the varying parameters of

these tasks can require integrating multiple sources of remote information ?
typically, a slow, I/O-bound process ? it is desirable to make execution as
efficient as possible. To address both of these needs, we present a flexible
software agent plan language and a highly parallel execution system that enable
the efficient execution of expressive agent plans. The plan language allows
complex tasks to be more easily expressed by providing a variety of operators
for flexibly processing the data as well as supporting subplans (for
modularity) and recursion (for indeterminate looping). The executor is based on
a streaming dataflow model of execution to maximize the amount of operator and
data parallelism possible at runtime. We have implemented both the language and
executor in a system called THESEUS. Our results from testing THESEUS show that
streaming dataflow execution can yield significant speedups over both
traditional serial (von Neumann) as well as non-streaming dataflow-style
execution that existing software and robot agent execution systems currently
support. In addition, we show how plans written in the language we present can
represent certain types of subtasks that cannot be accomplished using the
languages supported by network query engines. Finally, we demonstrate that the
increased expressivity of our plan language does not hamper performance;
specifically, we show how data can be integrated from multiple remote sources

still many unanswered questions in the field of galaxy formation and evolution.
One of the longest standing issue being the significance of the formation place
and thus initial conditions to a galaxy's evolution in respect to environment,
often formulated simply as ""nature versus nurture"" like in human development
and psychology. Unfortunately, our understanding of galaxy evolution in
different environments is still limited, albeit, for example, the
morphology-density relation has shown that the density of the galaxy's local
environment can affect its properties. Consequently, the environment should
play a role in galaxy evolution, however despite the efforts, the exact role of
the galaxy's local environment to its evolution remains open. This thesis
introduction discusses briefly the background cosmology, cosmological N-body
simulations and semi-analytical models. The second part is reserved for groups
of galaxies, whether they are gravitationally bound, and what this may imply
for galaxy evolution. The third part of the thesis concentrates on describing
results of a case study of isolated field elliptical galaxies. The final
chapter discusses another case study of luminous infra-red galaxies.
