high energy. The decay length of a $B$ meson of energy above $10^7$ GeV is
larger than 1 km, implying that such a particle tends to interact in the air
before it decays. We show that the fraction of energy deposited in these
interactions is much smaller than in proton and pion collisions. We
parameterize their elasticity and determine the average number of interactions
and the atmospheric depth at the decay point for different initial energies. We
find that the profile of a $3\times 10^9$ GeV bottom shower may be very
different from the profile of a proton shower of the same energy, defining
either a very deep maximum, or two maxima, or other features that cannot be
parameterized with a single Gaisser-Hillas function. Finally, we discuss under
what conditions a bottom hadron inside the parent air shower may provide
observable effects.

evolution separated from the other subsystem, R. One may ask under which
conditions this evolution destroys all initial correlations between the
subsystems A and R, i.e. decouples the subsystems. A quantitative answer to
this question is provided by decoupling theorems, which have been developed
recently in the area of quantum information theory. This paper builds on
preceding work, which shows that decoupling is achieved if the evolution on A
consists of a typical unitary, chosen with respect to the Haar measure,
followed by a process that adds sufficient decoherence. Here, we prove a
generalized decoupling theorem for the case where the unitary is chosen from an
approximate two-design. A main implication of this result is that decoupling is
physical, in the sense that it occurs already for short sequences of random
two-body interactions, which can be modeled as efficient circuits. Our
decoupling result is independent of the dimension of the R system, which shows
that approximate 2-designs are appropriate for decoupling even if the dimension
of this system is large.

k=ceil{M/(N-M)}. While the DoF outer bound is established for every M_T, M_R
value, the achievability is established in general subject to normalization
with respect to spatial-extensions. Given spatial-extensions, the achievability
relies only on linear beamforming based interference alignment schemes with no
need for time/frequency extensions. In the absence of spatial extensions, we
show through examples how essentially the same scheme may be applied over
time/frequency extensions. The central new insight to emerge from this work is
the notion of subspace alignment chains as DoF bottlenecks.
  The DoF value d(M,N) is a piecewise linear function of M,N, with either M or
N being the bottleneck within each linear segment. The corner points of these
piecewise linear segments correspond to A={1/2,2/3,3/4,...} and
B={1/3,3/5,5/7,...}. The set A contains all values of M/N and only those for
which there is redundancy in both M and N. The set B contains all values of M/N
and only those for which there is no redundancy in either M or N.
  Our results settle the feasibility of linear interference alignment,
introduced by Cenk et al., for the 3 user M_T x M_R MIMO interference channel,
completely for all values of M_T, M_R. Specifically, the linear interference
alignment problem (M_T x M_R, d)^3 (as defined in previous work by Cenk et al.)
is feasible if and only if d<=floor{d(M,N)}. With and only with the exception
of the values M/N\in B, we show that for every M/N value there are proper
systems that are not feasible.
  Our results show that M/N\in A are the only values for which there is no DoF
benefit of joint processing among co-located antennas at the transmitters or
receivers.

adequately represent 'innocent' strategies, in the sense of game semantics. We
equip innocent strategies with a simple notion of interaction. We then prove
decomposition results for innocent strategies, and, restricting to presheaves
of finite ordinals, prove that innocent strategies are a final coalgebra for a
polynomial functor derived from the game. This leads to a translation of CCS
with recursive equations. Finally, we propose a notion of 'interactive
equivalence' for innocent strategies, which is close in spirit to Beffara's
interpretation of testing equivalences in concurrency theory. In this
framework, we consider analogues of fair testing and must testing. We show that
must testing is strictly finer in our model than in CCS, since it avoids what
we call 'spatial unfairness'. Still, it differs from fair testing, and we show
that it coincides with a relaxed form of fair testing.

an open question related to elections: the choice of elections candidates

motivations, this system displays features of traditional out-of-equilibrium
physical phenomena such as scale-free statistics and universality. Basically,
we found a non-linear (power law) mean correspondence between the number of

this choice has a multiplicative underlying process (lognormal behavior). The
universality of our findings is supported by data from 16 elections from 5

connected to this universal behavior.

efficient in practice for the distributed computation of aggregate functions in
communication networks where individual processors do not have access to global
information. Previous distributed aggregation protocols, based on repeated
sharing of input values (or mass) among processors, sometimes called
Mass-Distribution (MD) protocols, are not resilient to communication failures
(or message loss) because such failures yield a loss of mass. In this paper, we
present a protocol which we call Mass-Distribution with Flow-Updating (MDFU).
We obtain MDFU by applying FU techniques to classic MD. We analyze the
convergence time of MDFU showing that stochastic message loss produces low
overhead. This is the first convergence proof of an FU-based algorithm. We
evaluate MDFU experimentally, comparing it with previous MD and FU protocols,
and verifying the behavior predicted by the analysis. Finally, given that MDFU
incurs a fixed deviation proportional to the message-loss rate, we adjust the
accuracy of MDFU heuristically in a new protocol called MDFU with Linear
Prediction (MDFU-LP). The evaluation shows that both MDFU and MDFU-LP behave
very well in practice, even under high rates of message loss and even changing

its crucial role in the chemical enrichment of galaxies. Thanks to the recent
detection of solar-like oscillations in G-K giants in open clusters with
Kepler, we can now directly determine stellar masses for a statistically
significant sample of stars in the old open clusters NGC6791 and NGC6819. The
aim of this work is to constrain the integrated RGB mass loss by comparing the
average mass of stars in the red clump (RC) with that of stars in the
low-luminosity portion of the RGB (i.e. stars with L <~ L(RC)). Stellar masses
were determined by combining the available seismic parameters numax and Dnu
with additional photometric constraints and with independent distance
estimates. We measured the masses of 40 stars on the RGB and 19 in the RC of
the old metal-rich cluster NGC6791. We find that the difference between the
average mass of RGB and RC stars is small, but significant (Delta M=0.09 +-
0.03 (random) +- 0.04 (systematic) Msun). Interestingly, such a small DeltaM
does not support scenarios of an extreme mass loss for this metal-rich cluster.
If we describe the mass-loss rate with Reimers' prescription, a first
comparison with isochrones suggests that the observed DeltaM is compatible with
a mass-loss efficiency parameter in the range 0.1 <~ eta <~ 0.3. Less stringent
constraints on the RGB mass-loss rate are set by the analysis of the ~ 2
Gyr-old NGC6819, largely due to the lower mass loss expected for this cluster,
and to the lack of an independent and accurate distance determination. In the
near future, additional constraints from frequencies of individual pulsation
modes and spectroscopic effective temperatures, will allow further stringent
tests of the Dnu and numax scaling relations, which provide a novel, and
potentially very accurate, means of determining stellar radii and masses.

cloud cores are presented. We derive a generalised criterion from MHD wind
theory to analyse the launching mechanism of these outflows. The criterion is
successfully applied to the whole outflow structure and cases with
sub-Keplerian disc rotation. It allows us to decide whether an outflow is
driven centrifugally or by the toroidal magnetic pressure. We show that
quantities such as the magnetic field line inclination or the ratio of the
toroidal to poloidal magnetic field alone are insufficient to determine the
driving mechanism of outflows. By performing 12 runs we are able to study the
influence of the initial conditions on the properties of outflows around
massive protostars in detail. Our simulations reveal a strong effect of the
magnetic field strength on the outflow morphology. In runs with weak fields or
high rotational energies, well collimated, fast jets are observed whereas for
strong fields poorly collimated, low-velocity outflows are found. We show that
the occurrence of a fast jet is coupled to the existence of a Keplerian
protostellar disc. Despite the very different morphologies all outflows are
launched from the discs by centrifugal acceleration with the toroidal magnetic
field increasingly contributing to the gas acceleration further away from the
discs. The poor collimation of the outflows in runs with strong fields is a
consequence of the weak hoop stresses. This in turn is caused by the slow
build-up of a toroidal field due to sub-Keplerian disc rotation. The mass
ejection/accretion ratios scatter around a mean of 0.3 in accordance with
observational and analytical results. We suggest an evolutionary scenario for
the earliest stage of massive star formation in which initially poorly
collimated outflows develop which progressively get better collimated due to
the generation of fast jets.

$p_t \geq 0.15$ GeV/$c$, $|\eta| \leq 1$ and $2\pi$ azimuth. Observed

closely-related away-side azimuth dipole, and an azimuth quadrupole
conventionally associated with elliptic flow. The same-side 2D peak and
away-side dipole are explained by semihard parton scattering and fragmentation
(minijets) in proton-proton and peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions. Those
structures follow N-N binary-collision scaling in Au-Au collisions until
mid-centrality where a transition to a qualitatively different centrality trend
occurs within a small centrality interval. Above the transition point the
number of same-side and away-side correlated pairs increases rapidly {relative
to} binary-collision scaling, the $\eta$ width of the same-side 2D peak also
increases rapidly ($\eta$ elongation) and the $\phi$ width actually decreases
significantly. Those centrality trends are more remarkable when contrasted with
expectations of jet quenching in a dense medium. Observed centrality trends are
compared to {\sc hijing} predictions and to the expected trends for semihard
parton scattering and fragmentation in a thermalized opaque medium. We are
unable to reconcile a semihard parton scattering and fragmentation origin for
the observed correlation structure and centrality trends with heavy ion
collision scenarios which invoke rapid parton thermalization. On the other
hand, if the collision system is effectively opaque to few-GeV partons the
observations reported here would be inconsistent with a minijet picture.

emit at longer wavelengths. Thus, we propose the name ultra-soft source (USS)

  We present a VLT/FLAMES survey looking for USS in the SMC, selected to be
bright in the far UV and with blue far UV-V colors. While we find some unusual
objects, and recover known planetary nebula and WR stars, we detect no objects
with strong He II lines, which should be a signature of USS. This null result
either puts an upper limit on the number of USS in the SMC, or shows that we do
not understand what the optical spectra of such objects will look like.
  We also discuss the unusual LMC [WN] planetary nebula LMC N66 as a possible
example of an USS. It has a luminosity consistent with that expected, and its
spectra show incompletely CNO-processed material - strong helium lines, some
hydrogen, enhanced nitrogen and depleted carbon. It also shows periodic
outbursts. USS may resemble N66 in quiescence. However, it lacks a FUV excess,

Cosmic Microwave Background photons with a field of ~3nT, roughly a factor of
nine below the equipartition value. The remaining, more diffuse X-ray emission
is harder (HR=-0.09 +/- 0.22). With only 22.8+/-5.6 counts, the spectral form
cannot be constrained. Assuming thermal emission with a temperature of 4 keV
yields an estimate for the luminosity of 1.8E44 erg/s, consistent with the
luminosity-temperature relation of lower-redshift clusters. However deeper
Chandra X-ray observations are required to delineate the spatial distribution,
and better constrain the spectrum of the diffuse emission to verify that we
have detected X-ray emission from a high-redshift cluster.

destroy condensation leading to a so-called Bose glass. This phase has been
very elusive to experiments due to the absence of any broken symmetry and of a
finite energy gap in the spectrum. Here we report the observation of a Bose
glass of field-induced magnetic quasiparticles in a doped quantum magnet

magnetic field is equivalent to that of a lattice gas of bosons in the
grand-canonical ensemble; Br-doping introduces disorder in the hoppings and
interaction strengths, leading to localization of the bosons into a Bose glass
down to zero field, where it acquires the nature of an incompressible Mott
glass. The transition from the Bose glass (corresponding to a gapless spin
liquid) to the BEC (corresponding to a magnetically ordered phase) is marked by
a novel, universal exponent governing the scaling on the critical temperature
with the applied field, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.

processes in the gas. Numerical simulations have played a key role in
characterizing the properties of astrophysical turbulence, but thus far
systematic code comparisons have been restricted to the supersonic regime,
leaving it unclear whether subsonic turbulence is faithfully represented by the
numerical techniques commonly employed in astrophysics. Here we focus on
comparing the accuracy of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and our new
moving-mesh technique AREPO in simulations of driven subsonic turbulence. To
make contact with previous results, we also analyze simulations of transsonic
and highly supersonic turbulence. We find that the widely employed standard
formulation of SPH yields problematic results in the subsonic regime. Instead
of building up a Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade, large-scale eddies are
quickly damped close to the driving scale and decay into small-scale velocity
noise. Reduced viscosity settings improve the situation, but the shape of the
dissipation range differs compared with expectations for a Kolmogorov cascade.
In contrast, our moving-mesh technique does yield power-law scaling laws for
the power spectra of velocity, vorticity and density, consistent with
expectations for fully developed isotropic turbulence. We show that large
errors in SPH's gradient estimate and the associated subsonic velocity noise
are ultimately responsible for producing inaccurate results in the subsonic

10 kpc) exhibit an anisotropic distribution that may be equated to a plane (24
+/- 4) kpc thick (rms) and inclined at 8 degrees +/- 5 degrees to the polar
axis of the Milky Way disk. To quantify the significance of this plane we
determine the fraction of times that an isotropic distribution replicates the
observed distribution in Monte-Carlo trials. The plane is found to remain
significant at the >95% level outside a galactocentric radius of 10 kpc, inside
this radius the spatial distribution is apparently isotropic. In contrast, the
spatial distribution of the old halo sample outside 10 kpc is well matched by
an isotropic distribution. The plane described by the outer young halo globular
clusters is indistinguishable in orientation from that presented by the
satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Simulations have shown that the planar
arrangement of satellites can arise as filaments of the surrounding large scale
structure feed into the Milky Way's potential. We therefore propose that our
results are direct observational evidence for the accreted origin of the outer

skew. In the past this skewness has been modelled by superposed Gaussians. We
use dynamical arguments to derive an analytic formula that can be fitted to
observed velocity distributions, and validate it by fits to the velocities
derived from a dynamically rigorous model, and to a sample of local stars with
accurate space velocities. Our formula is much easier to use than a full
distribution function. It has fewer parameters than a multi-Gaussian fit, and
the best-fitting model parameters give insight into the underlying disc
dynamics. In particular, once the azimuthal velocities of a sample have been
successfully fitted, the apparatus provides a prediction for the corresponding
distribution of radial velocities vR . An effective formula like ours is
invaluable when fitting to data for stars at some distance from the Sun because
it enables one to make proper allowance for the errors in distance and proper
motion when determining the underlying disc kinematics. The derivation of our
formula elucidates the way the horizontal and vertical motions are closely
intertwined, and makes it evident that no stellar population can have a scale
height and vertical velocity dispersions that are simultaneously independent of
radius. We show that the oscillation of a star perpendicular to the Galactic

have learned much about the nature of the haze, and with the release of data
from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the discovery of the gamma-ray
haze/bubbles, we have had a spectacular confirmation of its existence at other
wavelengths. As the WMAP mission winds down and the Planck mission prepares to
release data, I take a last look at what WMAP has to tell us about the origin
of this unique Galactic feature. Much like the gamma-rays, the microwave
haze/bubbles is elongated in latitude with respect to longitude by a factor of
roughly two, and at high latitudes, the microwave emission cuts off sharply
above ~35 degrees (compared to ~50 degrees in the gammas). The hard spectrum of
electrons required to generate the microwave synchrotron is consistent with
that required to generate the gamma-ray emission via inverse Compton
scattering, though it is likely that these signals result from distinct regions
of the spectrum (~10 GeV for the microwaves, ~1 TeV for the gammas). While
there is no evidence for significant haze polarization in the 7-year WMAP data,
I demonstrate explicitly that it is unlikely such a signal would be detectable
above the noise.

J0852.0-4622 (aka Vela Jr) by the Parkes Multibeam Survey. The position of the
pulsar is in spatial coincidence with an enhancement in X-rays and TeV
gamma-rays, which could represent its pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We have
revealed with an XMM-Newton observation the X-ray counterpart of the pulsar
together with a surrounding extended emission thus confirming the suggestion of
a PWN. The comparison of the absorption column density derived in X-rays from
the pulsar with 12CO observations (tracing the dense gas) is used to derive an
upper limit to the distance of the pulsar (d< 900 pc) and to discuss a possible
association of the pulsar with the Vela Jr SNR. This new distance estimate
implies that the pulsar is nearby and could therefore significantly contribute
to the observed spectrum of cosmic-ray leptons (e-/e+).

find that, when the orbits of the companions are coplanar and not too widely

realistic initial conditions, such as with slightly non-coplanar orbits and
unequal-mass companions. If the companions start widely separated then
collision are very rare except in some cases when the total mass of the

more appropriate, as well as being easier to understand and to calculate.
Unlike regression, the line fit we propose treats both variables in the same
way. Remarkably, it provides a slope that is precisely the ratio of the
volatility of the investment's rate of return to the volatility of the market
index rate of return (or the equivalent excess rates of returns). Hence, this
line fitting method gives an alternative beta, which corresponds exactly to the
relative volatility of an investment - which is one of the usual

celebrating nowadays entering its third decade of tackling numerically-exactly
a broad range of correlated multi-dimensional non-equilibrium quantum dynamical
systems. Taking in recent years particles' statistics explicitly into account,
within the MCTDH for fermions (MCTDHF) and for bosons (MCTDHB), has opened up
further opportunities to treat larger systems of interacting identical
particles, primarily in laser-atom and cold-atom physics. With the increase of
experimental capabilities to simultaneously trap mixtures of two, three, and
possibly even multiple kinds of interacting composite identical particles
together, we set up the stage in the present work and specify the MCTDH method
for such cases. Explicitly, the MCTDH method for systems with three kinds of
identical particles interacting via all combinations of two- and three-body
forces is presented, and the resulting equations-of-motion are briefly
discussed. All four possible mixtures of fermions and bosons are presented in a
unified manner. Particular attention is paid to represent the coefficients'
part of the equations-of-motion in a compact recursive form in terms of

cluster surveys. It is based on purely instrumental observable quantities,
considered in a two-dimensional X-ray colour-magnitude diagram (hardness ratio
versus count-rate). The basic principle is that, even in rather shallow
surveys, substantial information on cluster redshift and temperature is present
in the raw X-ray data and can be statistically extracted; in parallel, such
diagrams can be readily predicted from an ab initio cosmological modeling. We
illustrate the methodology for the case of a 100 deg2 XMM survey having a
sensitivity of ~10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 and fit at the same time, the survey
selection function, the cluster evolutionary scaling-relations and the
cosmology; our sole assumption -- driven by the limited size of the sample
considered in the case-study -- is that the local cluster scaling relations are
known. We devote special care to the realistic modeling of the count-rate
measurement uncertainties and evaluate the potential of the method via a Fisher
analysis. In the absence of individual cluster redshifts, the CR-HR method
appears to be much more efficient than the traditional approach based on
cluster counts (i.e. dn/dz, requiring redshifts). In the case where redshifts
are available, our method performs similarly as the traditional mass function
(dn/dM/dz) for the purely cosmological parameters, but better constrains
parameters defining the cluster scaling relations and their evolution. A
further practical advantage of the CR-HR method is its simplicity : this fully
top-down approach totally bypasses the tedious steps consisting in deriving
cluster masses from X-ray temperature measurements.

objects (347 clusters), we perform a cosmological analysis using the X-ray
information only. The analysis consists in the modelling of the observed
colour-magnitude (CR-HR) diagram constructed from cluster instrumental
count-rates measured in the [0.5-2], [1-2] and [0.5-1] keV bands. A MCMC
procedure simultaneously fits the cosmological parameters, the evolution of the
cluster scaling laws and the selection effects. Our results are consistent with
the sigma_8 and Omega_m values obtained by WMAP-5 and point toward a negative
evolution of the cluster scaling relations with respect to the self-similar
expectation. We are further able to constrain the cluster fractional radius
xc0=r_c/r500c, to xc0=0.24 +/- 0.04. This study stresses again the critical
role of selection effects in deriving cluster scaling relations, even in the
local universe. Finally, we show that CR-HR method applied to the eRosita
all-sky survey - provided that cluster photometric redshifts are available -
will enable the determination of the equation of state of the dark energy at
the level of the DETF stage IV predictions; simultaneously, the evolution of

even at low Prandtl numbers, i.e., the critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm_c
necessary for the dynamo to be efficient becomes smaller than the hydrodynamic
Reynolds number Re when Re -> infinity. Aims: We test the conjecture (Iskakov
et al. 2007) that Rm_c actually tends to a finite value when Re -> infinity,
and we study the behavior of the dynamo growth factor \gamma\ at very low and
high magnetic Prandtl numbers. Methods: We use local and nonlocal shell-models
of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with parameters covering a much wider
range of Reynolds numbers than direct numerical simulations, but of
astrophysical relevance. Results: We confirm that Rm_c tends to a finite value
when Re -> infinity. The limit for Rm -> infinity of the dynamo growth factor
\gamma\ in the kinematic regime behaves like Re^\beta, and, similarly, the
limit for Re -> infinity of \gamma\ behaves like Rm^{\beta'}, with
\beta=\beta'=0.4. Conclusion: Comparison with a phenomenology based on an
intermittent small-scale turbulent dynamo, together with the differences
between the growth rates in the different local and nonlocal models, indicate a
weak contribution of nonlocal terms to the dynamo effect.

because of the suggestion that its electronic structure, calculated within
density functional theory using either the local density or the generalized
gradient approximations, displays zero-gap behavior. In light of the potential
ease of doping magnetic ions in this structure, it has been suggested that the
introduction of spin, in conjunction with zero band gap, can result in unusual
magnetic ground states and unusual magnetotransport. It is known that most
electronic structure calculations do not properly obtain a band gap even for
the simple oxide PdO, and instead obtain a metal or a zero-gap semiconductor.
Here we present density functional calculations employing a screened hybrid
functional (HSE) which correctly obtain a band gap for the electronic structure
of PdO. When employed to calculate the electronic ground state of PbPdO$_2$, a
band gap is again obtained, which is consistent both with the experimental data
on this compound, as well as a consideration of valence states and of
metal-oxygen connectivity in the crystal structure. We also present comparisons
of the absolute positions (relative to the vacuum level) of the conduction band
minima and the valence band maxima in {\alpha}-PbO, PdO and PbPdO$_2$, which

networks, with node degrees at least 0.9395(n-1), the homogeneous (equal
frequencies) model has no non-zero stable fixed point solution over the full
space of phase angles in the range -Pi to Pi. This result together with
existing research proves a conjecture of Verwoerd and Mason (2007) that for the
complete network and homogeneous model the zero fixed point has a basin of

necessary conditions are also tested to see how close to sufficiency they might
be by applying them to a class of regular degree networks studied by Wiley,

polynomial of a matroid polytope can be computed in polynomial time when the
number of elements varies. A key to proving this is the fact that the number of
simplicial cones in any triangulation of a tangent cone is bounded polynomially
in the number of elements when the rank is fixed. The authors speculated
whether or not the Ehrhart polynomial could be computed in polynomial time in
terms of the number of bases, where the number of elements and rank are allowed
to vary. We show here that for the uniform matroid of rank $r$ on $n$ elements,
the number of simplicial cones in any triangulation of a tangent cone is $n-2
\choose r-1$. Therefore, if the rank is allowed to vary, the number of
simplicial cones grows exponentially in $n$. Thus, it is unlikely that a
Brion-Lawrence type of approach, such as Barvinok's Algorithm, can compute the
Ehrhart polynomial efficiently when the rank varies with the number of
elements. To prove this result, we provide a triangulation in which the maximal
simplicies are in bijection with the spanning thrackles of the complete

NGC 1851 is evidence for its formation in the central region of its defunct
host dwarf galaxy. We numerically investigate the long-term dynamical evolution
of a nucleated dwarf galaxy embedded in a massive dark matter halo under the
strong tidal field of the Galaxy. The dwarf galaxy is assumed to have a stellar
nucleus (or a nuclear star cluster) that could be the progenitor for NGC 1851.
We find that although the dark matter halo and the stellar envelope of the host
dwarf of NGC 1851 can be almost completely stripped during its orbital
evolution around the Galaxy, a minor fraction of stars in the dwarf can remain
trapped by the gravitational field of the nucleus. The stripped nucleus can be
observed as NGC 1851 with no/little dark matter whereas stars around the
nucleus can be observed as a diffuse stellar halo around NGC 1851. The
simulated stellar halo has a symmetric distribution with a power-law density
slope of ~ -2 and shows no tidal tails within ~200pc from NGC 1851. We show
that two GCs can merge with each other to form a new nuclear GC embedded in
field stars owing to the low stellar velocity dispersion of the host dwarf.
This result makes no assumption on the ages and/or chemical abundances of the
two merging GCs. Thus the observed stellar halo and characteristic multiple
stellar populations in NGC 1851 suggest that NGC 1851 could have formed
initially in the central region of an ancient dwarf galaxy.

227 (L227) molecular cloud. Four luminous, early-type (B0-B5) stars are located
within a spherical volume ~5' in diameter that appears to be clear of heavy
obscuration. Approximately centered in the cleared region is the B0 V star HD
166033, which is thought to be largely responsible for the cavity's excavation.
Over 80 H-alpha emission sources brighter than V~21 have been identified in the
region. More than half of these are concentrated in IC 1274 and are presumably
members of a faint T Tauri star population. Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging
Spectrometer (ACIS) imaging of a nearby suspected pulsar and time-variable
gamma-ray source (GeV J1809-2327) detected 21 X-ray sources in the cluster
vicinity, some of which are coincident with the early-type stars and H-alpha
emitters in IC 1274. Deep (V~22) optical BVRI photometry has been obtained for
the cluster region. A distance of 1.82 +/- 0.3 kpc and a mean extinction of Av
~1.21 +/- 0.2 mag follow from photometry of the early-type stars. Using
pre-main-sequence evolutionary models, we derive a median age for the H-alpha
emitters and X-ray sources of ~1 Myr; however, a significant dispersion is
present. Our interpretation of the structure of IC 1274 is that the early-type
stars formed recently and are in the process of dispersing the molecular gas on
the near surface of L227. The displaced material was driven against what
remains of the molecular cloud to the east, enabling the formation of the
substantial number of T Tauri stars found there. We identify a V~21.5 star very
near the position of X-ray source 5, the assumed gamma-ray source and young
pulsar candidate. The lack of distinctive characteristics for this source,
however, coupled with the density of faint stars in this region suggest that
this may be a random superposition.

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations has opened up a new way to test cosmological
models. It is known that detection of a single supermassive cluster at a very
high redshift can rule out many cosmological models all together. However,
since dealing with different observational biases makes it difficult to test
the likeliness of the data assuming a cosmological model, most of the cluster
data (except those with high mass-redshift) stays untouched in confronting
cosmological models with cluster observations. We propose here that one can use
the relative abundance of the clusters with different masses at different
redshifts to test the likeliness of the data in the context of cosmological
models. For this purpose we propose a simple parametric form for the efficiency
of observing clusters at different mass-redshift and we test if the standard
LCDM model can explain the observed abundance of the clusters using this
efficiency parameterization. We argue that one cannot expect an unusual and
highly parametric form of the efficiency function to fit the observed data
assuming a theoretical model. Using many realizations of Monte Carlo
simulations we show that the standard spatially flat LCDM model is barely
consistent with the SPT cluster data using a simple and plausible
two-dimensional efficiency function for detection of the clusters. More cluster
data are needed to make any strong conclusion.

composed of old stellar populations, with mean mass-weighted stellar age around
10 Gyr. While the stellar population of pseudo-bulges is, in general, younger
than that of classical bulges, the difference is not significant, which
indicates that it is hard to distinguish pseudo-bulges from classical bulges,
at least for these isolated galaxies, only based on their stellar populations.
Pseudo-bulges have star formation activities with relatively longer timescale
than classical bulges, indicating that secular evolution is more important in
this kind of systems. Our results also show that pseudo-bulges have a lower
stellar velocity dispersion than their classical counterparts, which suggests
that classical bulges are more dispersion-supported than pseudo-bulges.

chromosphere to the corona reveals important information on the mass and energy
balance of the solar atmosphere, providing an important observational
constraint to any models of the solar corona. Previous spectroscopic
observations of vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) lines have revealed a persistent
average wavelength shift of lines formed at temperatures up to 1 MK. At higher
temperatures, the behaviour is still essentially unknown. Here we analyse
combined SUMER/SoHO and EIS/Hinode observations of the quiet Sun around disk
centre to determine, for the first time, the average Doppler shift of several
spectral lines formed between 1 and 2 MK, where the largest part of the quiet
coronal emission is formed. The measurements are based on a novel technique
applied to EIS spectra to measure the difference in Doppler shift between lines
formed at different temperatures. Simultaneous wavelength-calibrated SUMER
spectra allow establishing the absolute value at the reference temperature of 1
MK. The average line shifts at 1 MK < T < 1.8 MK are modestly, but clearly
bluer than those observed at 1 MK. By accepting an average blue shift of about
(-1.8+/-0.6) km/s at 1 MK (as provided by SUMER measurements), this translates
into a maximum Doppler shift of (-4.4+/-2.2) km/s around 1.8 MK. The measured
value appears to decrease to about (-1.3+/-2.6) km/s at the Fe XV formation
temperature of 2.1 MK. The measured average Doppler shift between 0.01 and 2.1

roughly quantitatively consistent with what foreseen by 3-D coronal models

telescopes. In the near infrared region, from 0.8 to 2.5 um, bandpass and edge
filters are used to separate the different astronomical channels, such as the
J, H, and K bands. However, in the same wavelength range light emission
generated in the earth's atmosphere is superimposed on the stellar radiation.
Therefore, ground based astronomical instruments measure, in addition to the
stellar light, also unwanted contributions from the earth's atmosphere. The
characteristic lines of this OH emission are extremely narrow and distributed
over the complete NIR spectral range. The sensitivity of future telescopes,
like the European Extreme Large Telescope (E-ELT) which is currently being
designed by ESO, can be dramatically improved if the atmospheric emission lines
are effectively suppressed while the stellar radiation is efficiently
transferred to the detector systems. For this task, new types of optical
filters have to be developed. In this framework new design concepts and
algorithms must be used, combining the measurement needs with practical
restrictions. Certainly, the selected deposition process plays the key role in
the manufacturing process. Precise and highly stable deposition systems are
necessary to realise such filter systems with an appropriate homogeneity.
Moreover, the production control techniques must be adapted to match the high
level of precision required in the NIR range. Finally, the characterisation
set-ups for such filters systems have to be provided. The manufacturing of such
a filter system for a feasibility study of an E-ELT instrument is presented.
The design development, the deposition with adapted Ion Beam Sputtering
deposition plants, and the characterisation of such filters in the J-Band is

beyond the usual initial steep decay phase. It has been suggested that these
events correspond to ""naked"" bursts that occur in a very low density
environment. We reconsider this possibility in the context of various scenarios
for the origin of the afterglow. In the standard model where the afterglow
results from the forward shock as well as in the alternative model where the
afterglow comes from the reverse shock, we aim to obtain constraints on the
density of the environment, the microphysics parameters, or the Lorentz factor
of the ejecta, which are imposed by the absence of a detected afterglow. For
the two models we compute the afterglow evolution for different values of the
external density (uniform or wind medium) and various burst parameters. We then
compare our results to the Swift data of GRB 050421, which is the best example
of a long burst without afterglow. In the standard model we show that
consistency with the data imposes that the external density does not exceed
1E-5 cm-3 or that the microphysics parameters are very small with epsilon_e <~
1E-2 and epsilon_B <~ 1E-4. If the afterglow is caused by the reverse shock, we
find that its contribution can be strongly reduced if the central source has
mainly emitted fast-moving material (with less than 10 - 30 % of the kinetic
energy at Gamma<100 and was located in a dense environment. The two considered
scenarios therefore lead to opposite constraints on the circumburst medium. The
high-density environment, favored by the reverse shock model, better
corresponds to what is expected if the burst progenitor was a massive star.

examined. Drawing-induced elongation of the Mg particles led, after HT, to a
textured macrostructure consisting of elongated polycrystalline MgB2 fibers
separated by elongated pores. The superconducting Tc, Jc and Fp were correlated
with the macrostructure and grain size. Grain size increased with HT time at
both 600C and 700C. Jc and hence Fp decreased monotonically but not linearly
with grain size. Overall, it was observed that at 700C, the MgB2 reaction was
more or less complete after as little as 30 min; at 600C, full reaction
completion did not occur until 71 h. into the HT. Transport, Jct(B) was
measured in a perpendicular applied field, and the magnetic critical current
densities, Jcm\bot(B) and Jcm{\phi}(B), were measured in perpendicular and
parallel (axial) applied fields, respectively. Particularly noticeable was the
premature dropoff of Jcm\bot(B) at fields well below the irreversibility field
of Jct(B). This effect is attributed to the fibrous macrostructure and its
accompanying anisotropic connectivity. Magnetic measurements with the field
directed along the strand axis yielded a critical density, Jcm\bot(B), for
current flowing transversely to the strand axis that was less than and dropped
off more rapidly than Jct(B). In the conventional magnetic measurement, the
loop currents that support the magnetization are restricted by the lower of
Jct(B) and Jcm{\phi} (B). In the present case the latter, leading to the
premature dropoff of the measured Jcm(B) compared to Jct(B) with increasing
field. This result is supported by Kramer plots of the Jcm{\phi} (B) and Jct(B)
data which lead to an irreversibility field for transverse current that is very
much less than the usual transport-measured longitudinal one, Birr,t.

usual approach is to compute the node centralities once the network structure

modify the centrality scores of the nodes by acting on the structure of a given

controlling sets, which can assign any prescribed set of centrality values to
all the nodes of a graph, by cooperatively tuning the weights of their
out-going links. We show that many large networks from the real world have
surprisingly small controlling sets, containing even less than 5-10% of the

fractionation problem. The two messages of this paper are: (i) dynamic
programming (DP) is a useful framework for adaptive radiation therapy,
particularly adaptive fractionation, because it allows us to assess how close
to optimal different methods are, and (ii) heuristic methods proposed in this
paper are near-optimal, and therefore, can be used to evaluate the best
possible benefit of using an adaptive fraction size.
  The essence of adaptive fractionation is to increase the fraction size when
the tumor and organ-at-risk (OAR) are far apart (a ""favorable"" anatomy) and to
decrease the fraction size when they are close together. Given that a fixed
prescribed dose must be delivered to the tumor over the course of the
treatment, such an approach results in a lower cumulative dose to the OAR when
compared to that resulting from standard fractionation. We first establish a
benchmark by using the DP algorithm to solve the problem exactly. In this case,
we characterize the structure of an optimal policy, which provides guidance for
our choice of heuristics. We develop two intuitive, numerically near-optimal
heuristic policies, which could be used for more complex, high-dimensional
problems. Furthermore, one of the heuristics requires only a statistic of the
motion probability distribution, making it a reasonable method for use in a
realistic setting. Numerically, we find that the amount of decrease in dose to
the OAR can vary significantly (5 - 85%) depending on the amount of motion in
the anatomy, the number of fractions, and the range of fraction sizes allowed.
In general, the decrease in dose to the OAR is more pronounced when: (i) we
have a high probability of large tumor-OAR distances, (ii) we use many
fractions (as in a hyper-fractionated setting), and (iii) we allow large daily
fraction size deviations.

subsamples of variables exhibiting the most regular behaviour are in good
agreement with theoretical expectations based on Horizontal-Branch stellar
evolution models. However, a large fraction of variables show period changes
that contradict the evolutionary expectations. Among the 134 stars studied, the
period-change behaviour of only 54 variables is regular (constant or linearly
changing), slight irregularities are superimposed on the regular variations in
23 cases and the remaining 57 stars display irregular period variations. The
light curve of ~50 per cent of the RRab stars is not stable, i.e., these
variables exhibit Blazhko modulation. The large fraction of variables with
peculiar behaviour (showing light-curve modulation and/or irregular O-C
variation) indicate that, probably, variables with regular period changes
incompatible with their evolutionary stages also could display some kind of
instability of the pulsation light curve and/or period, but the available
observations have not disclosed it yet. The temporal appearence of the Blazhko
effect in some stars, and the 70-90 years long regular changes preceded or
followed by irregular, rapid changes of the pulsation period in some cases

hot ring can be produced by an underdense region surrounded by a massive wall,
a decrement in the CMB temperature in the line-of-sight is suppressed because
of blueshift of CMB photons that pass the wall. Therefore, undercompensated
models give better agreement with the observed data in comparison with
overcompensated or compensated models. We find that it is likely that $\sim$90

explicit rules for generating the pronunciations for unseen words.
Pronunciation by analogy (PbA) is a data-driven method of constructing
pronunciations for novel words from concatenated segments of known words and
their pronunciations. PbA performs relatively well with English and outperforms
several other proposed methods. However, the best published word accuracy of
65.5% (for the 20,000 word NETtalk corpus) suggests there is much room for
improvement in it.
  Previous PbA algorithms have used several different scoring strategies such
as the product of the frequencies of the component pronunciations of the
segments, or the number of different segmentations that yield the same
pronunciation, and different combinations of these methods, to evaluate the
candidate pronunciations. In this article, we instead propose to use a
probabilistically justified scoring rule. We show that this principled approach
alone yields better accuracy (66.21% for the NETtalk corpus) than any
previously published PbA algorithm. Furthermore, combined with certain ad hoc
modifications motivated by earlier algorithms, the performance climbs up to
66.6%, and further improvements are possible by combining this method with

unresolved source plus an extended source whose expansion velocity onto the sky
plane is lower than 700km/s. The expansion of the Brgamma line forming region,
as inferred at t=28d and t=35d is slightly larger, implying velocities in the
range 500-800km/s, still strikingly lower than the velocities of 1300-1600km/s
inferred from the Doppler width of the line. Moreover, a remarkable pattern was
observed in the Brgamma differential phases. A semi-quantitative model using a
bipolar flow with a contrast of 2 between the pole and equator velocities, an
inclination of i=15^{\circ} and a position angle P.A.=110^{\circ} provides a
good match to the AMBER observables (spectra, differential visibilities and
phases). At t=48d, a PIONIER dataset confirms the two component nature of the H
band emission, consisting of an unresolved stellar source and an extended

change dark energy equation of state and modified gravity figures of merit by a
factor of four. The inclusion of cross-correlations of cosmic shear and galaxy
position measurements helps reduce the loss of constraining power from the
lensing shear surveys. When forecasts for Planck CMB and Stage IV surveys are
combined, constraints on the dark energy equation of state and modified gravity
model are recovered, relative to those from shear data with no systematic
uncertainties, if fewer than 36 free parameters in total are used to describe
the galaxy bias and intrinsic alignment models as a function of scale and
redshift. To facilitate future investigations, we also provide a fitting
function for the matter power spectrum arising from the phenomenological
modified gravity model we consider.

Modified Gravity figure of merit. We find that intrinsic alignments weaken the
dependence of figure of merit on area and that, for a fixed observing time, a
fiducial Stage IV survey plateaus above roughly 10,000deg2 for DE and peaks at
about 5,000deg2 as the relative importance of IAs at low redshift penalises
wide, shallow surveys. While reducing photometric redshift scatter improves
constraining power, the dependence is shallow. The variation in constraining
power is stronger once IAs are included and is slightly more pronounced for MG
constraints than for DE. The inclusion of intrinsic alignments and galaxy
position information reduces the required prior on photometric redshift
accuracy by an order of magnitude for both the fiducial Stage III and IV
surveys, equivalent to a factor of 100 reduction in the number of spectroscopic
galaxies required to calibrate the photometric sample.

studied by using the expansions over the so-called ""squared solutions"" (squared
eigenfunctions). Such deformations are equivalent to perturbed models with
external (self-consistent) sources. In this regard, the KdV6 equation is viewed
as a special perturbation of KdV equation. Applying expansions over the
symplectic basis of squared eigenfunctions, the integrability properties of the
KdV hierarchy with generic self-consistent sources are analyzed. This allows
one to formulate a set of conditions on the perturbation terms that preserve
the integrability. The perturbation corrections to the scattering data and to
the corresponding action-angle variables are studied. The analysis shows that
although many nontrivial solutions of KdV equations with generic
self-consistent sources can be obtained by the Inverse Scattering Transform
(IST), there are solutions that, in principle, can not be obtained via IST.
Examples are considered showing the complete integrability of KdV6 with
perturbations that preserve the eigenvalues time-independent. In another type
of examples the soliton solutions of the perturbed equations are presented
where the perturbed eigenvalue depends explicitly on time. Such equations,
however in general, are not completely integrable.

pseudogap, underdoped cuprates have attracted great interest in the high Tc
community for many years. A central issue concerns the role of quantum and
thermal fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter. The
evolution of superfluid density ns with temperature and doping is a powerful
probe of this physics. Here, we report superfluid density measurements on
underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi-2212) films at much lower dopings than have been
achieved previously, and with excellent control on doping level - Tc ranges
from Tc,min ~ 6K to Tc,max ~ 80K in steps of about 5K. Most famous studies on
Bi-2212 like angle-resolved photoemission and scanning probe microscopy are
surface-sensitive while superfluid density measurements are bulk-sensitive. We
find that strong two-dimensional quantum fluctuations are evident in the
observed linear scaling of Tc with ns(0) when Tc is below about 45 K, which
contrasts with three-dimensional quantum fluctuations evident in the square
root scaling, Tc $\propto \sqrt$ns(0), seen in the much less anisotropic
cuprate, YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO). On the other hand, consistent with YBCO, ns(T) in
severely underdoped Bi-2212 loses its strong downward curvature near Tc,
becoming quasi-linear without any obvious critical behavior near Tc. We argue
that the quasi-linear T dependence arises from thermal phase fluctuations,
although the current theory needs modification in order to understand some
features.

planetary transit light curves. As observations, for example from Kepler,
CoRot, and Most, become more precise then a greater understanding of
limb-darkening is necessary. However, limb-darkening is typically modeled as
simple parameterizations fit to plane-parallel model stellar atmospheres that
ignores stellar atmospheric extension. In this work, I compute linear,
quadratic and four-parameter limb-darkening laws from grids of plane-parallel
and spherically-symmetric model stellar atmospheres in a temperature and
gravity range representing stars evolving on the Red Giant branch. The
limb-darkening relations for each geometry are compared and are found to fit
plane-parallel models much better than the spherically-symmetric models.
Assuming that limb-darkening from spherically-symmetry model atmospheres are
more physically representative of actual stellar limb-darkening than
plane-parallel models then these limb-darkening laws will not fit the limb of a

P(p,q,r)$ with unknotting number one. Following the classification by Kobayashi
and Scharlemann-Thompson for all parameters odd, we treat the remaining
families with $r$ even. We discover that there are only four possible
subfamilies which may satisfy $u(K) = 1$. These families are determined by the
sum $p+q$ and their signature, and we resolve the problem in two of these
cases. Ingredients in our proofs include Donaldson's diagonalisation theorem
(as applied by Greene), Nakanishi's unknotting bounds from the Alexander
module, and the correction terms introduced by Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o. Based on
our results and the fact that the 2-bridge knots with unknotting number one are
already classified, we conjecture that the only 3-strand pretzel knots
$P(p,q,r)$ with unknotting number one that are not 2-bridge knots are
$P(3,-3,2)$ and its reflection.

entropy and probability estimation, in addition to many other interesting ones.
We particularly illustrate this approach by consistently estimating the size of
the alphabet and the range of the probabilities. We start by proposing an
abstract methodology based on constructing a probability measure with the
desired asymptotic properties. We then demonstrate two concrete constructions
by casting the Good-Turing estimator as a pseudo-empirical measure, and by
using the theory of mixture model estimation.

reducing complexity and storage requirements, when it comes to online
estimation of stationary signals as well as for tracking slowly-varying
nonstationary processes. In this paper, a distributed recursive least-squares
(D-RLS) algorithm is developed for cooperative estimation using ad hoc wireless
sensor networks. Distributed iterations are obtained by minimizing a separable
reformulation of the exponentially-weighted least-squares cost, using the
alternating-minimization algorithm. Sensors carry out reduced-complexity tasks
locally, and exchange messages with one-hop neighbors to consent on the
network-wide estimates adaptively. A steady-state mean-square error (MSE)
performance analysis of D-RLS is conducted, by studying a stochastically-driven
`averaged' system that approximates the D-RLS dynamics asymptotically in time.
For sensor observations that are linearly related to the time-invariant
parameter vector sought, the simplifying independence setting assumptions
facilitate deriving accurate closed-form expressions for the MSE steady-state
values. The problems of mean- and MSE-sense stability of D-RLS are also
investigated, and easily-checkable sufficient conditions are derived under
which a steady-state is attained. Without resorting to diminishing step-sizes
which compromise the tracking ability of D-RLS, stability ensures that per
sensor estimates hover inside a ball of finite radius centered at the true
parameter vector, with high-probability, even when inter-sensor communication
links are noisy. Interestingly, computer simulations demonstrate that the
theoretical findings are accurate also in the pragmatic settings whereby
sensors acquire temporally-correlated data.

corresponding quantization principle concerning the quantities of quantum
gravity. According to this presupposition there have to be given generalized
representations of the operators referring to the observables in the canonical
approach of a quantum description of general relativity. This also leads to
generalized constraints for the states and thus to a generalized Wheeler DeWitt
equation determining a new dynamical behaviour. As a special manifestation of
this modified canonical theory of quantum gravity there is explored quantum
cosmology. The generalized cosmological Wheeler DeWitt equation corresponding
to the application of the generalized quantization principle to the

method.

Zitterbewegung. Electromagnetic fields generated by these motions are studied,
and it is found that the retarded times are multi-sheeted functions of the
field points. This leads to non-uniqueness for the generated fields. It is
found that with fixed weighting factors for these multiple roots, the solutions
radiate electromagnetic energy. If the weighting factors are allowed to be
position dependent, however, then it is possible to suppress radiation by
solving a differential equation for these factors which ensures that the
solution is a non-radiating electromagnetic source. Motion in response to
external forces are also considered. Radiation suppression is possible here too
in some cases. These results are relevant for the idea that Kerr-Newman
solutions provide insight into elementary particles and into emergent quantum
mechanics.
