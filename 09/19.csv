biological world. It is the information center behind all vertebrate and most
invertebrate life, and thus has become a major focus in current research. While
many of these studies have concentrated on studying the brain directly, our
focus is the structure of the brain itself: at its core an interconnected
network of nodes (neurons). A better understanding of the structural aspects of
the brain should elucidate some of its functional properties. In this paper we
analyze the brain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Consisting of only
302 neurons, it is one of the better-understood neural networks. Using a
Laplacian matrix of the 279-neuron ""giant component"" of the network, we use an
eigenvalue counting function to look for fractal-like self similarity. This
matrix representation is also used to plot (in eigenfunction coordinates) both
2 and 3 dimensional visualizations of the neural network. Further analysis
examines the small-world properties of the system, including average path
length and clustering coefficient. We then test for localization of
eigenfunctions, using graph energy and spacial variance. To better understand
these results, all of these calculations are also performed on random networks,
branching trees, and known fractals, as well as fractals which have been
""rewired"" to have small-world properties. This analysis is one of many
stepping-stones in the research of neural networks. While many of the
structures and functions within the brain are known, understanding how the two
interact is also important. A firmer grasp on the structural properties of the
neural network is a key step in this process

possibly have been formed by numerous successive, slight modifications, my
theory would absolutely break down"". Can Darwinian random mutations and
selection generate biological complexity and holism? In this paper we argue
that the ""wonderful but not enough"" tools of linear reductionism cannot lead to
chaos and hence to complexity and holism, but with ChaNoXity this seems indeed
plausible, even likely. Based on the Pump-Engine realism of mutually
interacting supply and demand --- demand institutes supply that fuels demand
--- we demonstrate that the ""supply"" of symmetry breaking Darwinian genetic
variation, in direct conflict with the symmetry inducing ""demand"" of natural
selection, defines the antagonistic arrows of the real and negative worlds.
Working in this competitively collaborating nonlinear mode, these opposites
generate the homeostasy of holistic life. Protein folding, mitosis, meiosis,
hydrophobicity and other ingredients have their respective expressions in this
paradigm; nucleotide substitution, gene duplication-divergence, HGT,
stress-induced mutations, antibiotic resistance, Lamarckism would appear to fit
in naturally in this complexity paradigm defined through emergence of novelty
and self-organization.
  With obvious departures from current reductionism, this can have far reaching
implications in the Darwinian and nano medicine of genetic diseases and
disorders.
  Our goal is to chart a roadmap of adventure beyond (neo)-Darwinian
reductionism.

radioactive isotopes which are today of critical importance for upcoming dark

taking we analyze here the muon signal and its possible modulation. The muon
flux is measured to be (3.41+-0.01)E-4/m2/s. A modulation of this signal with a
yearly period is observed with an amplitude of (1.29+-0.07)% and a phase of

coupled field theory using AdS/CFT techniques. The model involves a probe
neutral scalar field with mass-squared $m^2$ in the range $-9/4 < m^2 < -3/2$
in a $AdS_4$ charged black brane background. For a given brane background there
is a critical mass-squared, $m_c^2$ such that for $m^2 < m_c^2$ the scalar
field condenses. The theory is critical when $m^2 = m_c^2$ and the source for
the dual operator vanishes. At the critical point, the radial operator for the
bulk linearized problem has a zero mode. We study the dynamics of the order
parameter with a time dependent source $J(t)$, or a null-time dependent bulk
mass $m(u)$ across the critical point. We show that in the critical region the
dynamics for an initially slow variation is dominated by the zero mode : this
leads to an effective description in terms of a Landau-Ginsburg type dynamics
with a {\em linear} time derivative. Starting with an adiabatic initial
condition in the ordered phase, we find that the order parameter drops to zero
at a time $t_\star$ which is later than the time when $(m_c^2-m^2)$ or $J$ hits
zero. In the critical region, $t_\star$, and the departure of the order
parameter from its adiabatic value, scale with the rate of change, with
exponents determined by static critical behavior. Numerical results for the
order parameter are consistent with these expectations.

proposed method can resolve arbitrarily small signals (e.g. temperature
differences) at small constant cost and thus represents a considerable
improvement compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods whose cost increases
quadratically with decreasing signal. This is achieved via a control-variate
variance reduction formulation in which the stochastic particle description
only solves for the deviation from a nearby equilibrium, while the latter is
described analytically. We also show that simulating an energy-based Boltzmann
equation results in an algorithm that lends itself naturally to exact energy
conservation thereby considerably improving the simulation fidelity.
Simulations using the proposed method are used to investigate the effect of
porosity on the effective thermal conductivity of silicon. We also present
simulations of a recently developed thermal conductivity spectroscopy process.
The latter simulations demonstrate how the computational gains introduced by
the proposed method enable the simulation of otherwise intractable multiscale

these stars are second-generation globular cluster stars that have been lost to
the halo field via normal cluster mass-loss processes. Extrapolating from

suggests that globular clusters contributed significant numbers of stars to the
construction of the Galactic halo: we calculate that a minimum of 17% of the

provides a framework for more detailed investigations, and additional

Existence of related extremal maps and continuity of squeezing functions are
proved. Holomorphic homogeneous regular domains are exactly domains whose
squeezing functions have positive lower bounds. Completeness of certain
intrinsic metrics and pseudoconvexity of holomorphic homogeneous regular
domains are proved by alternative method. In dimension one case, we get a neat
description of boundary behavior of squeezing functions of finitely connected
planar domains. This leads to a necessary and sufficient conditions for a
finitely connected planar domain to be a holomorphic homogeneous regular
domain. Consequently, we can recover some important results in complex
analysis. For annuli, we obtain some interesting properties of their squeezing
functions. We finally exhibit some examples of bounded domains whose squeezing

directly contributes to the fate as to how long the population would exist.
Muller's ratchet provides a quantitative framework to study the effect of
accumulation. Adaptive landscape as a powerful concept in system biology
provides a handle to describe complex and rare biological events. In this
article we study the evolutionary process of a population exposed to Muller's
ratchet from the new viewpoint of adaptive landscape which allows us estimate
the single click of the ratchet starting with an intuitive understanding.
  Methods: We describe how Wright-Fisher process maps to Muller's ratchet. We
analytically construct adaptive landscape from general diffusion equation. It
shows that the construction is dynamical and the adaptive landscape is
independent of the existence and normalization of the stationary distribution.
We generalize the application of diffusion model from adaptive landscape
viewpoint.
  Results: We develop a novel method to describe the dynamical behavior of the
population exposed to Muller's ratchet, and analytically derive the decaying
time of the fittest class of populations as a mean first passage time. Most
importantly, we describe the absorption phenomenon by adaptive landscape, where
the stationary distribution is non-normalizable. These results suggest the
method may be used to understand the mechanism of populations evolution and
describe the biological processes quantitatively.

this source. We found a peculiar evolution of the pulse profile during this
giant outburst, with the two main components evolving in opposite ways with
energy. A hard 30-70 mHz X-ray QPO was detected with GBM during this 2009
December giant outburst. It becomes stronger with increasing energy and
disappears at energies below 25\,keV. In the long-term a strong optical/X-ray

H$_\alpha$ EW and the V-band brightness showed an anti-correlation after
$\sim$2002 Agust. Each giant X-ray outburst occurred during a decline phase of

$\sim$\,25 days and we suggest the presence of a global one-armed oscillation
to explain this scenario. A general pattern might be inferred, where the disk
becomes weaker and shows V/R variability beginning $\sim$\,6 months following a

account for all physical phenomena, including what a moving observer must see
when performs measurement operations with moving measuring devices. We will
show that the real transformation laws are indeed identical with the ones
obtained by presuming the covariance of the equations of electrodynamics, and
that the covariance is indeed satisfied. Beforehand, however, we need to
clarify the operational definitions of the fundamental electrodynamic

symmetric local magnetic field. At low temperature, the anisotropy of the
internal magnetic field increases rapidly, with K_ab increasing faster than
that of K_c. The dominant contribution to this anisotropy arises from Sm-4f
electron contribution over that of Co-3d. The intrinsic width 2*(Beta) deviates
from linearity with respect to bulk susceptibility below 170 K due to the
enhancement of (1/T_2)dynamic, which along with the continuous increase of
anisotropy in the internal magnetic field is responsible for the wipe out
effect of the NMR signal, well above T_C. 1/T_1 shows large anisotropy
confirming a significant contribution of Sm-4f electron spin fluctuations to
1/T_1, arising from indirect RKKY type exchange interaction indicating a
non-negligible hybridization between Sm-4f orbitals and the conduction band,
over the itinerant character of the Co-3d spins. This anisotropy in originates
from the orientation dependence of chi""(q,omega). The 3d-spin fluctuations in
the ab plane is 2D FM in nature, while along the c-axis, a signature of a weak
2D AFM spin fluctuations superimposed on weak FM spin-fluctuations even in a
field of 7 T and far above T_N is observed. The enhancement of this AFM
fluctuations of the Co-3d spins along c-axis, at further low temperature is
responsible to drive the system to an AFM ordered state.

detected by the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS), at redshifts 0.4<z<0.8,
that are also part of our DAFT/FADA Survey. We analyze the ICL by applying the
OV WAV package, a wavelet-based technique, to deep HST ACS images in the F814W
filter and to V-band VLT/FORS2 images of three clusters. Detection levels are
assessed as a function of the diffuse light source surface brightness using
simulations. In the F814W filter images, we detect diffuse light sources in all
the clusters, with typical sizes of a few tens of kpc (assuming that they are
at the cluster redshifts). The ICL detected by stacking the ten F814W images
shows an 8sigma detection in the source center extending over a ~50x50kpc2
area, with a total absolute magnitude of -21.6 in the F814W filter, equivalent
to about two L* galaxies per cluster. We find a weak correlation between the
total F814W absolute magnitude of the ICL and the cluster velocity dispersion
and mass. There is no apparent correlation between the cluster mass-to-light
ratio (M/L) and the amount of ICL, and no evidence for any preferential
orientation in the ICL source distribution. We find no strong variation in the
amount of ICL between z=0 and z=0.8. In addition, we find wavelet-detected
compact objects (WDCOs) in the three clusters for which data in two bands are
available; these objects are probably very faint compact galaxies that in some
cases are members of the respective clusters. We have shown that ICL is
important in clusters at least up to z=0.8.

  arXiv:0807.0889",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, the pairing mechanism for layered HTS materials based on
attraction between electrons from adjacent layers is proposed. Initially, each
layer has expanded Fermi sphere owing to ridged geometry. When the two layers
are close enough for tunneling, it becomes energetically advantageous to form
correlated quantum states (CQS), reducing the Fermi sphere volume. Cooper
pairs, comprising inter-tunneling electrons, occupy the CQS. The image force is
responsible for the electron-electron attraction. Pair-binding energy and the
corresponding effective mass vary in a wide range. At T>0, some heavy pairs do
not condense. Such pairs are responsible for pseudogap. Light pairs get Bose
condensed and are responsible for superconductivity. The proposed mechanism
provides clarification of superconductivity in cuprates, iron based
superconductors and LSCO/LCO interfaces. It provides explanation of two energy
gaps and two characteristic temperatures in layered superconducting materials.
It also provides clarification on the Fermi surface pockets, anisotropy of
charge transport in pseudogap state, and other properties of HTS materials. The
pseudogap, estimated within the model, fits the experimental values for the
two-layer cuprates, such as YBCO, Bi2212, Tl2212, and Hg1212.

using the red clump (RC) stars and the RR Lyrae stars (RRLS). The V and I pass
bands photometric data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE
III) catalogue are used. The mean dereddened I${_0}$ magnitude and the
dispersion in the I${_0}$ magnitudes are used to estimate the relative
positions of different regions in the SMC and the line of sight (LOS) depth
across the SMC respectively. From the analysis of both the populations we found
that the north eastern part of the SMC is closer to us and the line of sight
depth across the SMC is large. The radial density profile of the RC stars
suggest that they are more likely to be distributed in a nearly spheroidal
system. An elongation along the NE-SW direction is seen in the distribution of
the RC stars. Based on these results the observed SMC is approximated as a
triaxial ellipsoidal galaxy. The parameters of the ellipsoid obtained using
both the populations are found to be similar. The above estimated parameters
depend on the data coverage of the SMC. Using the RRLS with equal coverage in
all the three axes (data within 3 degrees in X, Y and Z axes), we estimated an
axes ratio of 1:1.33:1.61 with an inclination, i = 2.6 deg and position angle
of the projection of the ellipsoid, \phi = 70.2 deg. Our tidal radius estimates
and the recent observational studies suggest that the full extent of the SMC in
the XY plane is of the order of the front to back distance estimated along the
line of sight. These results suggest that the structure of the SMC is
spheroidal or slightly ellipsoidal. We propose that the SMC experienced a
merger with another dwarf galaxy at ~ 4-5 Gyr ago, and the merger process was
completed in another 2-3 Gyr. This resulted in a spheroidal distribution
comprising of stars older than 2 Gyr.

Hamburg/ESO objective-prism survey (HES) based on identifying stars with
apparently strong CH G-band strengths for their colors. The hypothesis we
exploit is that large over-abundances of carbon are common among metal-poor
stars. The selection was made by considering two line indices in the 4300A
region, applied directly to the low-resolution prism spectra. This work also
extends a previously published method by adding bright sources to the sample.
The spectra of these stars suffer from saturation effects, compromising the
index calculations and leading to an undersampling of the brighter candidates.
Visual inspection and classification of the spectra from the HES plates yielded
a list of 5,288 new metal-poor candidates, which are presently being used as
targets for medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up. Estimates of the stellar
atmospheric parameters, as well as carbon abundances, are now available for 117
of the first candidates, based on follow-up medium-resolution spectra obtained
with the SOAR 4.1m and Gemini 8m telescopes. We demonstrate that our new method
improves the metal-poor star fractions found by our pilot study by up to a
factor of three in the same magnitude range, as compared with our pilot study
based on only one CH G-band index. Our selection scheme obtained roughly a 40%
success rate for identification of stars with [Fe/H] < -1.0; the primary
contaminant is late-type stars with near solar abundances and, often, emission
line cores that filled in the CaII K line on the prism spectrum. Because the
selection is based on carbon, we greatly increase the numbers of known CEMP
stars from the HES with intermediate metallicities -2.0 < [Fe/H] < -1.0, which
previous survey efforts undersampled. There are eight newly discovered stars
with [Fe/H] < -3.0 in our sample, including two with [Fe/H] < -3.5.

of molecular lines from complex molecules and high excitations. Even
vibrationally excited HC15N at 690 GHz is detected. The HCN abundance at high
temperatures is very high. Absorption against the dust continuum occurs in
twelve transitions, whose shape implies an outflow along the line-of-sight.

continuum and molecular line emission are resolved at 345 GHz, revealing
central flattening and rapid radial falloff of the density outwards of 10^4 AU,

detected, but modeling of the line shapes of vibrationally excited HCN suggests
the density to be clumpy. We conclude that G10.47+0.03 is characterized by
beginning of feedback from massive stars, while infall is ongoing. Large gas
masses (hundreds of Msun) are heated to high temperatures, aided by diffusion
of radiation in a high-column-density environment. The increased thermal,
radiative, turbulent, and wind-driven pressure drives expansion in the central
region and is likely responsible for the central flattening of the density.

supplemented by all possible quadratic, algebraic curvature invariants coupled

the routing process in mobile ad-hoc network environments. The main objective
of clustering is to identify suitable node representatives, i.e. cluster heads
(CHs), to store routing and topology information and maximize clusters
stability. Traditional clustering algorithms suggest CH election exclusively
based on node IDs or location information and involve frequent broadcasting of
control packets, even when network topology remains unchanged. More recent
works take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and
optimize initial clustering. However, in many situations (e.g. in relatively
static topologies) re-clustering procedure is hardly ever invoked; hence
initially elected CHs soon reach battery exhaustion. Herein, we introduce an
efficient distributed clustering algorithm that uses both mobility and energy
metrics to provide stable cluster formations. CHs are initially elected based
on the time and cost-efficient lowest-ID method. During clustering maintenance
phase though, node IDs are re-assigned according to nodes mobility and energy
status, ensuring that nodes with low-mobility and sufficient energy supply are
assigned low IDs and, hence, are elected as CHs. Our algorithm also reduces
control traffic volume since broadcast period is adjusted according to nodes
mobility pattern: we employ infrequent broadcasting for relative static network
topologies, and increase broadcast frequency for highly mobile network
configurations. Simulation results verify that energy consumption is uniformly
distributed among network nodes and that signaling overhead is significantly
decreased.

A spectacular example of this is the massive cluster NGC2808, where multiple
populations have been found along the horizontal branch (HB) and the main
sequence (MS). Studies of red giants showed that this cluster appears
homogeneous insofar Fe abundance is concerned, but it shows an extended
anticorrelation between Na and O abundances. The Na-poor, O-rich population can
be identified with the red MS, and the Na-rich, O-poor one with the blue one.
This may be understood in terms of different He content, He being correlated
with Na. A prediction of this scenario is that He-rich, Na-rich He-core burning
stars, because they are less massive, will end up on the bluer part of the HB,
while He-poor, Na-poor stars will reside on the red HB. The aim of this paper
is to verify this prediction. To this purpose, we acquired high-resolution
spectra of regions including strong O and Na lines in several tens of HB stars
of NGC2808, sampling both the red and blue parts of the HB. We limited our
analysis to those blue HB stars cooler than the gap at 11,500 K, because
diffusion and radiative pressure are known to strongly modify the atmospheric
composition of warmer stars. We indeed found a strict correspondence between
the colour of the HB stars and their Na and O abundances: all blue HB stars are
very O-poor and Na-rich. In addition, we found that while all the red HB stars
are more O-rich and Na-poor than the blue ones, there is a moderate Na-O
anticorrelation among them as well. This anticorrelation is in turn related to
the colour of the red HB stars. These results reinforce the connection between
Na and O abundances and the second parameter phenomenon, and show that there
are more than three stellar populations in NGC 2808 because only a fraction of
the red HB stars belong to the primordial population of this cluster.

turn-based stochastic multiplayer games with omega-regular objectives. We show
that restricting the search space to equilibria whose payoffs fall into a
certain interval may lead to undecidability. In particular, we prove that the
following problem is undecidable: Given a game G, does there exist a Nash
equilibrium of G where Player 0 wins with probability 1? Moreover, this problem
remains undecidable when restricted to pure strategies or (pure) strategies
with finite memory. One way to obtain a decidable variant of the problem is to
restrict the strategies to be positional or stationary. For the complexity of
these two problems, we obtain a common lower bound of NP and upper bounds of NP
and PSPACE respectively. Finally, we single out a special case of the general
problem that, in many cases, admits an efficient solution. In particular, we
prove that deciding the existence of an equilibrium in which each player either
wins or loses with probability 1 can be done in polynomial time for games where
the objective of each player is given by a parity condition with a bounded
number of priorities.

dust rims around chondrules formed in the solar nebula at elevated
temperatures. Our experimental method allows us to form dust rims around
chondrule-analogs while being levitated in an inert-gas flow. We used
micrometer-sized powdered San Carlos olivine to accrete individual dust
particles onto the chondrule-analog at a temperature of 1100{\deg}C. The
resulting dust-rims were analyzed by means of two different techniques: one
sample was investigated with non-destructive micro computer tomography, the
other with a scanning electron microscope. Both methods give very similar
results for the dust-rim structure and a mean dust-rim porosity of 60 percent,
demonstrating that both methods are equally well suited for sample analysis.
The chondrule-analog's bulk composition has no measurable effect on the
accretion efficiency of the dust. We measured the chemical composition of
chondrule-analog and dust-rim to check whether elemental exchange between the
tow components occurred. Such a reaction zone was not found, thus we can
experimentally confirm the sharp border between chondrules and dust-rims
described in the literature. The experimental dust-rim porosities and reported
porosities in carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites depend on the meteorite

geometry in the ergospheric disk (and the corresponding asymmetric powerful
jet) in 3-D perfect magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations of a
rapidly rotating black hole accretion system reported in \citet{pun10}.
Understanding, why and how these unexpected asymmetric structures form is of
practical interest because an ergospheric disk jet can boost the black hole
driven jet power many-fold possibly resolving a fundamental disconnect between
the energy flux estimates of powerful quasar jets and simulated jet power
\citep{pun11}. The new 3-D simulations of \citet{bec09} that were run with
basically the same code that was used in the simulation discussed in
\citet{pun10} describe the ""coronal mechanism"" of accreting poliodal magnetic
flux towards the event horizon. It was determined that reconnection in the
inner accretion disk is a ""necessary"" component for this process. The coronal
mechanism seems to naturally explain the asymmetric ergospheric disk field
lines that were seen in the simulations. Using examples from the literature, it
is discussed how apparently small changes in the reconnection geometry and
rates can make enormous changes in the magnetospheric flux distribution and the
resultant black hole driven jet power in a numerical simulation. Unfortunately,
reconnection is a consequence of numerical diffusion and not a detailed (yet to
be fully understood) physical mechanism in the existing suite of perfect MHD
based numerical simulations. The implication is that there is presently great
uncertainty in the flux distribution of astrophysical black hole magnetospheres
and the resultant jet power.

clusters at 0.1<z<0.3, to quantify the real aboundance of the population of
X-ray dark or underluminous clusters and at the same time the spurious
detection contamination level of color-selected cluster catalogs. A careful
selection allowed us to have an X-ray-unbiased sample of 33 clusters to measure
the Lx-richness relation. Swift 1.4 Ms X-ray observations show that at least
89% of the color-detected clusters are real objects with a potential well deep
enough to heat and retain an intracluster medium. The percentage rises to 94 %
when one includes the single spectroscopically confirmed color-selected cluster
whose X-ray emission is not secured. Looking at our results from the opposite
perspective, the percentage of X-ray dark clusters among color-selected
clusters is very low: at most about 11 per cent (at 90 % confidence).
Supplementing our data with those from literature, we conclude that X-ray- and
color- cluster surveys sample the same population and consequently that in this
regard we can safely use clusters selected with any of the two methods for
cosmological purposes. This is an essential and promising piece of information
for upcoming surveys in both the optical/IR (DES, EUCLID) and X-ray (eRosita).
Richness correlates with X-ray luminosity with a large scatter, 0.51+/-0.08
(0.44+/-0.07) dex in lgLx at a given richness, when Lx is measured in a 500
(1070) kpc aperture. We release data and software to estimate the X-ray flux,
or its upper limit, of a source with over-Poisson background fluctuations
(found in this work to be ~20% on cluster angular scales) and to fit X-ray
luminosity vs richness if there is an intrinsic scatter. These Bayesian
applications rigorously account for boundaries (e.g. the X-ray luminosity and
the richness cannot be negative).

broadened structures replacing the gaps observed in often used single super

introduce a self-energy, resulting from the scattering of randomly positioned

well described by a process of anomalous diffusion, depends qualitatively on
the interaction strength. By using scaling ideas we relate the parameter that

of dark energy models. As an example of the accurateness of the approximation
used, we compute the power spectrum of different dark energy models with
constant equation of state parameter ($w_{DE}=-0.1$, -0.5 and -0.8, ruled out
by observations but easy to compare to numerical solutions) using our

the identified user is linked to his Internet usage. We illustrate this threat

designing an importance sampling algorithm for both multi-dimensional

optimal change of measure is controlled by the mean quantization error. We
illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by pricing several options in a

mean-field theory. The high-frequency tail of the impurity self-energy is
replaced with a noise-free function determined by a dual-expansion around the
atomic limit. This method does not depend on the explicit form of the
interaction term. More advantageous, it does not introduce any additional
numerical cost to the CT-HYB simulation. We discuss the symmetries of the
two-particle vertex, which can be used to optimize the simulation of the
four-point correlation functions in the CT-HYB. Here, we adopt it to accelerate
the dual-expansion calculation, which turns out to be especially suitable for
the study of material systems with complicated band structures. As an
application, a two-orbital Anderson impurity model with a general on-site
interaction form is studied. The phase diagram is extracted as a function of
the Coulomb interactions for two different Hund's coupling strengths. In the
presence of the hybridization between different orbitals, for smaller
interaction strengths, this model shows a transition from metal to
band-insulator. Increasing the interaction strengths, this transition is
replaced by a crossover from Mott insulator to band-insulator behavior.

function \phi differ from its \mu--space average by at least \alpha. As the
measure \mu is an SRB one, the intersection of this set with the basin of
attraction of \mu should have zero Lebesgue measure.
  The \emph{special ergodic theorem}, whenever it holds, claims that, moreover,
this intersection has the Hausdorff dimension less than the dimension of M. We
prove that for Lipschitz maps, the special ergodic theorem follows from the
dynamical large deviations principle.
  Applying theorems of L. S. Young and of V. Araujo and M. J. Pacifico, we
conclude that the special ergodic theorem holds for transitive hyperbolic
attractors of C^2-diffeomorphisms, as well as for some other known classes of
maps (including the one of partially hyperbolic non-uniformly expanding maps).

patterns and small-scale structures. A large-scale field reversal may exist in
the Milky Way but no such reversals have been observed so far in external
galaxies. The effects of star-forming regions of galaxies need to be included
when modelling the evolution of their magnetic fields, which can then be
compared to future radio polarization observations. The causes of large-scale
field reversals also need clarification. Our model of field evolution in
isolated disc galaxies includes a standard mean-field dynamo and continuous
injection of turbulent fields (the effect of supernova explosions) in discrete
star forming regions by implicit small-scale dynamo action. Synthetic maps of
radio synchrotronemission and Faraday rotation measures are computed. A
large-scale dynamo is essential to obtain regular large-scale spiral magnetic
fields, observed in many galaxies. These appear, on kpc scales in near energy
equilibrium with the turbulence, after 1-2 Gyr (redshift 4-3). Turbulent field
injection generates small-scale field structures. Depending on model
parameters, large-scale field reversals may persist over many Gyrs and can
survive until the present epoch. Significant polarized radio synchrotron
emission from young galaxies is expected at redshifts less than 4. Faraday
rotation measures (RM) are crucial to detect field reversals. Large-scale
patterns ofrotation measures can be observed at redshifts less than 3. Our
model can explain the general form of axisymmetric spiral fields with many
local distortions, as observed in nearby galaxies. For a slightly different
choice of parameters, large-scale field reversals can persist over the lifetime
of a galaxy. Comparison of our synthetic maps with future observations of
distant galaxies with the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will allow
refinement of models.

intervals between neighboring pulses are distinct for both burst types and also
fit with lognormal functions. We have studied the evolution of these parameters

under local gauge transformations and that non-abelian gauge invariance can be
set up quite naturally. This leads naturally to Elko symmetry currents. These
Elko symmetry currents can then be coupled with the symmetry currents of the
Electroweak theory to form interaction Hamiltonian densities, thus providing a
natural mechanism for Elko particles to interact directly with Standard Model
matter in addition to the Higgs particle. This could have profound implications
for the detection of Elko at the LHC. We also show that in a certain sense Elko
fields are non-local even along the axis of locality. This may make direct
detection of Elko difficult. We propose that Elko would therefore still seem
dark to us, as far as direct detection efforts are concerned. We propose
however, that the allowed gauge interactions between Elko and the electroweak
sector of the Standard Model may result in the possibility of new experiments
to be devised to look for Elko indirectly via studying the Standard Model
particles that are involved in an Elko interaction. Such new experiments could
complement existing ideas of developing experiments to detect the Elko
particles based on their interaction with the Higgs particle.

is usually referred as the existence of ""dark matter particles"" of unknown
origin. An alternative explanation of the dark matter effect is presented here
by assuming that the empty space of the Universe has a complicated geometrical
structure. It is assumed that the cosmological Lambda term, which is
approximately constant at scales of several Mpc and describes the dark energy,
is not constant at scales of several tenth of Kpc and describes the ""dark
matter effect"". This term is mathematically analogous, but not identical, with
the energy-momentum tensor of particles ensembles. In this connection the
general expression of the Riemann tensor, which depends on the matter
distribution in space and on the empty space geometry, is considered. The Ricci
tensor does not describe all possible empty space structures. The tensor of the
spin curvature also has to be taken into account. Local deviations of the empty
space geometry of Universe from a flat one provide the same observational
effect as clouds of invisible particles which demonstrate themselves by their
gravitational fields only. The matter, which forms stars and galaxies, will
concentrate in gravitational depressions of empty space. The gravitation
provides correlation of the luminous matter distribution and geometrical
structures of space. The presented theory is compared with observations.
