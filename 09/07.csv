typical setup requires a temporally coherent light source. Here, we show that a
short-coherence light source can be used as well, provided that its coherence
properties are suitably modified. This results in a ""skewed-coherence"" light
beam allowing that restores the coherence requirements. This approach overcomes
the usual need for beam filtering, which would reduce the total brightness of
the beam.

solution of a static dipole with the magnetic field induced by some currents
(perturbation field), we derive the solutions of a static as well as a retarded
dipole with the perturbation field in the Cartesian coordinates. The static
(retarded) magnetic field can be expressed as the sum of pure static (retarded)
dipolar magnetic field and the static (retarded) perturbation field. We use the
solution of the retarded magnetic field to investigate the influence of the
perturbation field on the emission patterns and light curves, and we apply the
perturbed solutions to calculate the gamma-ray light curves for the case of the
Vela pulsar. We find out that the perturbation field induced by the currents
will change the emission patterns and then light curves of gamma-rays,
especially for a larger perturbation field. Our results indicate that the
perturbation field created by the outward-flowing (inward-flowing) electrons
(positrons) can decrease the rotation effect on the magnetosphere and makes
emission pattern appear to be more smooth relative to that of the pure retarded

material around young and embedded intermidiate-mass T Tauri stars (IMTTSs). We
present an analysis of the excitation and accretion properties of the young
IMTTS DK Cha. The nearly face-on configuration of this source allows us to have
direct access to the star-disk system through the excavated envelope and
outflow cavity. Based on LR optical and IR spectroscopy obtained with
SofI/EFOSC2 on the NTT we derive the spectrum of DK Cha from ~0.6 to 2.5 \mu m.
From the detected lines we probe the conditions of the gas that emits the HI IR
emission lines. In addition, we derive the mass accretion rate (Macc) from the
relationships that connect the luminosity of the Br\gamma\ and Pa\beta\ lines
with the accretion luminosity (Lacc). The observed optical/IR spectrum is
extremely rich in forbidden and permitted atomic and molecular emission lines,
which makes this source similar to very active low-mass T Tauri stars. Some of
the permitted emission lines are identified as being excited by fluorescence.
We derive Brackett decrements and compare them with different excitation
mechanisms. The Pa\beta/Br\gamma\ ratio is consistent with optically thick
emission in LTE at a temperature of ~3500 K, originated from a compact region
of ~5 Rsun in size: but the line opacity decreases in the Br lines for high
quantum numbers n_{up}. A good fit to the data is obtained assuming an
expanding gas in LTE, with an electron density at the wind base of ~10^13 cm-3.
In addition, we find that the observed Brackett ratios are very similar to
those reported in previous studies of low-mass CTTSs and Class I sources,
indicating that these ratios are not dependent on masses and ages. Finally,
Lacc~9 Lsun and Macc~3x10-7 Msun/yr values were found.

Computations of the band structures in the presence of a magnetic field are
carried out employing five-level {\Pp} model appropriate for medium-gap

to bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) of the materials. The resulting theoretical
effective masses and $g$ factors increase with electron energy due to band
nonparabolicity. Average $g$ values are calculated summing over populated
Landau and spin levels properly accounting for the thermal distribution of

calculations are in good agreement with experiment in the temperature range of
0 K to 300 K for CdTe and 0 K to 180 K for InP. The temperature dependence of
$g$ is stronger in CdTe than in InP due to different signs of the band-edge $g$

equals the one for percolation on the complete graph or Erdos-Renyi random
graph, raising the question whether the scaling limits of the largest connected

  In this paper, we investigate the cycle structure of the largest critical
components for high-dimensional percolation on the torus (Z/rZ)^d. While
percolation clusters naturally have many short cycles, we show that the long
cycles, i.e., cycles that pass through the boundary of the cube of width r/4
centered around each of their vertices, have length of order r^{d/3}, as on the
critical Erdos-Renyi random graph. On the Erdos-Renyi random graph, cycles play
an essential role in the scaling limit of the large critical clusters, as
identified by Addario-Berry, Broutin and Goldschmidt (arXiv:0908.3629).
  Our proofs crucially rely on various new estimates of probabilities of the
existence of open paths in critical Bernoulli percolation on Z^d with
constraints on their lengths. We believe these estimates are interesting in

with interference -- the unwanted signals being sent by transmitters that a
receiver is not interested in. This thesis looks at ways of combating such
interference.
  In Chapters 1 and 2, we outline the necessary information and communication
theory background, including the concept of capacity. We also include an
overview of a new set of schemes for dealing with interference known as
interference alignment, paying special attention to a channel-state-based
strategy called ergodic interference alignment.
  In Chapter 3, we consider the operation of large regular and random networks
by treating interference as background noise. We consider the local performance
of a single node, and the global performance of a very large network.
  In Chapter 4, we use ergodic interference alignment to derive the asymptotic
sum-capacity of large random dense networks. These networks are derived from a
physical model of node placement where signal strength decays over the distance
between transmitters and receivers. (See also arXiv:1002.0235 and
arXiv:0907.5165.)
  In Chapter 5, we look at methods of reducing the long time delays incurred by
ergodic interference alignment. We analyse the tradeoff between reducing delay
and lowering the communication rate. (See also arXiv:1004.0208.)
  In Chapter 6, we outline a problem that is equivalent to the problem of
pooled group testing for defective items. We then present some new work that
uses information theoretic techniques to attack group testing. We introduce for
the first time the concept of the group testing channel, which allows for
modelling of a wide range of statistical error models for testing. We derive
new results on the number of tests required to accurately detect defective
items, including when using sequential `adaptive' tests.

often incorrectly ascribed to a reduction in variance. We argue that the
underlying source of the diversification return is the rebalancing, which
forces the investor to sell assets that have appreciated in relative value and
buy assets that have declined in relative value, as measured by their weights
in the portfolio. In contrast, the incremental return of a buy-and-hold
portfolio is driven by the fact that the assets that perform the best become a
greater fraction of the portfolio. We use these results to resolve two puzzles
associated with the Gorton and Rouwenhorst index of commodity futures, and
thereby obtain a clear understanding of the source of the return of that index.
Diversification return can be a significant source of return for any rebalanced

are typically provided by highly optimized libraries that implement the BLAS
(Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) interface. In C++ templates and operator
overloading allow the implementation of these vector operations as expression
templates which construct custom loops at compile time and providing a more
abstract interface. Unfortunately existing expression template libraries lack
the performance of fast BLAS(Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) implementations.
This paper presents a new approach - Statically Accelerated Loop Templates
(SALT) - to close this performance gap by combining expression templates with
an aggressive loop unrolling technique. Benchmarks were conducted using the
Intel C++ compiler and GNU Compiler Collection to assess the performance of our
library relative to Intel's Math Kernel Library as well as the Eigen template
library. The results show that the approach is able to provide optimization
comparable to the fastest available BLAS implementations, while retaining the
convenience and flexibility of a template library.

emission lines of low-excitation species that are composed of narrow and broad
components, related to two regions with different kinematics, densities, and
temperatures. The photospheric spectrum is often veiled by an excess continuous
emission. This veiling is usually attributed to radiation from a heated region
beneath the accretion shock. The aim of this research is to clarify the nature
of the veiling, and whether the narrow chromospheric lines of Fe I and other
metals represent a standard chromosphere of a late-type star, or are induced by
mass accretion. From high-resolution spectroscopy of DR Tauri we found that the
amount of veiling in this star varies from practically nothing to factors more
than 10 times the stellar continuum intensity, and that the veiling is caused
by both a non-photospheric continuum and chromospheric line emission filling in
the photospheric absorption lines. This effect can be shown to exist in several
other T Tauri stars. We conclude that enhanced chromospheric emission in cTTS
is linked not only to solar-like magnetic activity, but is powered to a greater
extent by the accreting gas. We suggest that the area of enhanced chromospheric
emission is induced by mass accretion, which modifies the local structure of
stellar atmosphere in an area that is more extended than the hot accretion
spot. The narrow emission lines from this extended area are responsible for the
extra component in the veiling through line-filling of photospheric absorption
lines.

discussed as an astrophysical phenomenon in two papers published in 1978. We
published the first (Gregory and Thompson 1978) and Joeveer, Einasto and Tago
(1978) published the second. The discovery of voids altered the accepted view
of the large scale structure of the universe. In the old picture, the universe
was filled with field galaxies, and occasional density enhancements could be
found at the locations of rich galaxy clusters or superclusters. In the new
picture, voids are interspersed between complex filamentary supercluster
structure that forms the so-called cosmic web. The key observational
prerequisite for the discovery of voids was a wide-angle redshift survey
displayed as a cone diagram that extended far enough in distance to show a fair
sample of the universe (i.e., well beyond the Local Supercluster). The initial
impact of the 1978 discovery of voids was stunted for several years by
theoretical cosmologists in the West who were not quite sure how filaments and
voids could emerge from what otherwise appeared to be a homogeneous universe.
After it became clear several years later that theoretical models of structure
formation could explain the phenomenon, the new void and supercluster paradigm
became widely accepted.

allows us to construct finite abstractions through polyhedral operations. The
correctness of the model with respect to temporal logic specifications can then
be verified automatically using methods inspired by model checking.
  Overall, our procedure is conservative but it can filter through a large

similar to low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). Here we
investigate the nature of the ionizing sources powering this emission, by
comparing nuclear spectroscopy from the Palomar survey with larger aperture
data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find the line emission in the
majority of passive red galaxies is spatially extended; the Halpha surface
brightness profile depends on radius (r) as r^(-1.28). We detect strong line
ratio gradients with radius in [N II]/Ha, [S II]/Ha, and [O III]/[S II],
requiring the ionization parameter to increase outwards. Combined with a
realistic gas density profile, this outward increasing ionization parameter
convincingly rules out AGN as the dominant ionizing source, and strongly favors
distributed ionizing sources. Sources that follow the stellar density profile
can additionally reproduce the observed luminosity-dependence of the line ratio
gradient. Post-AGB stars provide a natural ionization source candidate, though
they have an ionization parameter deficit. Velocity width differences among
different emission lines disfavor shocks as the dominant ionization mechanism,
and suggest that the interstellar medium in these galaxies contains multiple
components. We conclude that the line emission in most LINER-like galaxies
found in large aperture (>100pc) spectroscopy is not primarily powered by AGN
activity and thus does not trace the AGN bolometric luminosity. However, they
can be used to trace warm gas in these red galaxies.

hydrodynamics. This allows us to assess the impact of hydro-solver
uncertainties on the results of cosmological studies of galaxy formation. We
focus on predictions for global baryon statistics, such as the cosmic star
formation rate density, after we introduce our simulation suite and numerical
methods. Properties of individual galaxies and haloes are examined by Keres et
al. (2011), while a third paper by Sijacki et al. (2011) uses idealised
simulations to analyse the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. We
find that the global baryon statistics differ significantly between the two
simulation approaches. AREPO shows higher star formation rates at late times,
lower mean temperatures, and different gas mass fractions in characteristic
phases of the intergalactic medium, in particular a reduced amount of hot gas.
Although both codes use the same implementation of cooling, more gas cools out
of haloes in AREPO compared with GADGET towards low redshifts. We show that
this is caused by a higher heating rate with SPH in the outer parts of haloes,
owing to viscous dissipation of SPH's inherent sonic velocity noise and SPH's
efficient damping of subsonic turbulence injected in the halo infall region,
and because of a higher efficiency of gas stripping in AREPO. As a result of
such differences, AREPO leads also to more disk-like morphologies compared to
GADGET. Our results indicate that inaccuracies in hydrodynamic solvers can lead
to comparatively large systematic differences.

epoch of reionization (EoR) are considered to constitute the most promising
tool to probe that epoch. One of the major goals of the first generation of low
frequency radio telescopes is to measure the 3D 21-cm power spectrum. However,
the 21-cm signal could evolve substantially along the line of sight (LOS)
direction of an observed 3D volume, since the received signal from different
planes transverse to the LOS originated from different look-back times and
could therefore be statistically different. Using numerical simulations we
investigate this so-called light cone effect on the spherically averaged 3D
21-cm power spectrum. For this version of the power spectrum, we find that the
effect mostly `averages out' and observe a smaller change in the power spectrum
compared to the amount of evolution in the mean 21-cm signal and its rms
variations along the LOS direction. Nevertheless, changes up to 50% at large
scales are possible. In general the power is enhanced/suppressed at large/small
scales when the effect is included. The cross-over mode below/above which the
power is enhanced/suppressed moves toward larger scales as reionization
proceeds. When considering the 3D power spectrum we find it to be anisotropic
at the late stages of reionization and on large scales. The effect is dominated
by the evolution of the ionized fraction of hydrogen during reionization and
including peculiar velocities hardly changes these conclusions. We present
simple analytical models which explain qualitatively all the features we see in
the simulations.

the MTI is generally additive to other sources of turbulence in the ICM, such
as that produced by structure formation. This new source of non-thermal

SKIRT. Our approach of generating clumpy structure allows us to model tori with
single clumps, complex structures of merged clumps or interconnected

innermost region, all have an impact on the shape of near- and mid-infrared

models with smooth dust distribution are also able to produce a wide range of

stellar time. We observe the existence of fast, downward flowing plumes that
are able to transport hydrogen into close proximity to the helium burning shell
before burning takes place. The intershell in the 3D model is richer in protons
than the 1D model by several orders of magnitude and so we obtain substantially
higher hydrogen-burning luminosities -- over 10^8 solar luminosities in the
high resolution simulation -- than are found in the 1D model. Convective
velocities in these simulations are over 10 times greater than the predictions
of mixing length theory, though the 3D simulations have greater energy
generation due to the enhanced hydrogen burning. We find no evidence of the
convective zone splitting into two, though this could be as a result of
insufficient spatial resolution or because the models have not been evolved for
long enough. We suggest that the 1D mixing length theory and particularly the
use of a diffusion algorithm for mixing do not give an accurate picture of
these events. An advective mixing scheme may give a better representation of
the transport processes seen in the 3D models.

pairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. Our result is
primarily due to an enhancement of AGN activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)

kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. This study
demonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for black

method to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or the

flexibility in their conceptions of light and matter. We have developed a
framework for understanding and characterizing student perspectives on the
physical interpretation of quantum mechanics, and demonstrate the differential
impact on student thinking of the myriad ways instructors approach interpretive
themes in their introductory courses. Like expert physicists, students
interpret quantum phenomena differently, and these interpretations are
significantly influenced by their overall stances on questions central to the
so-called measurement problem: Is the wave function physically real, or simply
a mathematical tool? Is the collapse of the wave function an ad hoc rule, or a
physical transition not described by any equation? Does an electron, being a
form of matter, exist as a localized particle at all times? These questions,
which are of personal and academic interest to our students, are largely only
superficially addressed in our introductory courses, often for fear of opening
a Pandora's Box of student questions, none of which have easy answers. We show
how a transformed modern physics curriculum (recently implemented at the
University of Colorado) may positively impact student perspectives on
indeterminacy and wave-particle duality, by making questions of classical and

which results in the spread of lesions beyond the region where the initial

particular we represent the ""balancing act"" between pro-inflammatory and
anti-inflammatory cytokines that is hypothesized to be a principal mechanism in
the expansion properties of cartilage damage during the typical injury
response. We present preliminary results of in vitro studies that confirm the
anti-inflammatory activities of the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). We assume
that the diffusion of cytokines determine the spatial behaviour of injury
response and lesion expansion so that a reaction-diffusion system involving
chemical species and chondrocyte cell state population densities is a natural
way to represent cartilage injury response. We present computational results
using the mathematical model showing that our representation is successful in
capturing much of the interesting spatial behaviour of injury associated lesion
development and abatement in articular cartilage. Further, we discuss the use
of this model to study the possibility of using EPO as a therapy for reducing
the amount of inflammation induced collateral damage to cartilage during the
typical injury response. The mathematical model presented herein suggests that
not only are anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as EPO necessary to prevent
chondrocytes signaled by pro-inflammatory cytokines from entering apoptosis,
they may also influence how chondrocytes respond to signaling by

of a sunspot penumbra provide direct evidence for overturning convection,
adding to earlier strong indications of convection from filament dynamics
observed far from solar disk center, and supporting recent simulations of
sunspots.
  Aims. Using spectropolarimetric observations obtained at a spatial resolution
approaching 0'.'1 with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and its
spectropolarimeter CRISP, we investigate whether the convective downflows
recently discovered in the C i line at 538.03 nm can also be detected in the
wings of the Fe i line at 630.15 nm
  Methods. We make azimuthal fits of the measured LOS velocities in the core
and wings of the 538 nm and 630 nm lines to disentangle the vertical and
horizontal flows. To investigate how these depend on the continuum intensity,
the azimuthal fits are made separately for each intensity bin. By using
spatially high-pass filtered measurements of the LOS component of the magnetic
field, the flow properties are determined separately for magnetic spines
(relatively strong and vertical field) and inter-spines (weaker and more
horizontal field).
  Results. The dark convective downflows discovered recently in the 538.03 nm
line are evident also in the 630.15 nm line, and have similar strength. This
convective signature is the same in spines and inter-spines. However, the
strong radial (Evershed) outflows are found only in the inter-spines.
  Conclusions. At the spatial resolution of the present SST/CRISP data, the
small-scale intensity pattern seen in continuum images is strongly related to a
convective up/down flow pattern that exists everywhere in the penumbra. Earlier
failures to detect the dark convective downflows in the interior penumbra can
be explained by inadequate spatial resolution in the observed data.

spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological model filled of a
fluid of dark energy (DE) with constant equation of state (EOS) parameter
interacting with dark matter (DM). The reconstruction method is based on
expansions of the general interaction term and the relevant cosmological
variables in terms of Chebyshev polynomials which form a complete set
orthonormal functions. This interaction term describes an exchange of energy
flow between the DE and DM within dark sector. To show how the method works we
do the reconstruction of the interaction function expanding it in terms of only
the first six Chebyshev polynomials and obtain the best estimation for the
coefficients of the expansion assuming three models: (a) a DE equation of the
state parameter $w =-1$ (an interacting cosmological $\Lambda$), (b) a DE
equation of the state parameter $w =$ constant with a dark matter density
parameter fixed, (c) a DE equation of the state parameter $w =$ constant with a
free constant dark matter density parameter to be estimated, and using the
Union2 SNe Ia data set from ""The Supernova Cosmology Project"" (SCP) composed by
557 type Ia supernovae. In both cases, the preliminary reconstruction shows
that in the best scenario there exist the possibility of a crossing of the
noninteracting line Q=0 in the recent past within the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$
errors from positive values at early times to negative values at late times.
This means that, in this reconstruction, there is an energy transfer from DE to
DM at early times and an energy transfer from DM to DE at late times. We
conclude that this fact is an indication of the possible existence of a
crossing behavior in a general interaction coupling between dark components.

in new observations of 5 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Nearby

SNe obtained before +2.5 d relative to maximum. Detections are based on the
presence of relatively strong C II 6580 absorption ""notches"" in multiple
spectra of each SN, aided by automated fitting with the SYNAPPS code. Four of
the 5 SNe in question are otherwise spectroscopically unremarkable, with ions
and ejection velocities typical of SNe Ia, but spectra of the fifth exhibits
high-velocity (v > 20,000 km/s) Si II and Ca II features. On the other hand,
the light curve properties are preferentially grouped, strongly suggesting a
connection between carbon-positivity and broad band light curve/color behavior:
Three of the 5 have relatively narrow light curves but also blue colors, and a
fourth may be a dust-reddened member of this family. Accounting for
signal-to-noise and phase, we estimate that 22 +10/-6% of SNe Ia exhibit
spectroscopic C II signatures as late as -5 d with respect to maximum. We place
these new objects in the context of previously recognized carbon-positive SNe
Ia, and consider reasonable scenarios seeking to explain a physical connection
between light curve properties and the presence of photospheric carbon. We also
examine the detailed evolution of the detected carbon signatures and the
surrounding wavelength regions to shed light on the distribution of carbon in
the ejecta. Our ability to reconstruct the C II 6580 feature in detail under
the assumption of purely spherical symmetry casts doubt on a ""carbon blobs""
hypothesis, but does not rule out all asymmetric models. A low volume filling
factor for carbon, combined with line-of-sight effects, seems unlikely to
explain the scarcity of detected carbon in SNe Ia by itself.

understood as a tendency for polyhedra to maximize face-to-face alignment,

to the sample facilitate fast approximate processing of queries posed over the

  Our work targets data sets such as request and traffic logs and sensor
measurements, where data is repeatedly collected over multiple {\em instances}:
time periods, locations, or snapshots.
  We are interested in queries that span multiple instances, such as distinct
counts and distance measures over selected records. These queries are used for
applications ranging from planning to anomaly and change detection.
  Unbiased low-variance estimators are particularly effective as the relative
error decreases with the number of selected record keys.
  The Horvitz-Thompson estimator, known to minimize variance for sampling with
""all or nothing"" outcomes (which reveals exacts value or no information on
estimated quantity), is not optimal for multi-instance operations for which an
outcome may provide partial information.
  We present a general principled methodology for the derivation of (Pareto)
optimal unbiased estimators over sampled instances and aim to understand its

is clearly detected in both objects, thus facilitating a relatively accurate
measurement (10--20% uncertainties) of the observed rest-frame equivalent
widths, which are around 160 Angstroms for both objects. Through detailed
modelling of the profile of the Lyman alpha line with a 3-D Monte-Carlo
radiative transfer code, we estimate the intrinsic rest-frame equivalent width
of Lyman alpha and find values that are around 300 Angstroms, which is at the
upper end of the range allowed for very young, moderately metal-poor
star-forming galaxies. However, the uncertainties are large and values as high
as 700 Angstroms are permitted by the data. Both Lyman alpha emitters are
detected at 3.6 micron in deep images taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope.
We use these measurements, the measurement of the continuum red-ward of Lyman
alpha and other photometry to constrain the spectral energy distributions of
these very luminous Lyman alpha emitters and to compare them to three similar
Lyman alpha emitters from the literature. The contribution from nebular
emission is included in our models: excluding it results in significantly
higher masses. Evidence for dust is found in all objects, and emission from
nebular lines often make a dominant contribution to the rest frame 3.6 micron
flux. Rich in emission lines, these objects are prime targets for the next
generation of extremely large telescopes, JWST and ALMA.

multiplicative rather than just additive norm inequalities. These inequalities
are natural extensions of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities which, in

fundamental concepts in plasma physics. While the former describes the
surprising damping of linear plasma waves in a collisionless plasma, the latter
describes exact undamped nonlinear solutions of the Vlasov equation. There does
exist a relationship between the two: Landau damping can be described as the
phase-mixing of undamped eigenmodes, the so-called Case-Van Kampen modes, which
can be viewed as BGK modes in the linear limit. While these concepts have been
around for a long time, unexpected new results are still being discovered. For
Landau damping, we show that the textbook picture of phase-mixing is altered
profoundly in the presence of collision. In particular, the continuous spectrum
of Case-Van Kampen modes is eliminated and replaced by a discrete spectrum,
even in the limit of zero collision. Furthermore, we show that these discrete
eigenmodes form a complete set of solutions. Landau-damped solutions are then
recovered as true eigenmodes (which they are not in the collisionless theory).
For BGK modes, our interest is motivated by recent discoveries of electrostatic
solitary waves in magnetospheric plasmas. While one-dimensional BGK theory is
quite mature, there appear to be no exact three-dimensional solutions in the
literature (except for the limiting case when the magnetic field is
sufficiently strong so that one can apply the guiding-center approximation). We
show, in fact, that two- and three-dimensional solutions that depend only on
energy do not exist. However, if solutions depend on both energy and angular
momentum, we can construct exact three-dimensional solutions for the
unmagnetized case, and two-dimensional solutions for the case with a finite
magnetic field. The latter are shown to be exact, fully electromagnetic
solutions of the steady-state Vlasov-Poisson-Amp\`ere system.

Mahoney","Localization on low-order eigenvectors of data matrices","21 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.DM cs.CE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Eigenvector localization refers to the situation when most of the components
of an eigenvector are zero or near-zero. This phenomenon has been observed on
eigenvectors associated with extremal eigenvalues, and in many of those cases
it can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of ""structural heterogeneities"" in
the data. For example, the largest eigenvectors of adjacency matrices of large
complex networks often have most of their mass localized on high-degree nodes;
and the smallest eigenvectors of the Laplacians of such networks are often
localized on small but meaningful community-like sets of nodes. Here, we
describe localization associated with low-order eigenvectors, i.e.,
eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues that are not extremal but that are
""buried"" further down in the spectrum. Although we have observed it in several
unrelated applications, this phenomenon of low-order eigenvector localization
defies common intuitions and simple explanations, and it creates serious
difficulties for the applicability of popular eigenvector-based machine
learning and data analysis tools. After describing two examples where low-order
eigenvector localization arises, we present a very simple model that
qualitatively reproduces several of the empirically-observed results. This
model suggests certain coarse structural similarities among the
seemingly-unrelated applications where we have observed low-order eigenvector
localization, and it may be used as a diagnostic tool to help extract insight
from data graphs when such low-order eigenvector localization is present.

superconductors are to clarify the shape of the Fermi surfaces and the origin
of the pseudogap. On the basis of the model proposed by Kamimura and Suwa,
which bears important features originating from the interplay of Jahn-Teller
physics and Mott physics, the feature of Fermi surfaces in underdoped cuprates
is the presence of Fermi pockets constructed from doped holes under the
coexistence of a metallic state and a local antiferromagnetic order. Below
$T_{\rm c}$, the holes on Fermi pockets form Cooper pairs with d-wave symmetry
in the nodal region. In the antinodal region, there are no Fermi surfaces. In
this study we calculate the energy distribution curves (EDCs) of angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) below $T_{\rm c}$. It is shown that the
feature of ARPES profiles of underdoped cuprates consists of a coherent peak in
the nodal region and real transitions of photoexcited electrons from occupied
states below the Fermi level to a free-electron state above the vacuum level in
the antinodal region, where the latter transitions form a broad hump. From this
feature, the origin of the two distinct gaps observed by ARPES is elucidated
without introducing the concept of the pseudogap. Finally, a remark is made on
the phase diagram of underdoped cuprates.

congruence under an appropriate condition for the cooperation operator of
Bio-PEPA. The condition requires that there is no synchronisation over fast
actions, and this distinguishes fast-slow bisimilarity from weak bisimilarity.
We also show congruence for an operator which extends the reactions available
for a species. We characterise models for which it is only necessary to
consider the matching of slow transitions and we illustrate the equivalence on
two models of competitive inhibition.

led to an interesting characterization of osteoporosis as a defective bone
remodeling dynamics with respect to other bone pathologies. Our approach allows
to derive three types of model checking-based diagnostic estimators. The first
diagnostic measure focuses on the level of bone mineral density, which is
currently used in medical practice. In addition, we have introduced a novel
diagnostic estimator which uses the full patient clinical record, here
simulated using the modeling framework. This estimator detects rapid (months)
negative changes in bone mineral density. Independently of the actual bone
mineral density, when the decrease occurs rapidly it is important to alarm the
patient and monitor him/her more closely to detect insurgence of other bone
co-morbidities. A third estimator takes into account the variance of the bone
density, which could address the investigation of metabolic syndromes, diabetes
and cancer. Our implementation could make use of different logical combinations
of these statistical estimators and could incorporate other biomarkers for
other systemic co-morbidities (for example diabetes and thalassemia). We are
delighted to report that the combination of stochastic modeling with formal
methods motivate new diagnostic framework for complex pathologies. In
particular our approach takes into consideration important properties of
biosystems such as multiscale and self-adaptiveness. The multi-diagnosis could
be further expanded, inching towards the complexity of human diseases. Finally,
we briefly introduce self-adaptiveness in formal methods which is a key
property in the regulative mechanisms of biological systems and well known in

removal of angular momentum from collapsing molecular cloud cores. Hall
diffusion is known to be important to the magnetic field behaviour at many of
the intermediate densities and field strengths encountered during the
gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores into protostars, and yet its
role in the star formation process is not well-studied. We present a
semianalytic self-similar model of the collapse of rotating isothermal
molecular cloud cores with both Hall and ambipolar diffusion, and similarity
solutions that demonstrate the profound influence of the Hall effect on the
dynamics of collapse.
  The solutions show that the size and sign of the Hall parameter can change
the size of the protostellar disc by up to an order of magnitude and the
protostellar accretion rate by fifty per cent when the ratio of the Hall to
ambipolar diffusivities is varied between -0.5 <= eta_H / eta_A <= 0.2. These
changes depend upon the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the
axis of rotation and create a preferred handedness to the solutions that could
be observed in protostellar cores using next-generation instruments such as
ALMA.
  Hall diffusion also determines the strength and position of the shocks that
bound the pseudo and rotationally-supported discs, and can introduce subshocks
that further slow accretion onto the protostar. In cores that are not initially
rotating Hall diffusion can even induce rotation, which could give rise to disc
formation and resolve the magnetic braking catastrophe. The Hall effect clearly
influences the dynamics of gravitational collapse and its role in controlling
the magnetic braking and radial diffusion of the field merits further
exploration in numerical simulations of star formation.

We decompose the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) low-resolution 5-38micron
spectra of the LIRGs into AGN and starburst components using clumpy torus
models and star-forming galaxy templates, respectively. We find that 50%
(25/50) of local LIRGs have an AGN component detected with this method. There
is good agreement between these AGN detections through mid-IR spectral
decomposition and other AGN indicators, such as the optical spectral class,
mid-IR spectral features and X-ray properties. Taking all the AGN indicators
together, the AGN detection rate in the individual nuclei of LIRGs is ~62%. The
derived AGN bolometric luminosities are in the range L_bol(AGN)=0.4 -50x10^{43}
erg/s. The AGN bolometric contribution to the IR luminosities of the galaxies
is generally small, with 70% of LIRGs having L_bol(AGN)/L_IR<0.05. Only ~8% of
local LIRGs have a significant AGN bolometric contribution L_bol(AGN)/L_IR >
0.25. From the comparison of our results with literature results of
ultraluminous infrared galaxies, we confirm that in the local universe the AGN
bolometric contribution to the IR luminosity increases with the IR luminosity
of the galaxy/system. If we add up the AGN bolometric luminosities we find that
AGNs only account for 5%^{+8%}_{-3%} of the total IR luminosity produced by
local LIRGs (with and without AGN detections). This proves that the bulk of the
IR luminosity of local LIRGs is due to star formation activity. Taking the
newly determined IR luminosity density of LIRGs in the local universe, we then
estimate an AGN IR luminosity density of Omega_IR(AGN) = 3x10^5 L_sun Mpc^{-3}$

complementarily. As already reported by Nakahira et al. (2010) MAXI monitored
the source continuously throughout the entire outburst for about eight months.
All the MAXI/GSC energy spectra in the high/soft state lasting for 2 months are
well represented by a multi-color disk plus power-law model. The innermost disk
temperature changed from $\sim$0.7 keV to $\sim$0.4 keV and the disk flux
decreased by an order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the innermost radius is
constant at $\sim$41 $D_{3.5}(\cos{\it i})^{-1/2}$ km, where $D_{3.5}$ is the
source distance in units of 3.5 kpc and $i$ the inclination. The multi-color
disk parameters obtained with the MAXI/GSC are consistent with those with the
Swift/XRT and Suzaku. The Suzaku data also suggests a possibility that the disk
emission is slightly Comptonized, which could account for broad iron-K features
reported previously. Assuming that the obtained innermost radius represents the
innermost stable circular orbit for a non-rotating black hole, we estimate the
mass of the black hole to be 5.51$\pm$0.28 $M_{\odot}$ $D_{3.5}(\cos{\it
i})^{-1/2}$, where the correction for the stress-free inner boundary condition
and color hardening factor of 1.7 are taken into account. If the inclination is
less than 49$^{\circ}$ as suggested from the radio monitoring of transient jets
and the soft-to-hard transition in 2010 April occurred at 1--4% of Eddignton
luminosity, the fitting of the Suzaku spectra with a relativistic
accretion-disk model derives constraints on the mass and the distance to be
3.1--55 $M_{\odot}$ and 2.3--22 {\rm kpc}, respectively. This confirms that the
compact object in XTE J1752--223 is a black hole.

approach is exhibited. The expression of the one-loop effective action in

The present paper deals with some recurrence formulae for the generalization of

numbers satisfy certain recurrence relationships which are used in many
computations involving poly-Bernoulli numbers. Obtaining a closed formula for
generalization of poly-Bernoulli numbers with a,b,c paramerers therefore seems
to be a natural and important problem. By using the generalization of
poly-Bernoulli polynomials with a,b,c parameters of negative index we define
symmetrized generalization of poly-Bernoulli polynomials with a,b parameters of
two variables and we prove duality property for them. Also by stirling numbers
of the second kind we will find a closed formula for them. Furthermore we
generalize the Arakawa-Kaneko Zeta functions and by using the Laplace-Mellin
integral, we define generalization of Arakawa-Kaneko Zeta functions with a,b
parameters and we obtain an interpolation formula for the generalization of
poly-Bernoulli numbers and polynomials with a,b parameters. Furthermore we
present a link between this type of Zeta functions and Dirichlet series. By our
interpolation formula, we will interpolate the generalization of Arakawa-Kaneko

37 galaxies which show non-thermal ionisation (AGNs). We have examined the

between radial velocities of components lie within 200 - 400 km/s for galaxies
of both subsamples. The equivalent number of ionising stars is in the range
10^4 - 10^5 O7V stars for each component in the galaxies of Sample A. We have
estimated the oxygen and nitrogen abundances as well as the electron
temperatures for each component using the recent NS-calibration and from global
spectra for galaxies from Sample A using both the NS and ON-calibration. We
have found that the global oxygen abundance is typically in between the
measured abundances of individual components for our sample of galaxies, and
that both calibrations provide consistent global abundances. Finally, we

considerations. For example, user profiles, ratings, history, or sensor
readings can represent this case. This problem is difficult, because there is
no possibility to learn local models, the system model offers almost no

Here we propose gossip learning, a generic approach that is based on multiple
models taking random walks over the network in parallel, while applying an
online learning algorithm to improve themselves, and getting combined via
ensemble learning methods. We present an instantiation of this approach for the
case of classification with linear models. Our main contribution is an ensemble
learning method which---through the continuous combination of the models in the
network---implements a virtual weighted voting mechanism over an exponential
number of models at practically no extra cost as compared to independent random
walks. We prove the convergence of the method theoretically, and perform
extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Our experimental analysis
demonstrates the performance and robustness of the proposed approach.

monodromy, we determine the homology classes and the associated spectra after
flux breaking for each case. Our analysis includes the GUT singlets which have
hitherto been ignored but which play a crucial role in phenomenology. Using
these results we construct an E_6 based model that demonstrates, for the first
time, that it is possible to construct a phenomenologically viable model which
leads to the MSSM at low energies. The exotics that result from flux breaking
all get a large mass when singlet fields acquire vacuum expectation values
driven by D- and F-flatness. Due to the underlying GUT symmetry and the U(1)s
descending from E_8, bare baryon- and lepton-number violating terms are
forbidden up to and including dimension 5. As a result nucleon decay is
naturally suppressed below present bounds. The mu-term is forbidden by the U(1)
but is generated at the SUSY breaking scale when a further singlet field
acquires a TeV scale vacuum expectation value, driven by the spontaneous
breaking of the electroweak symmetry. After including the effect of flux and
instanton corrections acceptable quark and charged lepton masses and mixing
angles can be obtained. Neutrinos get a mass from the see-saw mechanism through
their coupling to singlet neutrinos that acquire large Majorana mass as a

known that too much parallelism can be even worse for performance than too
little, because spawning a task to be run on another CPU incurs overheads.
Autoparallelizing compilers have therefore long tried to use granularity
analysis to ensure that they only spawn off computations whose cost will
probably exceed the spawn-off cost by a comfortable margin. However, this is
not enough to yield good results, because data dependencies may \emph{also}
limit the usefulness of running computations in parallel. If one computation
blocks almost immediately and can resume only after another has completed its
work, then the cost of parallelization again exceeds the benefit.
  We present a set of algorithms for recognizing places in a program where it
is worthwhile to execute two or more computations in parallel that pay
attention to the second of these issues as well as the first. Our system uses
profiling information to compute the times at which a procedure call consumes
the values of its input arguments and the times at which it produces the values
of its output arguments. Given two calls that may be executed in parallel, our
system uses the times of production and consumption of the variables they share
to determine how much their executions would overlap if they were run in
parallel, and therefore whether executing them in parallel is a good idea or
not.
  We have implemented this technique for Mercury in the form of a tool that
uses profiling data to generate recommendations about what to parallelize, for
the Mercury compiler to apply on the next compilation of the program. We
present preliminary results that show that this technique can yield useful
parallelization speedups, while requiring nothing more from the programmer than
representative input data for the profiling run.

discriminants initiated by B\'ezout, Cayley and Sylvester in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, and emphasized in the latest years due to the increase of
computing power, we focus on the implicitization of hypersurfaces in several
contexts. Our approach is based on the use of linear syzygies by means of
approximation complexes, following [Bus\'e Jouanolou 03], where they develop
the theory for a rational map $f:P^{n-1}\dashrightarrow P^n$. Approximation
complexes were first introduced by Herzog, Simis and Vasconcelos in [Herzog
Simis Vasconcelos 82] almost 30 years ago. The main obstruction for this
approximation complex-based method comes from the bad behavior of the base
locus of $f$. Thus, it is natural to try different compatifications of
$A^{n-1}$, that are better suited to the map $f$, in order to avoid unwanted
base points. With this purpose, in this thesis we study toric compactifications
$T$ for $A^{n-1}$. We provide resolutions $Z.$ for $Sym_I(A)$, such that
$\det((Z.)_\nu)$ gives a multiple of the implicit equation, for a graded strand
$\nu\gg 0$. Precisely, we give specific bounds $\nu$ on all these settings
which depend on the regularity of $\SIA$. Starting from the homogeneous
structure of the Cox ring of a toric variety, graded by the divisor class group
of $T$, we give a general definition of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity for a
polynomial ring $R$ over a commutative ring $k$, graded by a finitely generated
abelian group $G$, in terms of the support of some local cohomology modules. As
in the standard case, for a $G$-graded $R$-module $M$ and an homogeneous ideal
$B$ of $R$, we relate the support of $H_B^i(M)$ with the support of
$Tor_j^R(M,k)$.

the underlying ecosystem functions. Here we present empirical and theoretical
evidence for a new macroecological pattern related to the distributions of
local species persistence times, defined as the timespans between local
colonizations and extinctions in a given geographic region. Empirical
distributions pertaining to two different taxa, breeding birds and herbaceous
plants, analyzed in a new framework that accounts for the finiteness of the
observational period, exhibit power-law scaling limited by a cut-off determined
by the rate of emergence of new species. In spite of the differences between
taxa and spatial scales of analysis, the scaling exponents are statistically
indistinguishable from each other and significantly different from those
predicted by existing models. We theoretically investigate how the scaling
features depend on the structure of the spatial interaction network and show
that the empirical scaling exponents are reproduced once a two-dimensional
isotropic texture is used, regardless of the details of the ecological
interactions. The framework developed here also allows to link the cut-off
timescale with the spatial scale of analysis, and the persistence-time
distribution to the species-area relationship. We conclude that the inherent
coherence obtained between spatial and temporal macroecological patterns points
at a seemingly general feature of the dynamical evolution of ecosystems.

eta of the winds. We use the code RAMSES with adaptive mesh refinement to study
the shock structure up to smaller values of eta, higher spatial resolution and
greater spatial scales than have been previously achieved. 2D and 3D
simulations, neglecting orbital motion, are compared to widely-used analytic
results and their applicability is discussed. In the adiabatic limit, velocity
shear at the contact discontinuity triggers the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
We quantify the amplitude of the resulting fluctuations and find that they can
be significant even with a modest initial shear. Using an isothermal equation
of state leads to the development of thin shell instabilities. The initial
evolution and growth rates enables us to formally identify the non-linear thin
shell instability (NTSI) close to the binary axis. Some analogue of the
transverse acceleration instability is present further away. The NTSI produces
large amplitude fluctuations and dominates the long-term behaviour. We point
out the computational cost of properly following these instabilities. Our study

are often discussed within the framework of the conformal Newtonian gauge,

In this paper we use the above gauge to explore possible cosmological
consequences of a running Newton's constant $ G (\Box) $, as suggested by the
nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point scenario arising from the quantum
field-theoretic treatment of Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant
term. Here we focus on the effects of a scale-dependent coupling on the
so-called gravitational slip functions $\eta = \psi / \phi -1 $, whose
classical general relativity value is zero. Starting from a set of manifestly
covariant but non-local effective field equations derived earlier, we compute
the leading corrections in the potentials $\phi$ and $\psi$ for a
nonrelativistic, pressureless fluid. After providing an estimate for the
quantity $\eta$, we then focus on a comparison with results obtained in a
previous paper on matter density perturbations in the synchronous gauge, which
gave an estimate for the growth index parameter $\gamma$, also in the presence
of a running $G$. Our results indicate that, in the present framework and for a
given $ G (\Box) $, the corrections tend to be significantly larger in
magnitude for the perturbation growth exponents than for the conformal
Newtonian gauge slip function.

problem well-studied only in the limiting case of dimer coverings of regular

orientation on the plane, to be of irregular shape, and to possess different
types of attractive interactions. Using extensive numerical simulations we show
that at large tile densities there is a phase transition from a fluid of
rhombus tiles to a solid packing with broken rotational symmetry. We observe
self-assembly of broken-symmetry phases, even at low densities, in the presence
of attractive tile-tile interactions. Depending on tile shape and interactions
the solid phase can be random, possessing critical orientational fluctuations,
or crystalline. Our results suggest strategies for controlling tiling order in
experiments involving `molecular rhombi'.

(anti-)correlations are not present in this population, and suggesting a non
globular cluster-like origin of this particular population. In the dwarf galaxy
hypothesis for the formation of omega Cen, this population might be the best
candidate for the field population of its putative parent galaxy, although some
of its properties appear contradictory. It has also been suggested that the
most metal-rich population in omega Cen is significantly enriched in helium. If
this is true, the traditional abundance analysis techniques, based on model
atmospheres with normal helium content, might lead to errors. We have computed
helium enhanced atmospheres for three stars in our sample and verified that the
abundance errors due to the use of non-enhanced atmospheres are negligible.
Additional, indirect support to the enhanced helium content of the SGB-a

This
length gives the size of a volume such that from outside it the inside
electrical charges, positive and negative, electrically screen each other.
Given the enormous electrical potential that would develop with no screening,
we conjecture that the size of the Universe R, as given by the speed of light c
and its age t, R \approx ct, cannot be very much lower than the Debye length.
It turns out that it is about 1/3 \lambdaD. Hence inside the volume of size ct
there is an otward electrical pressure due to the lack of complete electrical
screening of the charges. The Universe does not collapse under its own
gravitational attraction, and we present the possibility that this is due to
the effect of the repulsive forces of these electrical charges. May be there is
too some other mechanism. There is strong evidence today in support of the idea
that space is not only expanding but doing it in an accelerated way. We find a
large number, 5x1060 that converts Planck's unit of mass, length, time, charge
e and angular momentum \hbar, into the mass M, size ct, age t, total charge Q
and (possibly) angular momentum of the Universe in a scale like way. It defines

bounded, rotating contact binary affected by the tidal force acting from a
planet. Spin variations of such binaries were extensively studied during
planetary close encounters. Two main types of dynamical behaviour were
observed: (i) huge but interim fluctuations of the angular velocity and (ii)
permanent changes of a rotation during a close approach. The first type is
observed mainly for fast rotators, while the second one was encountered in a
population of slowly spinning objects with periods longer than 12 hours.
Conclusions on usability of such crude physical body models in dynamical
investigations and a comparison to previous results were attached. The results
allow us to formulate a thesis explaining the phenomenon of creation of the
extremely slow rotators and an observational excess of such type of objects.

key to overcoming these problems. However, these priors in general lead to
computationally intractable models. This paper addresses the problem of
discovering compact representations of higher order priors which allow
efficient inference. We propose a framework for solving this problem which uses
a recently proposed representation of higher order functions where they are
encoded as lower envelopes of linear functions. Maximum a Posterior inference
on our learned models reduces to minimizing a pairwise function of discrete

this is a primarily theoretical paper, we also demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of our framework on the problem of learning a shape prior for

shapes. We evaluate the approximation accuracy, discuss properties of the

topic that is being investigated extensively nowadays. Although recent
observations gave evidence of the dominance of Kinetic Alfv\'en Waves (KAW) at
sub-ion scales with $\omega<{\omega_{ci}}$, other studies suggest that the KAW
mode cannot carry the turbulence cascade down to electron scales and that the
whistler mode (i.e., $\omega>\omega_{ci}$) is more relevant. Here, we propose
to study key properties of the short wavelength plasma modes under realistic SW
conditions, typically $\beta_i\gtrsim \beta_e\sim 1$ and for high oblique
angles of propagation $80^\circ\leq \Theta_{\bf kB}<90^\circ$ as observed from
the Cluster data. The linear properties of the plasma modes under these
conditions are poorly known, which contrasts with the well-documented cold
plasma limit and/or moderate oblique angles of propagation ($\Theta_{\bf kB}
<80^\circ$). Based on linear solutions of the Vlasov kinetic theory, we discuss
the relevance of each plasma mode (fast, Bernstein, KAW, whistler) in carrying
the energy cascade down to electron scales. We show, in particular, that the
shear Alfv\'en mode extends at scales $k\rho_i\gtrsim1$ following either a
whistler mode ($\omega>\omega_{ci}$) or a KAW mode (with $\omega<\omega_{ci}$)
depending on the anisotropy $k_\parallel/ k_\perp$. This contrasts with the
well-accepted idea that the whistler branch develops as a continuation at high
frequencies of the fast magnetosonic mode. We show, furthermore, that the
whistler branch is more damped than the KAW one, which makes the latter a more
relevant candidate to carry the energy cascade down to electron scales. We
discuss how these new findings may facilitate resolution of the controversy
concerning the nature of the small scale turbulence, and we discuss the
implications for present and future spacecraft wave measurements in the SW.

Sharkas et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 064113 (2011)] is presented. It is based on
the explicit treatment of a fraction of multideterminantal exact exchange. The
connection with conventional double hybrids is made when neglecting density
scaling in the correlation functional as well as second-order corrections to
the density. In this context, the fraction ac of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset
(MP2) correlation energy is not necessarily equal to the square of the fraction
ax of Hartree-Fock exchange. More specifically, it is shown that ac \leq ax2, a
condition that conventional semi-empirical double hybrids actually fulfill. In
addition, a new procedure for calculating the orbitals, which has a better
justification than the one routinely used, is proposed. Referred to as
{\lambda}1 variant, the corresponding double hybrid approximation has been
tested on a small set consisting of H2, N2, Be2, Mg2, and Ar2. Three
conventional double hybrids (B2-PLYP, B2GP-PLYP, and PBE0-DH) have been
considered. Potential curves obtained with {\lambda}1- and regular double
hybrids can, in some cases, differ significantly. In particular, for the weakly
bound dimers, the {\lambda}1 variants bind systematically more than the regular
ones, which is an improvement in many but not all cases. Including density
scaling in the correlation functionals may of course change the results
significantly. Moreover, optimized effective potentials based on a
partially-interacting system could also be used to generate proper orbitals.
Work is currently in progress in those directions.

its vertices A, the protocol consists in: (i) encoding the quantum secret into
the corresponding graph state by acting on the qubits in A; (ii) use a
classical encoding to ensure the existence of a threshold. These new protocols
realize ((k,n)) quantum secret sharing i.e., any set of at least k players
among n can reconstruct the quantum secret, whereas any set of less than k
players has no information about the secret. In the particular case where the
secret is encoded on all the qubits, we explore the values of k for which there
exists a graph such that the corresponding protocol realizes a ((k,n)) secret
sharing. We show that for any threshold k> n-n^{0.68} there exists a graph
allowing a ((k,n)) protocol. On the other hand, we prove that for any k<
79n/156 there is no graph G allowing a ((k,n)) protocol. As a consequence there
exists n_0 such that the protocols introduced by Markham and Sanders admit no
threshold k when the secret is encoded on all the qubits and n>n_0.

development of opinion in a small population of agents by means of a
computational model of opinion formation in a co-evolving network of socially
linked agents. The personal and external factors are taken into account by
assigning an individual attitude parameter to each agent, and by subjecting all
to an external but homogeneous field to simulate the effect of the media. We
then adjust the field strength in the model by using actual data on scientific
perception surveys carried out in two different populations, which allow us to
compare two different societies. We interpret the model findings with the aid
of simple mean field calculations. Our results suggest that scientifically
sound concepts are more difficult to acquire than concepts not validated by

$\zeta^2=\sqrt[e]{1}$ and $\lambda$ was, initially, required to be $e$-regular.
Some additional restrictions on $e$ were required---e.g., $e>h$, the Coxeter

  Translation to a facet gave an explicit semisimple series for all quantum
Weyl modules with singular, as well as regular, weights. That is, the sections
of the filtration are explicit semisimple modules with computable
multiplicities of irreducible constituents. However, in the singular case, the
filtration conceivably might not be the radical filtration. This paper shows
how a similar semisimple series result can be obtained for all positive

gene therapy. In this review of modeling drug and gene delivery, we focus on
the particular stage of plasmid DNA or virus cytoplasmic trafficking. A
challenging problem is to quantify the success of this limiting stage. We
present some models and simulations of plasmid trafficking and of the limiting
phase of DNA-polycation escape from an endosome and discuss virus cytoplasmic
trafficking. The models can be used to assess the success of viral escape from
endosomes, to quantify the early step of viral-cell infection, and to propose
new simulation tools for designing new hybrid-viruses as synthetic vectors.

value of the energy-momentum tensor operator are investigated for a massive
scalar field with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter, subject to a
spherical boundary in the background of de Sitter spacetime. The field is
prepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state and is constrained to satisfy Robin
boundary conditions on the sphere. Both the interior and exterior regions are
considered. For the calculation in the interior region, a mode-summation method
is employed, supplemented with a variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula.
This allows us to explicitly extract the contributions to the expectation
values which come from de Sitter spacetime without boundaries. We show that the
vacuum energy-momentum tensor is non-diagonal with the off-diagonal component
corresponding to the energy flux along the radial direction. With dependence on
the boundary condition and the mass of the field, this flux can be either
positive or negative. Several limiting cases of interest are then studied. In
terms of the curvature coupling parameter and the mass of the field, two very
different regimes are realized, which exhibit monotonic and oscillatory
behavior of the vacuum expectation values, respectively, far from the sphere.
The decay of the boundary induced expectation values at large distances from
the sphere is shown to be power-law (monotonic or oscillating), independent of
the value of the field mass.

~0.5-0.7 M_sun, i.e., an evolution with optically thick winds like in usual
classical novae, or an another type of evolution without them like in the
symbiotic nova PU Vul. The latter type is characterized by spectra of no
indication of strong winds as well as a long-lasted flat optical peak in its
light curve. We propose a transition from no-optically-thick-wind evolution to
usual evolution with optically thick winds as a new outburst model for slow
novae that show a relatively long-lasted multipeak phase followed by a wind
phase like in the slow novae V723 Cas, HR Del, and V5558 Sgr. We calculated
nova envelopes with one-dimensional approximation of the companion's effects
and found that when the companion star is deeply embedded in the extended nova
envelope, the structure of static envelope approaches that of the optically
thick wind solution. Thus, the transition from static to wind solution is
triggered by the effect of the companion. The transition occurs in a close
binary nova like V723 Cas, but is not triggered in a long period binary like PU
Vul. We reconfirm our previous results that the frictional energy deposition is
negligibly small in almost all of hydrogen/helium novae because of the low
envelope density at the orbit.

light valence quarks on MILC $N_f = 2 +1$ lattices. Using methods developed
recently for HPQCD's study of $D \rightarrow K, l \nu$ decays, we find $f^{D

Combining the new result with CLEO-c branching fraction data, we extract the
CKM matrix element $|V_{cd}| = 0.225(6)_{exp.}(10)_{lat.}$, where the first
error comes from experiment and the second from theory. With a total error of
$\sim5.3$\% the accuracy of direct determination of $|V_{cd}|$ from $D$
semileptonic decays has become comparable to (and in good agreement with) that
from neutrino scattering. We also check for second row unitarity using this new
$|V_{cd}|$, HPQCD's earlier $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ from the Fermilab Lattice

nucleon resonances, both in experiment and in theory. The most accurate results
have been obtained for the electroexcitation amplitudes of the four lowest
excited states, which have been measured in a range of Q2 up to 8 and 4.5 GeV2
for the Delta(1232)P33, N(1535)S11 and N(1440)P11, N(1520)D13}, respectively.
These results have been confronted with calculations based on lattice QCD,
large-Nc relations, perturbative QCD (pQCD), and QCD-inspired models. The
amplitudes for the Delta(1232) indicate large pion-cloud contributions at low
Q2 and don't show any sign of approaching the pQCD regime for Q2<7 GeV2.
Measured for the first time, the electroexcitation amplitudes of the Roper
resonance, N(1440)P11, provide strong evidence for this state as a
predominantly radial excitation of a three-quark (3q) ground state, with
additional non-3-quark contributions needed to describe the low Q2 behavior of
the amplitudes. The longitudinal transition amplitude for the N(1535)S11 was
determined and has become a challenge for quark models. Explanations may
require large meson-cloud contributions or alternative representations of this
state. The N(1520)D13 clearly shows the rapid changeover from helicity-3/2
dominance at the real photon point to helicity-1/2 dominance at Q2 > 0.5 GeV2,
confirming a long-standing prediction of the constituent quark model. The
interpretation of the moments of resonance transition form factors in terms of
transition transverse charge distributions in infinite momentum frame is
presented.
