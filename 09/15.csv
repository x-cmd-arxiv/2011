into a set of self-consistent equations for electronic structure calculations
using the Gutzwiller approximation. The method is illustrated by the
application to a tight-binding model describing the strongly correlated
{\gamma}-Ce system. With the inclusion of the 5d-electrons into the local
Gutzwiller projection subspace, the correct input Coulomb repulsion U_{ff}
between the 4f-electrons for {\gamma}-Ce in the calculations can be pushed far
beyond the usual screened value U_{ff}^{scr} and close to the bare atomic value
U_{ff}^{bare}. This indicates that the d-f many-body screening is the dominant
contribution to the screening of U_{ff} in this system. The method provides a
promising way towards the ab initio Gutzwiller density functional theory.

the convex hull of a uniform sample from the interior of convex polygon was
derived.
  In the unpublished preprint Nagaev and Khamdamov (1991) (in Russian) a
central limit result for the joint distribution of the number of vertices and
the remaining area is given, using a coupling of the sample process near the
border of the polygon with a Poisson point process as in Groeneboom (1988), and
representing the remaining area in the Poisson approximation as a union of a
doubly infinite sequence of independent standard exponential random variables.
  We derive this representation from the representation in Groeneboom (1988)
and also prove the central limit result of Nagaev and Khamdamov (1991), using
this representation. The relation between the variances of the asymptotic
normal distributions of number of vertices and the area, established in Nagaev
and Khamdamov (1991), corresponds to a relation between the actual sample
variances of the number of vertices and the remaining area in Buchta (2005). We
show how these asymptotic results all follow from one simple guiding principle.
This corrects at the same time the scaling constants in Nagaev (1995) and Cabo

collisions at 7 TeV, resulting in billions of events and petabytes of data. At
these scales, physicists must have the capability to read only the data of
interest to their analyses, with the importance of efficient selective access
increasing as data taking continues. ATLAS has developed a sophisticated
event-level metadata infrastructure and supporting I/O framework allowing event
selections by explicit specification, by back navigation, and by selection
queries to a TAG database via an integrated web interface. These systems and
their performance have been reported on elsewhere. The ultimate success of such
a system, however, depends significantly upon the efficiency of selective event
retrieval. Supporting such retrieval can be challenging, as ATLAS stores its
event data in column-wise orientation using ROOT trees for a number of reasons,
including compression considerations, histogramming use cases, and more. For
2011 data, ATLAS will utilize new capabilities in ROOT to tune the persistent
storage layout of event data, and to significantly speed up selective event
reading. The new persistent layout strategy and its implications for I/O

random field and informational process' path functional (IPF), allows us
modeling the evolutionary information processes and revealing regularities of
evolution dynamics. Conventional Shannon's information measure evaluates a
sequence of the process' static events for each information state and do not
reveal hidden dynamic connections between these events. The paper formulates
the mathematical forms of the information regularities, based on a minimax
variation principle (VP) for IPF, applied to the evolution's both random
microprocesses and dynamic macroprocesses. The paper shows that the VP single
form of the mathematical law leads to the following evolutionary regularities:
-creation of the order from stochastics through the evolutionary macrodynamics,
described by a gradient of dynamic potential, evolutionary speed and the
evolutionary conditions of a fitness and diversity; -the evolutionary hierarchy
with growing information values and potential adaptation; -the adaptive
self-controls and a self-organization with a mechanism of copying to a genetic
code. This law and the regularities determine unified functional informational
mechanisms of evolution dynamics. By introducing both objective and subjective
information observers, we consider the observers' information acquisition,
interactive cognitive evolution dynamics, and neurodynamics, based on the
EF-IPF approach. An evolution improvement consists of the subjective observer s
ability to attract and encode information whose value progressively increases.
The specific properties of a common information structure of evolution
processes are identifiable for each particular object-organism by collecting a
behavioral data from these organisms.

the fate and behavior of natural and anthropogenic tracers. Among these
tracers, age is taken as an ideal tracer which can yield interesting diagnoses,
as for example the characterization of the mixing and renewal of water masses,
of the fate and mixing of contaminants, or the calibration of hydro-dispersive
parameters used by numerical models. Such diagnoses are of great interest in
atmospheric and ocean circulation sciences, as well in surface and subsurface
hydrology. The temporal evolution of groundwater age and its frequency
distributions can display important changes as flow regimes vary due to natural
change in climate and hydrologic conditions and/or human induced pressures on
the resource to satisfy the water demand. Steady-state age frequency
distributions can be modelled using standard numerical techniques, since the
general balance equation describing age transport under steady-state flow
conditions is exactly equivalent to a standard advection-dispersion equation.
The time-dependent problem is however described by an extended transport
operator that incorporates an additional coordinate for water age. The
consequence is that numerical solutions can hardly be achieved, especially for
real 3-D applications over large time periods of interest. A novel algorithm
for solving the age distribution problem under time-varying flow regimes is
presented and, for some specific configurations, extended to the problem of
generalized component exposure time. The algorithm combines the Laplace
Transform technique applied to the age (or exposure time) coordinate with
standard time-marching schemes. The method is validated and illustrated using
analytical and numerical solutions considering 1-D, 2-D and 3-D theoretical
groundwater flow domains.

volatile organic compounds (VOCs) near a point source contamination in the

biodegradation and source ageing. The mass transport is governed by Fick's law
for diffusion, and the equation for reactive transport of VOCs in the soil gas
phase was solved for different source geometries and for different boundary
conditions. Model results were compared to experimental data from a
one-dimensional laboratory column and a radial-symmetric field experiment, and
the comparison yielded a satisfying agreement. The model results clearly
illustrate the significant isotope fractionation by gas-phase diffusion under
transient state conditions. This leads to an initial depletion of heavy
isotopes with increasing distance from the source. The isotope evolution of the
source is governed by the combined effects of isotope fractionation due to
vaporization, diffusion and biodegradation. The net effect can lead to an
enrichment or depletion of the heavy isotope in the remaining organic phase
depending on the compound and element considered. Finally, the isotope
evolution of molecules migrating away from the source and undergoing
degradation is governed by a combined degradation and diffusion isotope effect.
This suggests that in the unsaturated zone, the interpretation of
biodegradation based on isotope data must always be based on a model combining
gas-phase diffusion and degradation.

expectancy characterizes the time that radionuclides will spend in the

computed throughout the host rock by solving the backward-in-time solute

until the formation of the first minihalo. We then follow the collapse of the
gas within the minihalo up to densities of n = 10^12 cm^-3, at which point we
replace the high-density particles with a sink particle to represent the
growing protostar. We model the effect of Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation emitted
by the protostar, and employ a ray-tracing scheme to follow the growth of the
surrounding H II region over the next 5000 yr. We find that a disk assembles
around the first protostar, and that radiative feedback will not prevent
further fragmentation of the disk to form multiple Pop III stars. Ionization of
neutral hydrogen and photodissociation of H_2 by LW radiation leads to heating
of the dense gas to several thousand Kelvin, and this warm region expands
outward at the gas sound speed. Once the extent of this warm region becomes
equivalent to the size of the disk, the disk mass declines while the accretion
rate onto the protostars is reduced by an order of magnitude. This occurs when
the largest sink has grown to ~ 20 M_sol while the second sink has grown to 7
M_sol, and we estimate the main sink will approach an asymptotic value of ~ 30
M_sol by the time it reaches the main sequence. Our simulation thus indicates
that the most likely outcome is a massive Pop III binary. However, we simulate
only one minihalo, and the statistical variation between minihaloes may be
substantial. If Pop III stars were typically unable to grow to more than a few
tens of solar masses, this would have important consequences for the occurence
of pair-instability supernovae in the early Universe as well as the Pop III
chemical signature in the oldest stars observable today.

reach the biosphere or compliance area. The methodologies are applied to a
hypothetical but realistic Canadian Shield crystalline rock environment, which
is considered to be one of the most geologically stable areas on Earth. In an
approximately 10\times10\times1.5 km3 hypothetical study area, up to 1000 major
and intermediate fracture zones are generated from surface lineament analyses
and subsurface surveys. In the study area, mean and probability density of
lifetime expectancy are analyzed with realistic geologic and hydrologic shield
settings in order to demonstrate the applicability of the theory and the
numerical model for optimally locating a deep subsurface repository for the
safe storage of spent nuclear fuel. The results demonstrate that, in general,
groundwater lifetime expectancy increases with depth and it is greatest inside
major matrix blocks. Various sources and aspects of uncertainty are considered,
specifically geometric and hydraulic parameters of permeable fracture zones.
Sensitivity analyses indicate that the existence and location of permeable
fracture zones and the relationship between fracture zone permeability and
depth from ground surface are the most significant factors for lifetime
expectancy distribution in such a crystalline rock environment. As a
consequence, it is successfully demonstrated that the concept of lifetime
expectancy can be applied to siting and performance assessment studies for deep
geologic repositories in crystalline fractured rock settings.

stochastic model for periodic sensor-deployment (in face of their limited

conventional continuous birth-death process, since new nodes are added to the

situations. We analyze the periodic node deployment process using discrete
birth-continuous death process and obtain two important statistical measures of
the existing number of nodes in the network, namely the mean and variance. We
show that the above mentioned sequences of mean and variances always converge
to finite steady state values, thus ensuring the stability of the system. We
also develop a cost function for the process of periodic deployment of sensor
nodes and minimize it to find the optimal time ({\tau}) and optimum number of

magnetic field and plasma in surrounding atmosphere i.e., electric currents are
aligned with the magnetic field, giving rise to zero Lorentz force. Computation
of various magnetic parameters such as magnetic energy, gradient of twist of
sunspot fields and any kind of extrapolations, heavily hinge on the force-free
approximation of the photospheric sunspot magnetic fields. Thus it is important
to inspect the force-freeness of sunspot fields. The force-freeness of sunspot
magnetic fields has been examined earlier by some researchers ending with
incoherent results. Accurate photospheric vector field measurements with high
spatial resolution are required to inspect the force-free nature of sunspots.
We use several such vector magnetograms obtained from the Solar Optical
Telescope/Spectro-Polarimeter aboard the Hinode. Both necessary and sufficient
conditions for force-freeness are examined by checking global and local nature
of magnetic forces over sunspots. We find that the sunspot magnetic fields are
not much away from force-free configuration, although they are not completely
force-free on the photosphere. The umbral and inner penumbral fields are more
force-free than the middle and the outer penumbral fields. During their
evolution, sunspot magnetic fields are found to maintain their proximity to
force-free behaviour. Although a dependence of net Lorentz force components is
seen on the evolutionary stages of the sunspots, we don't find a systematic
relationship between the nature of sunspot fields and associated flare
activity. Further, we examine whether the fields at photosphere follow linear
or non-linear force free conditions. After examining this in various complex
and simple sunspots we conclude that,in either case,the photospheric sunspot
fields are closer to satisfy non linear force-free field approximation.

rapidly rotating early B-type star HR 5907, based on observations obtained as
part of the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) project. We infer a rotation
period of 0.508276 +0.000015/-0.000012 d from photometric and H{\alpha} EW
measurements, making this the shortest period, non-degenerate, magnetic massive
star known to date. From the comparison of IUE UV and optical spectroscopy with
LTE BRUCE/KYLIE models we find a solid-angle integrated, uniform black-body
temperature of 17 000 \pm 1000 K, a projected rotational velocity of 290 \pm 10
km/s, an equatorial radius of 3.1 \pm 0.2 R_sun, a stellar mass of 5.5 \pm 0.5
M_sun, and an inclination angle of the rotation axis to our line-of-sight of 70
\pm 10\circ. Our measurements of the longitudinal magnetic field, which vary
between -500 and -2000 G, phase coherently with the rotation period and imply a
surface dipole field strength of \sim15.7 kG. On the other hand, from fits to
mean Least-Squares Deconvolved Stokes V line profiles we infer a dipole field
strength of \sim10.4 kG. This disagreement may result from a magnetic
configuration more complex than our model, and/or from the non-uniform helium
surface abundance distribution. In either case we obtain a magnetic obliquity
nearly aligned with the rotation axis ({\beta} = 7+2/-1\circ). Our optical
spectroscopy also shows weak variability in carbon, silicon and nitrogen lines.
The emission variability in hydrogen Balmer and Paschen lines indicates the
presence of a dense, highly structured magnetosphere, interpreted as a
centrifugally supported, magnetically confined circumstellar disk.

level of similarity between element attributes. While in reality relational
ties between elements can be expected to be based on similarity across multiple
attributes, the vast majority of work to date on association networks involves
ties defined with respect to only a single attribute. We propose an approach
for the inference of multi-attribute association networks from measurements on
continuous attribute variables, using canonical correlation and a
hypothesis-testing strategy. Within this context, we then study the impact of
partial information on multi-attribute network inference and characterization,
when only a subset of attributes is available. We consider in detail the case
of two attributes, wherein we examine through a combination of analytical and
numerical techniques the implications of the choice and number of node
attributes on the ability to detect network links and, more generally, to
estimate higher-level network summary statistics, such as node degree,

construct from these two surveys contains 20 non-magnetic systems. We carefully
include all sources of statistical error in calculating \rho and \Phi by using
Monte Carlo simulations; the most important uncertainty proves to be the often
large errors in distances estimates. If we assume that the 20 CVs in the

to account for biases in the measurement, we have to adopt a functional form
for \Phi. Assuming that the X-ray luminosity function of non-magnetic CVs is a
truncated power law, we constrain the power law index to -0.80 \pm 0.05. It
seems likely that the two surveys have failed to detect a large, faint
population of short-period CVs, and that the true space density may well be a
factor of 2 or 3 larger than what we have measured; this is possible, even if
we only allow for undetected CVs to have X-ray luminosities in the narrow range
28.7< log(L_X/erg\,s^{-1})<29.7. However, \rho as high as 2 \times 10^{-4}

identifying GRB 080207 as a dark burst. Swift X-ray observations show extreme
absorption in the host, which is confirmed by the unusually large optical
extinction found by modelling the X-ray to nIR afterglow spectral energy
distribution. Our Chandra observations obtained 8 days post-burst allow us to
place the afterglow on the sky to sub-arcsec accuracy, enabling us to pinpoint
an extremely red galaxy (ERO). Follow-up host observations with HST, Spitzer,
Gemini, Keck and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) provide a photometric
redshift solution of z ~1.74 (+0.05,-0.06) (1 sigma), 1.56 < z < 2.08 at 2
sigma) for the ERO host, and suggest that it is a massive and morphologically
disturbed ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) system, with L_FIR ~ 2.4 x
10^12 L_solar. These results add to the growing evidence that GRBs originating
in very red hosts always show some evidence of dust extinction in their
afterglows (though the converse is not true -- some extinguished afterglows are
found in blue hosts). This indicates that a poorly constrained fraction of GRBs
occur in very dusty environments. By comparing the inferred stellar masses, and
estimates of the gas phase metallicity in both GRB hosts and sub-mm galaxies we
suggest that many GRB hosts, even at z>2 are at lower metallicity than the
sub-mm galaxy population, offering a likely explanation for the dearth of
sub-mm detected GRB hosts. However, we also show that the dark GRB hosts are
systematically more massive than those hosting optically bright events, perhaps
implying that previous host samples are severely biased by the exclusion of
dark events.

Jupiter WASP-12b motivates the exotic new class of carbon-rich planets (CRPs).
We report a detailed study of the atmospheric chemistry and spectroscopic
signatures of carbon-rich giant planets (CRGs) and the compositions of icy
planetesimals required for their formation, and the apportionment of ices,
rock, and volatiles in their envelopes. For C/O >= 1, most of the atmospheric
oxygen is occupied by CO for T > 1400 K and pressure (P) < 1 bar, causing a
substantial depletion in H2O, and an overabundance of CH4 compared to those
obtained by assuming solar abundances (C/O = 0.54) in chemical equilibrium.
These differences in chemistry cause distinctly observable signatures in
spectra. We also find that a C/O >= 1 strongly depletes the abundances of TiO
and VO available to form thermal inversions, which is adequate to rule out
thermal inversions due to TiO/VO even in the most highly irradiated hot
Jupiters, such as WASP-12b. Adopting stellar abundances (C/O = 0.44) for the
primordial disk composition and low-temperature formation conditions (T <= 30
K) for WASP-12b leads to a C/O ratio of 0.27 in accreted planetesimals, and,
consequently, in the planet's envelope. In contrast, a C/O ratio of 1 in the
envelope of WASP-12b requires a substantial depletion of oxygen in the disk, by
a factor of ~0.41 for the same formation conditions. This scenario also
satisfies the constraints on the C/H and O/H ratios reported for WASP-12b. If,
alternatively, hotter conditions prevailed in a stellar composition disk such
that only H2O is condensed, the remaining gas can potentially have a C/O ~ 1.
However, a high C/O in WASP-12b caused predominantly by gas accretion would
preclude super-stellar C/H ratios which also fit the data.

families (i.e. orbits with commensurable frequencies). If a good estimate of
the Galactic potential in the inner halo (within ~50kpc) is available, the
appearance of strong, stable resonances in frequency maps of halo orbits will
allow us to determine the degree of resonant trapping induced by the disk
potential. The locations and strengths of these resonant families are
determined both by the global shape of the halo and its distribution function.
Identification of such resonances in the Milky Way's stellar halo would
therefore provide evidence of an extended period of adiabatic disk growth. If
the Galactic potential is not known exactly, a measure of the diffusion rate of
large sample of 10^4 halo orbits can help distinguish between the true
potential and an incorrect potential. The orbital spectral analysis methods
described in this paper provide a strong complementarity to existing methods
for constraining the potential of the Milky Way halo and its stellar
distribution function (ABRIDGED).

model which captures the main features of the ellipsoidal collapse of halos.
Contrary to previous results based on extensions of the Press-Schechter

halos directly alter the signature of primordial NG. This points toward a
potential degeneracy between the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity and that
of non-linear halo collapse. The inferred mass function is found to be in
remarkable agreement with N-body simulations of NG local type. Deviations are
well within numerical uncertainties for all values of -80 < fNL^loc < 300 in
the range of validity of the perturbative calculation. Moreover, the comparison
with simulation results suggests that for fNL > 150 or fNL < -50 the non-linear
collapse of halos, as described by our barrier model, strongly deviates from
that of Gaussian initial conditions. This is not surprising since the effect of
non-linear gravitational processes may be altered by initially large NG. Hence,
in the lack of prior theoretical knowledge, halo collapse model parameters
should be included in statistical halo mass function data analysis which aim to

flavor-changing $Z^\prime$ is of some interest as it naturally predicts a top
quark in the forward region of rapidity. To reproduce the size of the Tevatron
asymmetry, the couplings of the $Z^\prime$ to standard model quarks must be
large, inevitably leading to production of same-sign top quark pairs at the
Tevatron and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We discuss the constraints on
this model from (a) the Tevatron $t \bar{t}$ cross section, (b) the Tevatron $t

communications. However, efforts towards this goal face unacceptable
attenuation of light caused by surface roughness in microscopic devices. Here
we address this problem by introducing Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics
(SNAP). The SNAP platform is based on whispering gallery modes circulating
around the optical fiber surface and undergoing slow axial propagation readily
described by the one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation. These modes can be
steered with dramatically small nanoscale variation of the fiber radius, which
is quite simple to introduce in practice. The extremely low loss of SNAP
devices is achieved due to the fantastically low surface roughness inherent in
a drawn fiber surface. In excellent agreement with the developed theory, we
experimentally demonstrate localization of light in quantum wells, halting
light by a point source, tunneling through potential barriers, dark states,
etc. This demonstration, prototyping basic quantum mechanical phenomena with
light, has intriguing potential applications in filtering, switching, slowing
light, and sensing.

found no previously known clusters in a search radius region of several tens

critical issue for practice. When the Channel State Information (CSI) is
available at both the transmitter and the receiver, Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) is commonly applied for a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output

novel techniques, Perfect Coded Multiple Beamforming (PCMB) and Bit-Interleaved
Coded Multiple Beamforming with Perfect Coding (BICMB-PC), are proposed,
employing both PSTBCs and SVD with and without channel coding, respectively.
With CSI at the transmitter (CSIT), the decoding complexity of PCMB is
substantially reduced compared to a MIMO system employing PSTBC, providing a
new prospect of CSIT. Especially, because of the special property of the
generation matrices, PCMB provides much lower decoding complexity than the
state-of-the-art SVD-based uncoded technique in dimensions 2 and 4. Similarly,
the decoding complexity of BICMB-PC is much lower than the state-of-the-art
SVD-based coded technique in these two dimensions, and the complexity gain is
greater than the uncoded case. Moreover, these aforementioned complexity
reductions are achieved with only negligible or modest loss in performance.

Rev. Lett. 105, 063001 (2010)], an extensive review is given of the
demonstration that the resulting spectrum at 51 nm is fully phase coherent and
can be applied to precision metrology. The pulses are used in a scheme of
direct-frequency-comb excitation of helium atoms from the ground state to the
1s4p and 1s5p 1P_1 states. Laser ionization by auxiliary 1064 nm pulses is used
to detect the excited state population, resulting in a cosine-like signal as a
function of the repetition rate of the frequency comb with a modulation
contrast of up to 55%. Analysis of the visibility of this comb structure yields
an estimated timing jitter between the two upconverted comb laser pulses of 50
attoseconds, whch indicates that extension to even shorter wavelengths should
be feasible. The helium metrology investigation results in transition
frequencies of 5740806993(10) MHz and 5814248672(6) MHz for excitation of the
1s4p and 1s5p 1P_1 states, respectively. This constitutes the first absolute
frequency measurement in the XUV, attaining unprecedented accuracy in this

frequencies an eight-fold improved 4He ionization energy of 5945204212(6) MHz

41247(6) MHz. This experimental value is in agreement with recent theoretical
calculations up to order m\alpha^6 and m^2/(M\alpha^5), but with a six times

an associated secondary constraint, eliminates the ghost. This result

electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials dissolved in a volatile solvent.
After some form of coating onto a substrate, the solvent evaporates. An
initially homogeneous mixture separates into electron-acceptor rich and
electron-donor rich regions as the solvent evaporates. Depending on the
specifics of the blend and processing conditions different morphologies are
typically formed. Experimental evidence consistently confirms that the
morphology critically affects device performance. A computational framework
that can predict morphology evolution can significantly augment experimental
analysis. Such a framework will also allow high throughput analysis of the
large phase space of processing parameters, thus yielding insight into the
process-structure-property relationships.
  In this paper, we formulate a computational framework to predict evolution of
morphology during solvent-based fabrication of organic thin films. This is
accomplished by developing a phase field-based model of evaporation-induced and
substrate-induced phase-separation in ternary systems. This formulation allows
all the important physical phenomena affecting morphology evolution during
fabrication to be naturally incorporated. We discuss the various numerical and
computational challenges associated with a three dimensional, finite-element
based, massively parallel implementation of this framework. This formulation
allows, for the first time, to model 3D morphology evolution over large time
spans on device scale domains. We illustrate this framework by investigating
and quantifying the effect of various process and system variables on
morphology evolution. We explore ways to control the morphology evolution by
investigating different evaporation rates, blend ratios and interaction
parameters between components.

real vectors where some of the data are missing. This problem contains
regression and mapping inversion as particular cases where the pattern of
missing data is independent of the sequence index. The problem is hard because
it involves possibly multivalued mappings at each vector in the sequence, where
the missing variables can take more than one value given the present variables;
and the set of missing variables can vary from one vector to the next. To solve
this problem, we propose an algorithm based on two redundancy assumptions:
vector redundancy (the data live in a low-dimensional manifold), so that the
present variables constrain the missing ones; and sequence redundancy (e.g.
continuity), so that consecutive vectors constrain each other. We capture the
low-dimensional nature of the data in a probabilistic way with a joint density
model, here the generative topographic mapping, which results in a Gaussian
mixture. Candidate reconstructions at each vector are obtained as all the modes
of the conditional distribution of missing variables given present variables.
The reconstructed sequence is obtained by minimising a global constraint, here
the sequence length, by dynamic programming. We present experimental results
for a toy problem and for inverse kinematics of a robot arm.

allows for the correlated nature of the noise. We give an example application

non-terminating queries for definite logic programs. Although these
non-termination analyzers have shown to be rather precise, their applicability
on real-life Prolog programs is limited because most Prolog programs use
non-logical features. As a first step towards the analysis of Prolog programs,
this paper presents a non-termination condition for Logic Programs containing
integer arithmetics. The analyzer is based on our non-termination analyzer
presented at ICLP 2009. The analysis starts from a class of queries and infers
a subclass of non-terminating ones. In a first phase, we ignore the outcome
(success or failure) of the arithmetic operations, assuming success of all
arithmetic calls. In a second phase, we characterize successful arithmetic
calls as a constraint problem, the solution of which determines the
non-terminating queries.

first construct a microscopic classical Heisenberg model for RMnO3 including
the frustrated spin exchanges, single-ion anisotropy, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

Mn spins via the Peierls-type magnetostriction. By analyzing this model using
the replica-exchange Monte-Carlo technique, we reproduce the entire phase
diagram of RMnO3 in the plane of temperature and magnitude of the orthorhombic

phase, the (S.S)-type magnetostriction plays an important role for the
ferroelectric order with polarization P//a whose contribution is comparable to
or larger than the contribution from the (SxS)-type magnetostriction, whereas
in the bc-plane spiral phase, the ferroelectric order with P//c is purely of
(SxS) origin. This explains much larger P in the ab-plane spiral phase than the
bc-plane spiral phase as observed experimentally, and gives a clue how to
enhance the magnetoelectric coupling in the spin-spiral-based multiferroics. We
also predict a noncollinear deformation of the E-type spin structure resulting
in the finite (SxS) contribution to the ferroelectric order with P//a, and a
wide coexisting regime of the commensurate E and incommensurate spiral states,
which resolve several experimental puzzles.

particles and of the local hydrodynamics. Due to its high degree of locality,
the lattice Boltzmann method, when combined with a molecular dynamics solver
and parallelized on modern supercomputers, provides a tool that allows such
studies. Still, running simulations on hundreds of thousands of cores is not
trivial. We report on our practical experiences when employing large fractions
of an IBM Blue Gene/P system for our simulations. Then, we extend our model for
spherical particles in multicomponent flows to anisotropic ellipsoidal objects
rendering the shape of e.g. clay particles. The model is applied to a number of
test cases including the adsorption of single particles at fluid interfaces and
the formation and stabilization of Pickering emulsions or bijels.

While we do not prove this inequality in full generality, it is straightforward
to show that our conjecture holds in the subset of theories that do not have
accidental symmetries. In addition, we subject our inequality to an array of
non-trivial tests in theories with accidental symmetries and dramatically
different dynamics both in N=1 and N=2 supersymmetry and find that our
inequality is obeyed. One interesting consequence of this conjecture is that
the mixing of accidental symmetries with the IR superconformal R current is
bounded by the UV quantity, \tau_U^{UV}. To demonstrate the potential utility
of this bound, we apply it to the somewhat mysterious SU(2) gauge theory of
Intriligator, Seiberg, and Shenker and show that our conjecture, if correct,
implies that this theory flows in the IR to an interacting superconformal field

apply magnetospheric accretion (MA) shock modelling to reproduce the observed

  The median mass accretion rate is 2 x 10^-7 Msun yr^-1 in our sample. The
model fails to reproduce the large Balmer excesses shown by the four hottest
stars (T* > 12000 K). We derive Macc propto M*^5 and Lacc propto L*^1.2 for our
sample, with scatter. Empirical calibrations relating the accretion and the
Halpha, [OI]6300, and Brgamma luminosities are provided. The slopes in our
expressions are slightly shallower than those for lower mass stars, but the
difference is within the uncertainties, except for the [OI]6300 line. The
Halpha 10% width is uncorrelated with Macc, unlike for the lower mass regime.
The mean Halpha width shows higher values as the projected rotational
velocities of HAe stars increase, which agrees with MA. The accretion rate
variations in the sample are typically lower than 0.5 dex on timescales of days
to months, Our data suggest that the changes in the Balmer excess are
uncorrelated to the simultaneous changes of the line luminosities.
  The Balmer excesses and Halpha line widths of HAe stars can be interpreted
within the context of MA, which is not the case for several HBes. The steep
trend relating Macc and M* can be explained from the mass-age distribution
characterizing HAeBe stars. The line luminosities used for low-mass objects are
also valid to estimate typical accretion rates for the intermediate-mass regime
under similar empirical expressions. However, we suggest that several of these
calibrations are driven by the stellar luminosity.

collective and (long-time) translational self-diffusion coefficients, and the
rotational diffusion coefficient, have been measured as functions of the
platelet volume fraction \phi, up to the isotropic-liquid crystal (I/LC)
transition. The non-depolarized intensity autocorrelation function, measured at
low scattering wavenumbers, consists of a fast and a slowly decaying mode which
we interpret as the orientationally averaged collective and translational
self-diffusion coefficients, respectively. Both the rotational and the
long-time self-diffusion coefficients decrease very strongly, by more than two
orders of magnitude, in going from the very dilute limit to the I/LC transition
concentration. A similarly strong decrease, with increasing \phi, is observed
for the inverse zero-strain limiting static shear viscosity. With increasing
\phi, increasingly strong shear-thinning is observed, accompanied by a
shrinking of the low shear-rate Newtonian plateau. The measured diffusion
coefficients are interpreted theoretically in terms of a simple model of
effective charged spheres interacting by a screened Coulomb potential, with
hydrodynamic interactions included. The disk-like particle shape, and the
measured particle radius and thickness polydispersities, enter into the model
calculations via the scattering amplitudes. The interaction-induced enhancement
of the collective diffusion coefficient by more than a factor of 20 at larger

curves of 8 binary lensing events detected through the channel of
high-magnification events during the seasons from 2007 to 2010. The
perturbations, which are confined near the peak of the light curves, can be
easily distinguished from the central perturbations caused by planets. However,
the degeneracy between close and wide binary solutions cannot be resolved with
a $3\sigma$ confidence level for 3 events, implying that the degeneracy would
be an important obstacle in studying binary distributions. The dependence of
the degeneracy on the lensing parameters is consistent with a theoretic
prediction that the degeneracy becomes severe as the binary separation and the
mass ratio deviate from the values of resonant caustics. The measured mass

Observations at different wavelengths reveal a complex and dynamically very
active cluster, whose core is connected to a large scale filament extended over
several Mpc. Using multi-passband imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we identify 15 multiply imaged
systems across the full field of view of ACS, five of which we confirmed
spectroscopically in groundbased follow-up observations with the Keck
telescope. We use these multiply imaged systems to constrain a parametric model
of the mass distribution in the cluster core, employing a new parallelized
version of the Lenstool software. The main result is that the most probable
description of the mass distribution comprises four cluster-scale dark matter
haloes. The total mass distribution follows the light distribution but strongly
deviates from the distribution of the intra-cluster gas as traced by the X-ray
surface brightness. This confirms the complex morphology proposed by previous
studies. We interpret this segregation of collisional and collisionless matter
as strong evidence of multiple mergers and ongoing dynamical activity. MACS
J0717 thus constitutes one of the most disturbed clusters presently known and,
featuring a projected mass within the ACS field of view (R=150""=960 kpc) of
2.11 +- 0.23 x 10^{15} M_{sun}, the system is also one of the most massive

NLR, often reaching up to several times solar in their broad-line regions.
Low-metallicity AGN are rare objects which have so far always been associated
with low-mass galaxies hosting low-mass BHs (M_BH<10^6Msun). In this paper we
present IFS data of the low-redshift QSO HE 2158-0107 for which we find strong
evidence for sub-solar NLR metallicities associated with a massive BH
(M_BH~3x10^8Msun). The QSO is surrounded by a large extended emission-line
region reaching out to 30kpc from the QSO in a tail-like geometry. We present
optical and near-IR images and investigate the properties of the host galaxy.
The SED of the host is rather blue, indicative of a significant young age
stellar population formed within the last 1Gyr. A 3sigma upper limit of
L_bulge<4.5x10^10Lsun for the H band luminosity and a corresponding stellar
mass upper limit of M_bulge<3.4x10^10Msun show that the host is offset from the
local BH-bulge relations. This is independently supported by the kinematics of
the gas. Although the stellar mass of the host galaxy is lower than expected,
it cannot explain the exceptionally low metallicity of the gas. We suggest that
the extended emission-line region and the galaxy growth are caused by the
infall of nearly pristine gas from the environment of the QSO host. Minor
mergers of dwarf galaxies or the theoretically predicted smooth accretion of
cold gas are both potential drivers behind that process. Since the metallicity
of the gas in the NLR is much lower than expected, we suspect that the external
gas has already reached the galaxy centre and may even contribute to the
current feeding of the BH. HE 2158-0107 appears to represent a particular phase
of substantial BH and galaxy growth that can be observationally linked with the
accretion of external material from its environment.

core-halo structures in binary systems. Examples are provided by Thorne-Zytkov
objects, hot Jupiters, protoplanets with large moons, red supergiants in
binaries and globular clusters with central black hole. Instability criteria
due to resonance between internal and orbital frequencies in such a systems has
been derived. To achieve assumed goals, generalized planar circular restricted
three body problem is investigated with one of the point masses, $M$, replaced
with spherical body of finite size. Mechanical system under consideration
includes two large masses $m$ and $M$ and the test body with small mass $\mu$.
Only gravitational interactions are considered. Equations of motion are
presented, and linear instability criteria are derived using quantifier
elimination.
  Motion of the test mass $\mu$ is shown to be unstable due to resonance
between orbital and internal frequencies if $\frac{M}{d^3} < \frac{4}{3} \pi
\rho < \frac{ M + 3 m \left( 1+\mu/M \right)^{-1}}{d^3}$, where $\rho$ is the
central density of mass $M$, and $d$ distance between masses $m$ and $M$
(circular orbit diameter).
  The above result is important for core-collapse supernova theory, with mass
$\mu$ identified with helium core of the exploding massive star. The
instability cause off-center supernova ""ignition"" relative to the
center-of-mass of the hydrogen envelope. The instability is also inevitable
during protoplanet growth, with hypothetical ejection of the rocky core from
gas giants and formation of the ""puffy planets"" due to resonance with orbital
frequency. Hypothetical central intermediate black holes of the globular
clusters are also in unstable position with respect to perturbations caused by
the Galaxy.

that these filaments have very strong emission lines of molecular hydrogen and
carbon monoxide. The mass of molecular material is quite large, the gas is
quite warm, and the filaments have not formed stars despite their ~Gyr age. I
will discuss the general astrophysical context of large clusters of galaxies
and how large masses of molecular gas can be heated to produce what we observe.
  The unique properties of the filaments are a result of the unique
environment. Magnetically confined molecular filaments are surrounded by the
hot intra-cluster medium. Thermal particles with keV energies enter atomic and
molecular regions and produce a shower of secondary nonthermal electrons. These
secondaries collisionally heat, excite, dissociate, and ionize the cool gas.
While ionization is dominated by these secondary particles, recombination is
controlled by charge exchange, which produces the unusual optical emission line
spectrum. I will describe some of the physical processes that are unique to

are binarized and segmented into lines and characters. Characters are passed
into the recognition module. Experimenting with a set of 100 business card

such as content recommendation. In the present paper we investigate the
feasibility of user profiling in a distributed setting, with no central
authority and only local information exchanges between users. We compute a
profile vector for each user (i.e., a low-dimensional vector that characterises
her taste) via spectral transformation of observed user-produced ratings for
items. Our two main contributions follow: i) We consider a low-rank
probabilistic model of user taste. More specifically, we consider that users
and items are partitioned in a constant number of classes, such that users and
items within the same class are statistically identical. We prove that without
prior knowledge of the compositions of the classes, based solely on few random
observed ratings (namely $O(N\log N)$ such ratings for $N$ users), we can
predict user preference with high probability for unrated items by running a
local vote among users with similar profile vectors. In addition, we provide
empirical evaluations characterising the way in which spectral profiling
performance depends on the dimension of the profile space. Such evaluations are
performed on a data set of real user ratings provided by Netflix. ii) We
develop distributed algorithms which provably achieve an embedding of users
into a low-dimensional space, based on spectral transformation. These involve
simple message passing among users, and provably converge to the desired
embedding. Our method essentially relies on a novel combination of gossiping
and the algorithm proposed by Oja and Karhunen.

a scenario in which flares originated in the immediate vicinity of the
supermassive black hole are thermally reprocessed in a standard accretion disk
at about 10-20 Schwarzschild radii from the central dark object. We also report
that the light curve for the X-ray emission with power-law spectrum is delayed
with respect to those in the Ugr bands by about 32 days. Hence, the central
driving source can not be a standard corona emitting the observed power-law
X-rays. This result is also supported by X-ray reprocessing simulations and the
absence of X-ray reflection features in the spectrum of 0957+561. We plausibly

corresponding to scattering resonances, we find the microlocal limit of
resonant states with energies away from the real line. This statement is
similar to quantum unique ergodicity (QUE), which holds in certain other
situations; however, the proof uses only the structure of the infinite ends,
not the global properties of the geodesic flow. As an application, we also show
that the scattering matrix tends to zero in strips separated from the real
line.

moduli spaces of compact SLs in Calabi-Yau manifolds.
  In particular, our theorems yield the first examples of smooth SL conifolds
with 3 or more planar ends and the first (non-trivial) examples of SL conifolds
which have a conical singularity but are not, globally, cones. We also obtain:
(i) a desingularization procedure for transverse intersection and
self-intersection points, using ""Lawlor necks""; (ii) a construction which
completely desingularizes any SL conifold by replacing isolated conical
singularities with non-compact asymptotically conical (AC) ends; (iii) a proof
that there is no upper bound on the number of AC ends of a SL conifold; (iv)
the possibility of replacing a given collection of conical singularities with a
completely different collection of conical singularities and of AC ends.
  As a corollary of (i) we improve a result by Arezzo and Pacard concerning
minimal desingularizations of certain configurations of SL planes in C^m,
intersecting transversally.

TVLM 513-46546 and 2MASS J0036+1821104 using the Very Large Array (VLA) in June
2007. Ultracool dwarfs are expected to be undetectable at radio frequencies,
yet observations at 8.5 GHz (3.5 cm) and 4.9 GHz (6 cm) of have revealed
sources with > 100 {\mu}Jy quiescent radio flux and > 1 mJy pulses coincident
with stellar rotation. The anomalous emission is likely a combination of
gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser processes in a long-duration, large-scale
magnetic field. Since the characteristic frequency for each process scales
directly with the magnetic field magnitude, emission at lower frequencies may
be detectable from regions with weaker field strength. We detect no significant
radio emission at 325 MHz from TVLM 513-46546 or 2MASS J0036+1821104 over
multiple stellar rotations, establishing 2.5{\sigma} total flux limits of 795
{\mu}Jy and 942 {\mu}Jy respectively. Analysis of an archival VLA 1.4 GHz
observation of 2MASS J0036+1821104 from January 2005 also yields a
non-detection at the level of < 130 {\mu}Jy . The combined radio observation
history (0.3 GHz to 8.5 GHz) for these sources suggests a continuum emission
spectrum for ultracool dwarfs which is either flat or inverted below 2-3 GHz.
Further, if the cyclotron maser instability is responsible for the pulsed radio
emission observed on some ultracool dwarfs, our low-frequency non-detections
suggest that the active region responsible for the high-frequency bursts is
confined within 2 stellar radii and driven by electron beams with energies less
than 5 keV.

Also in this case the sign of the total pressure may reverse but only for

the Hartmann number of the magnetic field. For microscopic (i.e. small)

and Rhea) and Saturn's rings is debated. Charnoz et al. (2010) introduced the
idea that the smallest inner moons could form from the spreading of the rings'
edge while Salmon et al. (2010) showed that the rings could have been initially
massive, and so was the ring's progenitor itself. One may wonder if the
mid-sized moons may have formed also from the debris of a massive ring
progenitor, as also suggested in Canup (2010). However, the process driving
mid-sized moons accretion from the icy debris disks has not been investigated
in details. In particular, this process does not seem able to explain the
varying silicate contents of the mid-sized moons (from 6% to 57% in mass).
Here, we explore the formation of large objects from a massive ice-rich ring (a
few times Rhea's mass) and describe the fundamental properties and implications
of this new process. Using a hybrid computer model, we show that accretion
within massive icy rings can form all mid-sized moons from Mimas to Rhea.
However in order to explain their current locations, intense dissipation within
Saturn (with Qp<2000) would be required. Our results are consistent with a
satellite origin tied to the rings formation at least 2.5 Gy ago, both
compatible with either a formation concurrent to Saturn or during the Late
Heavy Bombardment. Tidal heating related to high-eccentricity post-accretional
episodes may induce early geological activity. If some massive irregular chunks
of silicates were initially present within the rings, they would be present
today inside the satellites' cores which would have accreted icy shells while
being tidally expelled from the rings (via a heterogeneous accretion
process)while those still present in the rings are interpreted as today
Saturn's rings' propellers and ring-moons (like Pan or Daphnis).

propose some gedanken experiments that could lead to the violation of the weak

small energy charged particles by the black hole. As for the case of scattering
in Kerr spacetimes, our results demonstrate explicitly that scalar fields are
subject to (electrical) superradiance phenomenon, while spin-1/2 fields are
not. Superradiance impose some limitations on the gedanken experiments
involving spin-0 fields, favoring, in this way, the mechanisms for creation of
a naked singularity by the quantum tunneling of spin-1/2 charged fermions. We
also discuss the implications that vacuum polarization effects and quantum
statistics might have on these gedanken experiments. In particular, we show
that they are not enough to prevent the absorption of incident small energy

partition function as well as the elliptic genus is then expanded by the
modular completions of irreducible discrete characters, which are parameterized

such a background, and integrate them up to an intermediate radial distance,
yielding an equivalent low energy dual field theory. The new ingredient,
compared to scalars, involves a `generalized' basis of coherent states which
labels a particular half of the fermion components as coordinates or momenta,
depending on the choice of quantization (standard or alternative). We apply
this technology to explicitly compute RG flows of charged fermionic operators
and their composites (double trace operators) in field theories dual to (a)
pure AdS and (b) extremal charged black hole geometries. The flow diagrams and
fixed points are determined explicitly. In the case of the extremal black hole,
the RG flows connect two fixed points at the UV AdS boundary to two fixed
points at the IR AdS_2 region. The double trace flow is shown, both numerically
and analytically, to develop a pole singularity in the AdS_2 region at low
frequency and near the Fermi momentum, which can be traced to the appearance of
massless fermion modes on the low energy cut-off surface. The low energy field
theory action we derive exactly agrees with the semi-holographic action
proposed by Faulkner and Polchinski in arXiv:1001.5049 [hep-th]. In terms of
field theory, the holographic version of Wilsonian RG leads to a quantum theory
with random sources. In the extremal black hole background the random sources
become `light' in the AdS_2 region near the Fermi surface and emerge as new

shells reported here are spread throughout most of the Perseus cloud and have
circular or arc-like morphologies with a range in radius of about 0.1 to 3 pc.
Most of them have not been detected before most likely as maps of the region
lacked the coverage and resolution needed to distinguish them. The majority of
the shells are coincident with infrared nebulosity of similar shape and have a
candidate powering source near the center. We suggest they are formed by the
interaction of spherical or very wide-angle winds powered by young stars inside
or near the Perseus molecular cloud -a cloud that is commonly considered to be
mostly forming low-mass stars. Two of the twelve shells are powered by
high-mass stars close to the cloud, while the others appear to be powered by
low or intermediate mass stars in the cloud. We argue that winds with a mass
loss rate of about 10^-8 to 10^-6 M_sun/yr are required to produce the observed
shells. Our estimates indicate that the energy input rate from these stellar
winds is similar to the turbulence dissipation rate. We conclude that in
Perseus the total energy input from both collimated protostellar outflows and
powerful spherical winds from young stars is sufficient to maintain the
turbulence in the molecular cloud. Large scale molecular line and IR continuum
maps of a sample of clouds will help determine the frequency of this phenomenon
in other star forming regions.

processes in an asynchronous distributed system to achieve consensus on a
binary value when a single process can fail; it is a widely cited theoretical
result about network computing. All proofs that I know depend essentially on
classical (nonconstructive) logic, although they use the hypothetical
construction of a nonterminating execution as a main lemma.
  FLP is also a guide for protocol designers, and in that role there is a
connection to an important property of consensus procedures, namely that they
should not block, i.e. reach a global state in which no process can decide.
  A deterministic fault-tolerant consensus protocol is effectively nonblocking
if from any reachable global state we can find an execution path that decides.
In this article we effectively construct a nonterminating execution of any such
protocol. That is, given any effectively nonblocking protocol P and a natural
number n, we show how to compute the n-th step of an infinitely indecisive
computation of P. From this fully constructive result, the classical FLP
follows as a corollary as well as a stronger classical result, called here
Strong FLP. Moreover, the construction focuses attention on the important role
of nonblocking in protocol design.
  An interesting consequence of the constructive proof is that we can, in
principle, build an undefeatable attacker for a consensus protocol that is
provably correct, indeed because it is provably correct. We can do this in
practice on certain kinds of networks.

three dimensional numerical simulations of the confinement which show that the
presence of the AlGaN shell has to be considered to explain the observed
dependence of the emission energy on the Al concentration in the barrier. The
simulations reveal that the maximum in the emission energy for x ~ 30% is
assigned to the smallest lateral strain gradient and consequently the lowest
radial internal electric fields in the nanodiscs. Higher Al-concentrations in
the barrier cause high radial electric fields that can overcome the exciton
binding energy and result in substantially reduced emission intensities.
Effects of polarization-induced axial internal electric fields on the
