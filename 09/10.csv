heavy-ion collisions, the photon transverse momentum can be used to gauge the
initial energy of the massive parton which is expected to propagate through the
dense QCD medium produced in those collisions. The two-particle final state
provides a range of observables (jet asymmetry, photon-jet pair momentum, among

modulation of photospheric spots on one of the binary components. This paper
presents the discovery and characterization of the object, including radial
velocities sufficient to determine both component masses to better than 1%

with radii larger than 10 Mpc/h up to redshift 0.12. Disk galaxies in shells
around these voids have been used to look for particular alignments between the

weight is a crude summary of other placental characteristics, such as the size
and shape of the chorionic plate and the location of the umbilical cord
insertion. Distributions of such measures across a cohort reveal information
about the developmental history of the chorionic plate that is unavailable from
an analysis based solely on the mean and standard deviation. Various measures
were determined from digitized images of chorionic plates obtained from the
Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Study, a prospective cohort study of
preterm birth in central North Carolina between 2002 and 2004. The centroids
(the geometric centers) and umbilical cord insertions were taken directly from
the images. The chorionic plate outlines were obtained from an interpolation
based on a Fourier series, while eccentricity (of the best-fit ellipse),
skewness, and kurtosis were determined from a shape analysis using the method
of moments. The distribution of each variable was compared against the normal,
lognormal, and Levy distributions. We found only a single measure
(eccentricity) with a normal distribution. All other placental measures
required lognormal or ""heavy-tailed"" distributions to account for moderate to
extreme deviations from the mean, where relative likelihoods in the cohort far
exceeded those of a normal distribution. Normal and lognormal distributions
result from the accumulated effects of a large number of independent additive
(normal) or multiplicative (lognormal) events. Thus, while most placentas
appear to develop by a series of small, regular, and independent steps, the
presence of heavy-tailed distributions suggests that many show shape features
which are more consistent with a large number of correlated steps or fewer, but
substantially larger, independent steps.

low-mass X-ray binary can be modelled to infer the disc inner edge radius. A
small value of this radius tentatively implies that the disc terminates either
at the neutron star hard surface, or at the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO). Therefore an inferred disc inner edge radius either provides the
stellar radius, or can directly constrain stellar equation of state (EoS)
models using the theoretically computed ISCO radius for the spacetime of a
rapidly spinning neutron star. However, this procedure requires numerical
computation of stellar and ISCO radii for various EoS models and neutron star
configurations using an appropriate rapidly spinning stellar spacetime. We have
fully general relativistically calculated about 16000 stable neutron star
structures to explore and establish the above mentioned procedure, and to show
that the Kerr spacetime is inadequate for this purpose. Our work systematically
studies the methods to constrain EoS models using relativistic disc lines, and
will motivate future X-ray astronomy instruments.

for a sample of 51 unobscured Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). All of these
AGNs have high quality spectra from both XMM-Newton and Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). We extend the wavelength coverage where possible by adding
simultaneous UV data from the OM onboard XMM-Newton. Our sample is selected
based on low reddening in the optical and low gas columns implied by their
X-ray spectra. They also lack clear signatures for the presence of a warm
absorber. Therefore the observed characteristics of this sample are likely to
be directly related to the intrinsic properties of the central engine.
  We perform multi-component spectral fitting for strong optical emission lines
and the whole optical spectra. We fit the combined optical, UV and X-ray data
by applying a new broadband SED model which comprises the accretion disc
emission, low temperature optically thick Comptonisation and a hard X-ray tail
by introducing the a corona radius (Done et al. 2011). We find that in order to
fit the data, the model often requires an additional long wavelength optical
continuum component, whose origin is discussed in this paper. We also find that
the Photo-recombination edge of Balmer continuum shifts and broadens beyond the
standard limit of 3646{\AA}, implying an electron number density which is far
higher than that in the broad line region clouds.
  Our results indicate that the Narrow Line Seyfert 1s in this sample tend to
have lower black hole masses, higher Eddington ratios, softer 2-10 keV band
spectra, lower 2-10 keV luminosities and higher \alpha_{ox}, compared with
typical broad line Seyfert 1s (BLS1), although their bolometric luminosities
are similar. We illustrate these differences in properties by forming an
average SED for three subsamples, based on the FWHM velocity width of the
H{\beta} emission line.

relatively high reheating temperature and we still need some amount of tuning

paradigm whose focus is about improving modularity, with an emphasis on the
modularization of crosscutting concerns.
  Objective: The goal of this paper is to assess the extent to which an AOP
language -ObjectTeams/Java (OT/J) -improves the modularity of a software
system. This improvement has been claimed but, to the best of our knowledge,
this paper is the first attempting to present quantitative evidence of it.
  Method: We compare functionally-equivalent implementations of the
Gang-of-Four design patterns, developed in Java and OT/J, using software
metrics.
  Results: The results of our comparison support the modularity improvement
claims made in the literature. For six of the seven metrics used, the OT/J
versions of the patterns obtained significantly better results.
  Limitations: This work uses a set of metrics originally defined for
object-oriented (OO) systems. It may be the case that the metrics are biased,
in that they were created in the context of OO programming (OOP), before the
advent of AOP. We consider this comparison a stepping stone as, ultimately, we
plan to assess the modularity improvements with paradigm independent metrics,
which will conceivably eliminate the bias. Each individual example from the
sample used in this paper is small. In future, we plan to replicate this
experiment using larger systems, where the benefits of AOP may be more
noticeable.
  Conclusion: This work contributes with evidence to fill gaps in the body of
quantitative results supporting alleged benefits to software modularity brought
by AOP languages, namely OT/J.

and reaction of interacting particles can be simulated using kinetic Monte
Carlo (kMC) algorithms. Even though kMC methods are accurate, they are
computationally expensive for large-scale systems. Hence approximation
algorithms are necessary for simulating experimentally observed properties and
morphologies. One such approximation method stems from the coarse graining of
the lattice which leads to coarse-grained Monte Carlo (GCMC) methods while
Langevin approximations can further accelerate the simulations. Moreover,
sacrificing fine scale (i.e. microscopic) accuracy, mesoscopic deterministic or
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are efficiently applied for
simulating surface processes. In this paper, we are interested in simulating
surface diffusion for pattern formation applications which is achieved by
suitably discretizing the mesoscopic SPDE in space. The proposed discretization
schemes which are actually Langevin-type approximation models are strongly
connected with the properties of the underlying interacting particle system. In
this direction, the key feature of our schemes is that controlled-error
estimates are provided at three distinct time-scales. Indeed, (a) weak error
analysis of mesoscopic observables, (b) asymptotic equivalence of action
functionals and (c) satisfaction of detailed balance condition, control the
error at finite times, long times and infinite times, respectively. In this
sense, the proposed algorithms provide a ""bridge"" between continuum (S)PDE
models and molecular simulations Numerical simulations, which also take
advantage of acceleration ideas from (S)PDE numerical solutions, validate the
theoretical findings and provide insights to the experimentally observed
pattern formation through self-assembly.

energy effective action and inflation completely characterized in terms of a
small number of parameters. Demanding slow roll inflation significantly
constrains these parameters. In this context, the generic level of fine tuning
can be described as a function of the number of light fields, there is an upper
bound on the scale of inflation, and an (almost) universal prediction for the

was not accessible in traditional Brillouin systems since backscattering
enforces high acoustical frequencies associated with high mechanical damping.
Recently, forward Brillouin scattering in microcavities has allowed access to
low-frequency acoustical modes where mechanical dissipation is lower than
optical dissipation, in accordance with the requirements for cooling. Here we
experimentally demonstrate cooling via such a forward Brillouin process in a

acoustical amplification as is traditional, but also for the first time, a

allocating constrained power to a set of parallel channels to maximize the
total data-rate. It is used widely in practice, for example, for power
allocation to sub-carriers in multi-user OFDM systems such as WiMax. The
classic water-filling algorithm is deterministic and requires perfect knowledge
of the channel gain to noise ratios. In this paper we consider how to do power
allocation over stochastically time-varying (i.i.d.) channels with unknown gain
to noise ratio distributions. We adopt an online learning framework based on
stochastic multi-armed bandits. We consider two variations of the problem, one
in which the goal is to find a power allocation to maximize $\sum\limits_i
\mathbb{E}[\log(1 + SNR_i)]$, and another in which the goal is to find a power
allocation to maximize $\sum\limits_i \log(1 + \mathbb{E}[SNR_i])$. For the
first problem, we propose a \emph{cognitive water-filling} algorithm that we
call CWF1. We show that CWF1 obtains a regret (defined as the cumulative gap
over time between the sum-rate obtained by a distribution-aware genie and this
policy) that grows polynomially in the number of channels and logarithmically
in time, implying that it asymptotically achieves the optimal time-averaged
rate that can be obtained when the gain distributions are known. For the second
problem, we present an algorithm called CWF2, which is, to our knowledge, the
first algorithm in the literature on stochastic multi-armed bandits to exploit
non-linear dependencies between the arms. We prove that the number of times
CWF2 picks the incorrect power allocation is bounded by a function that is
polynomial in the number of channels and logarithmic in time, implying that its
frequency of incorrect allocation tends to zero.

results show that the multiple-beam diffraction effect together with
transmission-induced absorption can noticeably reduce the diffraction

difficulties in background subtraction near that energy make conclusions
difficult. With this, all 6 of the INSs that have confirmed periodicities now
have constrained spin-downs from coherent solutions. The evidence that the INSs
are qualitatively different from rotation-powered pulsars now appears robust,
with the likely conclusion that their characteristic ages are systematically
older than their true ages, because their fields have decayed. The field decay
probably also causes them to be systematically hotter than pulsars of the same

we focus on the bispectrum of the dark matter density field on mildly
non-linear scales. For models with the same initial power spectrum, the dark
matter bispectrum shows significant differences for cases where the final dark
matter power spectrum also differs. Given the different dependence on bias of
the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum, bispectrum measurements can close the
loophole of galaxy bias hiding differences in the power spectrum.
Alternatively, changes in the initial power spectrum can also hide differences.
By constructing LCDM models with very similar final non-linear power spectra,
we show that the differences in the bispectrum are reduced (<4%) and are
comparable with differences in the imperfectly matched power spectra. These
results indicate that the bispectrum depends mainly on the power spectrum and
less sensitively on the gravitational signatures of the f(R) model. This weak
dependence of the matter bispectrum on gravity makes it useful for breaking
degeneracies associated with galaxy bias, even for models beyond general
relativity.

clusters are responsible for the loss of a significant fraction of their
massive stellar content. Some of the escaping (runaway) stars move through the
ambient medium supersonically and can be revealed via detection of their bow
shocks (visible in the infrared, optical or radio). In this paper, which is the
second of a series of papers devoted to the search for OB stars running away
from young (several Myr) Galactic clusters and OB associations, we present the
results of the search for bow shocks around the star-forming region NGC 6357.
Using the archival data of the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) satellite and
the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the preliminary data release of the Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we discovered seven bow shocks, whose geometry
is consistent with the possibility that they are generated by stars expelled
from the young star clusters, Pismis 24 and AH03 J1725-34.4, associated with
NGC 6357. Two of the seven bow shocks are driven by the already known O stars.
Follow-up spectroscopy of three other bow shock-producing stars showed that
they are O-type stars as well, while the 2MASS photometry of the remaining two
stars suggests that they could be B0 V stars, provided that both are located at
the same distance as NGC 6357. Detection of numerous massive stars ejected from
the very young clusters is consistent with the theoretical expectation that
star clusters can effectively lose massive stars at the very beginning of their
dynamical evolution and lends strong support to the idea that probably all
field OB stars have been dynamically ejected from their birth clusters. A
by-product of our search for bow shocks around NGC 6357 is the detection of
three circular shells typical of luminous blue variable and late WN-type
Wolf-Rayet stars.

the precision in number counts reaches 10%. The position of the main-sequence

newly possible with our parametrization of the RGBB. Both brightness and number
counts are shown to have second parameters in addition to their strong

differ from those of the Galactic GC system, with the former having lower
number counts, a lower brightness dispersion and a brighter peak luminosity

the Galactic bulge having a higher helium abundance than expected from GCs,

photometric redshifts and determining redshift distributions using spectroscopy
which is systematically incomplete (e.g., current deep spectroscopic surveys
fail to obtain secure redshifts for 30-50% or more of the galaxies targeted).
In this paper we improve on the redshift distribution reconstruction methods
presented in Matthews & Newman (2010) by incorporating full covariance
information into our correlation function fits. Correlation function
measurements are strongly covariant between angular or spatial bins, and
accounting for this in fitting can yield substantial reduction in errors.
However, frequently the covariance matrices used in these calculations are
determined from a relatively small set (dozens rather than hundreds) of
subsamples or mock catalogs, resulting in noisy covariance matrices whose
inversion is ill-conditioned and numerically unstable. We present here a method
of conditioning the covariance matrix known as ridge regression which results
in a more well behaved inversion than other techniques common in large-scale
structure studies. We demonstrate that ridge regression significantly improves
the determination of correlation function parameters. We then apply these
improved techniques to the problem of reconstructing redshift distributions. By
incorporating full covariance information, applying ridge regression, and
changing the weighting of fields in obtaining average correlation functions, we
obtain reductions in the mean redshift distribution reconstruction error of as
much as ~40% compared to previous methods. In an appendix, we provide a
description of POWERFIT, an IDL code for performing power-law fits to
correlation functions with ridge regression conditioning that we are making
publicly available.

evaluate the Casimir force between smooth objects at small distances. In spite
of being intuitively easy to grasp, it is generally believed to be an
uncontrolled approximation. Indeed, its validity has only been tested in
particular examples, by confronting its predictions with the next to leading
order (NTLO) correction extracted from numerical or analytical solutions
obtained without using the PFA. In this article we show that the PFA and its
NTLO correction may be derived within a single framework, as the first two
terms in a derivative expansion. To that effect, we consider the Casimir energy
for a vacuum scalar field with Dirichlet conditions on a smooth curved surface
described by a function $\psi$ in front of a plane. By regarding the Casimir
energy as a functional of $\psi$, we show that the PFA is the leading term in a

show, by evaluating this correction term for particular geometries, that it

planetary nebula (PN) progenitor stars via s-process nucleosynthesis, have been
detected in nearly 100 PNe. This demonstrates that nebular spectroscopy is a
potentially powerful tool for studying the production and chemical evolution of
trans-iron elements. However, significant challenges must be addressed before
this goal can be achieved. One of the most substantial hurdles is the lack of
atomic data for n-capture elements, particularly that needed to solve for their
ionization equilibrium (and hence to convert ionic abundances to elemental
abundances). To address this need, we have computed photoionization cross
sections and radiative and dielectronic recombination rate coefficients for the
first six ions of Se and Kr. The calculations were benchmarked against
experimental photoionization cross section measurements. In addition, we
computed charge transfer (CT) rate coefficients for ions of six n-capture
elements. These efforts will enable the accurate determination of nebular Se
and Kr abundances, allowing robust investigations of s-process enrichments in
PNe.

examples. A diagnostic policy is a complete description of the decision-making
actions of a diagnostician (i.e., tests followed by a diagnostic decision) for
all possible combinations of test results. An optimal diagnostic policy is one
that minimizes the expected total cost, which is the sum of measurement costs
and misdiagnosis costs. In most diagnostic settings, there is a tradeoff
between these two kinds of costs. This paper formalizes diagnostic decision
making as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper introduces a new family of
systematic search algorithms based on the AO* algorithm to solve this MDP. To
make AO* efficient, the paper describes an admissible heuristic that enables
AO* to prune large parts of the search space. The paper also introduces several
greedy algorithms including some improvements over previously-published
methods. The paper then addresses the question of learning diagnostic policies
from examples. When the probabilities of diseases and test results are computed
from training data, there is a great danger of overfitting. To reduce
overfitting, regularizers are integrated into the search algorithms. Finally,
the paper compares the proposed methods on five benchmark diagnostic data sets.
The studies show that in most cases the systematic search methods produce
better diagnostic policies than the greedy methods. In addition, the studies
show that for training sets of realistic size, the systematic search algorithms
are practical on todays desktop computers.

the concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a

presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid
pseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence
importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph
representation of sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on
intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph
representation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in first place
in more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we
present a detailed analysis of our approach and apply it to a larger data set

compute centrality using the similarity graph. The results show that
degree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods

LexRank with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques

representation of team plans. Despite their promise, current BDI team
approaches lack tools for quantitative performance analysis under uncertainty.
Distributed partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) are well
suited for such analysis, but the complexity of finding optimal policies in
such models is highly intractable. The key contribution of this article is a
hybrid BDI-POMDP approach, where BDI team plans are exploited to improve POMDP
tractability and POMDP analysis improves BDI team plan performance. Concretely,
we focus on role allocation, a fundamental problem in BDI teams: which agents
to allocate to the different roles in the team. The article provides three key
contributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into
account future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role
allocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce
RMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model
for analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by
significantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans
provide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps
in such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our
second key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve
RMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role
allocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and
evaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our
decomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to
significantly prune the search space of role allocations. Our third key
contribution is a significantly faster policy evaluation algorithm suited for
our BDI-POMDP hybrid approach. Finally, we also present experimental results
from two domains: mission rehearsal simulation and RoboCupRescue disaster
rescue simulation.

processes (POMDPs) to multi-agent settings by incorporating the notion of agent
models into the state space. Agents maintain beliefs over physical states of
the environment and over models of other agents, and they use Bayesian updates
to maintain their beliefs over time. The solutions map belief states to
actions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related
to agent types considered in games of incomplete information. We express the
agents autonomy by postulating that their models are not directly manipulable
or observable by other agents. We show that important properties of POMDPs,
such as convergence of value iteration, the rate of convergence, and piece-wise
linearity and convexity of the value functions carry over to our framework. Our
approach complements a more traditional approach to interactive settings which
uses Nash equilibria as a solution paradigm. We seek to avoid some of the
drawbacks of equilibria which may be non-unique and do not capture
off-equilibrium behaviors. We do so at the cost of having to represent, process
and continuously revise models of other agents. Since the agents beliefs may be
arbitrarily nested, the optimal solutions to decision making problems are only
asymptotically computable. However, approximate belief updates and
approximately optimal plans are computable. We illustrate our framework using a
simple application domain, and we show examples of belief updates and value
functions.

task-oriented design dialogues to develop feature sets based on Dale and
Reiters (1995) incremental model, Brennan and Clarks (1996) conceptual pact
model, and Jordans (2000b) intentional influences model, and use these feature
sets in a machine learning experiment to automatically learn a model of content
selection for object descriptions. Since Dale and Reiters model requires a
representation of discourse structure, the corpus annotations are used to
derive a representation based on Grosz and Sidners (1986) theory of the
intentional structure of discourse, as well as two very simple representations
of discourse structure based purely on recency. We then apply the
rule-induction program RIPPER to train and test the content selection component
of an object description generator on a set of 393 object descriptions from the
corpus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported experiment of a trainable
content selection component for object description generation in dialogue.
Three separate content selection models that are based on the three theoretical
models, all independently achieve accuracies significantly above the majority
class baseline (17%) on unseen test data, with the intentional influences model
(42.4%) performing significantly better than either the incremental model
(30.4%) or the conceptual pact model (28.9%). But the best performing models
combine all the feature sets, achieving accuracies near 60%. Surprisingly, a
simple recency-based representation of discourse structure does as well as one

kernel function. Focusing on the well known Perceptron and Winnow algorithms,
the paper demonstrates a tradeoff between the computational efficiency with
which the algorithm can be run over the expanded feature space and the
generalization ability of the corresponding learning algorithm. We first
describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of
conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to
efficiently run the Perceptron algorithm over a feature space of exponentially
many conjunctions; however we also show that using such kernels, the Perceptron
algorithm can provably make an exponential number of mistakes even when
learning simple functions. We then consider the question of whether kernel
functions can analogously be used to run the multiplicative-update Winnow
algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions.
Known upper bounds imply that the Winnow algorithm can learn Disjunctive Normal
Form (DNF) formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting. However,
we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnows behavior for
learning DNF over such a feature set. This implies that the kernel functions

Since the modeling and computational complexities entailed by maintaining this
proper distinction are often prohibitive, one asks for conditions under which
it can be safely ignored. Such conditions are given by the missing at random
(mar) and coarsened at random (car) assumptions. In this paper we provide an
in-depth analysis of several questions relating to mar/car assumptions. Main
purpose of our study is to provide criteria by which one may evaluate whether a
car assumption is reasonable for a particular data collecting or observational
process. This question is complicated by the fact that several distinct
versions of mar/car assumptions exist. We therefore first provide an overview
over these different versions, in which we highlight the distinction between
distributional and coarsening variable induced versions. We show that
distributional versions are less restrictive and sufficient for most
applications. We then address from two different perspectives the question of
when the mar/car assumption is warranted. First we provide a static analysis
that characterizes the admissibility of the car assumption in terms of the
support structure of the joint probability distribution of complete data and
incomplete observations. Here we obtain an equivalence characterization that
improves and extends a recent result by Grunwald and Halpern. We then turn to a
procedural analysis that characterizes the admissibility of the car assumption
in terms of procedural models for the actual data (or observation) generating
process. The main result of this analysis is that the stronger coarsened

the value of each point in the belief set is improved; the key observation is
that a single backup may improve the value of many belief points. Contrary to

many large relational MDPs, where reward is extremely sparse, as API is
ineffective in such domains when initialized with an uninformed policy. Our

near-equality case of the Positive Mass Theorem. We study the near-equality
case of the Penrose Inequality for the class of complete asymptotically flat
rotationally symmetric Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature
whose boundaries are outermost minimal hypersurfaces. Specifically, we prove
that if the Penrose Inequality is sufficiently close to being an equality on
one of these manifolds, then it must be close to a Schwarzschild space with an
appended cylinder, in the sense of Lipschitz Distance. Since the Lipschitz
Distance bounds the Intrinsic Flat Distance on compact sets, we also obtain a
result for Intrinsic Flat Distance, which is a more appropriate distance for
more general near-equality results, as discussed in [LS]

a drop in the surface density of stars very near Sgr A*. Our analysis confirms
that a previously reported drop in the surface brightness within 0.8"" of Sgr A*
is an artifact of bright and massive stars near that radius. We also show that
the surface brightness profile within 5"" or ~0.2 pc of Sgr A* can be fitted
with broken power laws. The power laws are consistent with previous
measurements, in that the profile becomes shallower at small radii. For radii >
0.7"" the slope is beta=-0.34\pm0.04 where Sigma is proportional to r^beta and
becomes flatter at smaller radii with beta=-0.13\pm0.04. Modeling of the
surface brightness profile gives a stellar density that increases roughly as
r^-1 within the inner 1"" of Sgr A*. This slope confirms earlier measurements in
that it is not consistent with that expected from an old, dynamically-relaxed
stellar cluster with a central supermassive black hole. Assuming that the
diffuse emission is not contaminated by a faint population of young stars down
to the 17.1 magnitude limit of our imaging data at 1.70$\mu$, the shallow cusp
profile is not consistent with a decline in stellar density in the inner
arcsecond. In addition, converting our measured diffuse light profile to a
stellar mass profile, with the assumption that the light is dominated by K0
dwarfs, the enclosed stellar mass within radius r < 0.1 pc of Sgr A* is ~
3.2x10^4 M_solar (r/0.1 {pc})^2.1.

An important question in these models is whether there exists consistency
between coupling unification and type II seesaw dominance. Scenarios where this
consistency can be demonstrated have been given in a SUSY framework. In this
paper we give examples where type II dominance occurs in SO(10) models without
supersymmetry but with additional TeV scale particles and also in models with
split-supersummetry. Grand unification is realized in a two-step process via
breaking of SO(10) to SU(5) and then to a TeV scale standard model supplemented
by extra fields and an SU(5) Higgs multiplet ${15}_H$ at a scale about
$10^{12}$ GeV to give type-II seesaw. The predictions for proton lifetime in
these models are in the range $\tau_p^0 = 2\times 10^{35}$ yrs. to $\tau_p^0 =
6\times 10^{35}$ yrs.. A number of recent numerical fits to GUT-scale fermion
masses can be accommodated within this model.

the normal speed of motion is a homogeneous degree one, concave or convex

Precisely, the function which gives the curvature of the largest interior
sphere touching the hypersurface at each point is a subsolution of the
linearized flow equation if the speed is concave. If the speed is convex then
there is an analogous statement for exterior spheres. In particular, if the
hypersurface moves with positive speed and the speed is concave in the

paradigmatic problem in frustrated magnetism. Even in the classical limit, its
properties are far from simple. The ""120 degree"" ground state favoured by the
frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions contains a hidden chiral symmetry,
and supports two distinct types of excitation. And famously, three distinct
phases, including a collinear one-third magnetisation plateau, are stabilised
by thermal fluctuations in applied magnetic field. The questions of
symmetry-breaking raised by this model are deep and subtle, and after more than
thirty years of study, many of the details of its phase diagram remain
surprisingly obscure. In this paper we use modern Monte Carlo simulation
techniques to determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical
Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice in applied magnetic field.
At low to intermediate values of magnetic field, we find evidence for a
continuous phase transition from the paramagnet into the collinear one-third
magnetisation plateau, belonging to the three-state Potts universality class.
We also find evidence for conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transitions from the one-third magnetisation plateau into the canted ""Y-state"",
and into the 2:1 canted phase found at high fields. However, the phase
transition from the paramagnet into the 2:1 canted phase, while continuous,
does not appear to fall into any conventional universality class. We argue that
this, like the chiral phase transition discussed in zero field, deserves
further study as an interesting example of a finite-temperature phase
transition with compound order-parameter symmetry. We comment on the relevance
of these results for experiments on magnetic materials with a triangular
lattice.

control theory, communication theory and signal processing. A basic
mathematical challenge that arises in the context of geophysical imaging is to
understand the structure of linear operators preserving the class of minimum
phase functions. The heart of the matter is an inverse problem: to reconstruct
an unknown minimum phase preserving operator from its value on a limited set of
test functions. This entails, as a preliminary step, ascertaining sets of test
functions that determine the operator, as well as the derivation of a
corresponding reconstruction scheme. In the present paper we exploit a recent
breakthrough in the theory of stable polynomials to solve the stated inverse
problem completely. We prove that a minimum phase preserving operator on the
half line can be reconstructed from data consisting of its value on precisely
two test functions. And we derive an explicit integral representation of the
unknown operator in terms of this data. A remarkable corollary of the solution
is that if a linear minimum phase preserving operator has rank at least two,
then it is necessarily injective.

dependence of the SC gap of TmNi2B2C determined from Andreev-reflection (AR)
spectra using the standard single-gap approximation (SGA) deviates from the BCS
behavior in displaying a maximum at about Tc/2. A refined analysis within the
two-gap approximation provides evidence for the presence of a second gap twice
as large as the main gap (the first one), while the latter is close to that
within the SGA. This way, TmNi2B2C expands the number of nickel borocarbide
superconductors which exhibit a clear multiband character. Additionally, for
the first time ""reentrant"" features were found in the AR spectra for some PCs
measured in a magnetic field. The PC spectroscopy of the electron-boson
interaction in TmNi2B2C in the normal state reveals a pronounced phonon maximum
at 9.5meV and a more smeared one around 15 meV, while at higher energies the PC
spectra are almost featureless. Additionally, the most intense peak slightly
above 3meV observed in the PC spectra of TmNi2B2C is presumably caused by
crystalline-electric-field (CEF) excitations. The peak near 1meV detected for
some PC spectra is connected with a modification of the CEF probably due to
boron or carbon vacancies, allowing to probe the local stoichiometry by PC
spectroscopy.

belonging to lineages that have experienced little evolutionary change, and
suggested that species in more slowly evolving lineages are more prone to
extinction (1). Recent studies revealed that some living fossils such as the
lungfish are indeed evolving more slowly than other vertebrates (2, 3). The
reason for the slower rate of evolution in these lineages remains unclear, but
the same observations suggest a possible genome size effect on rates of
evolution. Genome size (C-value) in vertebrates varies over 200 fold ranging
from pufferfish (0.4 pg) to lungfish (132.8 pg) (4). Variation in genome size
and architecture is a fundamental cellular adaptation that remains poorly
understood (5). C-value is correlated with several allometric traits such as
body size and developmental rates in many, but not all, organisms (6, 7). To
date, no consensus exists concerning the mechanisms driving genome size
evolution or the effect that genome size has on species traits such as
evolutionary rates (8-12). In the following we show that: 1) within the same
range of divergence times, genetic diversity decreases as genome size increases
and 2) average rates of molecular evolution decline with increasing genome size
in vertebrates. Together, these observations indicate that genome size is an
important factor influencing rates of speciation and extinction.

of how the simulated fluid should be discretized. Traditionally, a fixed
Eulerian mesh is often employed for this purpose, which in modern schemes may
also be adaptively refined during a calculation. Particle-based methods on the
other hand discretize the mass instead of the volume, yielding an approximately
Lagrangian approach. It is also possible to achieve Lagrangian behavior in
mesh-based methods if the mesh is allowed to move with the flow. However, such
approaches have often been fraught with substantial problems related to the
development of irregularity in the mesh topology. Here we describe a novel
scheme that eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured
mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh
is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a
finite volume approach, based on a second-order Godunov scheme with an exact
Riemann solver. A particularly powerful feature of the approach is that the
mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are given
the velocity of the local flow, a highly accurate Lagrangian formulation of
continuum hydrodynamics is obtained that is free of mesh distortion problems,
while it is at the same time fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian
codes. We describe the formulation and implementation of our new Voronoi-based
hydrodynamics, and we discuss a number of illustrative test problems that
highlight its performance in practical applications.

allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a
property that makes the scheme ideal for many applications in astrophysics,
where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the
derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an
overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative
transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics or magnetic fields. We also
briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in
astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the
accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements
of its convergence rate for important classes of problems.

systems of differential equation in the framework of extension theory of

$A$ is a symmetric linear relation in $\gH, \cH_0$ is a boundary Hilbert space
and $\cH_1$ is a subspace in $\cH_0$. Unlike known concept of a boundary
relation (boundary triplet) for $A^*$ our definition of $\G$ is applicable to
relations $A$ with possibly unequal deficiency indices $n_\pm(A)$. Next we
develop the known results on minimal and maximal relations induced by the
general canonical system $ J y'(t)-B(t)y(t)=\D (t)f(t)$ on an interval
$\cI=(a,b),\; -\infty\leq a<b\leq\infty $ and then by using a special (so
called decomposing) boundary relation for $\Tma$ we describe in terms of
boundary conditions proper extensions of $\Tmi$ in the case of the regular
endpoint $a$ and arbitrary (possibly unequal) deficiency indices $n_\pm
(\Tmi)$. If the system is definite, then decomposing boundary relation $\G$
turns into the decomposing boundary triplet $\Pi=\bt$ for $\Tma$. Using such a
triplet we show that self-adjoint decomposing boundary conditions exist only
for Hamiltonian systems; moreover, we describe all such conditions in the
compact form. These results are generalizations of the known results by
Rofe-Beketov on regular differential operators. We characterize also all
maximal dissipative and accumulative separated boundary conditions, which exist
for arbitrary (not necessarily Hamiltonian) definite canonical systems.

the size of the smallest net approximately representing the answers to that
class of queries. We show that this in particular implies a mechanism for
counting queries that gives error guarantees that grow only with the
VC-dimension of the class of queries, which itself grows only logarithmically
with the size of the query class.
  We also show that it is not possible to privately release even simple classes
of queries (such as intervals and their generalizations) over continuous
domains. Despite this, we give a privacy-preserving polynomial time algorithm
that releases information useful for all halfspace queries, given a slight
relaxation of the utility guarantee. This algorithm does not release synthetic
data, but instead another data structure capable of representing an answer for
each query. We also give an efficient algorithm for releasing synthetic data

linear feature (G315.78-0.23) extending 10' radially outward from the rim of
the shell. We present radio imaging and polarization observations obtained from
the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the Australia Telescope
Compact Array, confirming G315.78-0.23 as a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
powered by the young pulsar J1437-5959. This is one of the longest pulsar tails
observed in radio and it has a physical extent over 20 pc. We found a bow-shock
stand-off distance of 0.002 pc, smallest among similar systems, suggesting a
large pulsar velocity over 1000 km/s and a high Mach number ~200. The magnetic
field geometry inferred from radio polarimetry shows a good alignment with the
tail orientation, which could be a result of high flow speed. There are also
hints that the postshock wind has a low magnetization and is dominated by
electrons and positrons in energy. This study shows that PWNe can offer a
powerful probe of their local environment, particularly for the case of a bow
shock where the parent supernova shell is also detected.

opportunity to investigate binding between nuclei particles and its properties
that arises during collision in a fusion reaction. A fully classical approach
is used to observe the influence of initial angle of nucleus orientation to the
product yielded by the reaction. As an example, a simplest fusion reaction
between 1H2 and 1H3 is observed. Several products of the fusion reaction have
been obtained, even the unreported ones, including temporary 2He4 nucleus.
