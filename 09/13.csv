a hyperboloidal transformation which allows direct access to null infinity and

We show that this method is ideal for attaching hyperboloidal slices or for

goal of ALMA. The analysis relies on a semi-analytic model, which permits the
construction of a MW progenitor sample by backtracking the cosmic history of
all simulated present-day galaxies similar to the real MW. Results: (i) ALMA
can best observe a MW at z=3 by looking at CO(3-2) emission. The probability of
detecting a random model MW at 3-sigma in 24 h using 75 km/s channels is
roughly 50%, and these odds can be increased by co-adding the CO(3-2) and
CO(4-3) lines. These lines fall into ALMA band 3, which therefore represents
the optimal choice towards MW detections at z=3. (ii) Higher CO transitions
contained in the ALMA bands geq6 will be invisible, unless the considered MW
progenitor coincidentally hosts a major starburst or an active black hole.
(iii) The high-frequency array of SKA, fitted with 28.8 GHz receivers, would be
a powerful instrument for observing CO(1-0) at z=3, able to detect nearly all
simulated MWs in 24 h. (iv) HI detections in MWs at z=3 using the low-frequency
array of SKA will be impossible in any reasonable observing time. (v) SKA will
nonetheless be a supreme ha survey instrument through its enormous
instantaneous field-of-view (FoV). A one year pointed HI survey with an assumed
FoV of 410 sqdeg would reveal at least 10^5 galaxies at z=2.95-3.05. (vi) If
the positions and redshifts of those galaxies are known from an
optical/infrared spectroscopic survey, stacking allows the detection of HI at
z=3 in less than 24 h.

sufficient to drive volume phase transitions and criticality, even in the
absence of a self-attracting or elastic network. Our result follows from a
Landau mean-field theory for a system of confined ions in an external solution
of mixed-valence counterions, where the ratio of squared monovalent to divalent
ion concentration provides a temperature-like variable for the phase
transition. Our analysis was motivated by long-studied volume phase transitions
via ion exchange in ionic gels, but our findings agree with existing theory for
volume-temperature phase transitions in charged hard-sphere models and other
systems by Fisher and Levin, and McGahay and Tomozawa. Our mean-field model
predicts a continuous line of gas-liquid-type critical points connecting a
purely monovalent, divalent-sensitive critical point at one extreme with a
divalent, monovalent-sensitive critical point at the other; an alternative
representation of the Landau functional handles this second limit. It follows
that critical sensitivity to ion valence is tunable to any desired valence
ratio. The critical or discontinuous dependent variable can be the confinement
volume; alternatively the internal electrical potential may be more convenient
in applications. Our simplified conditions for ionic phase transitions to
occur, together with our relatively simple theory to describe them, may
facilitate exploration of tunable critical sensitivity in areas such as ion
detection technology, biological switches and osmotic control.

the Main Belt and NEA size distributions. This code includes catastrophic
collisions and noncollisional removal processes such as the Yarkovsky effect
and the orbital resonances. The model assumes that the dynamical depletion of
the early Main Belt was very strong, and owing to that, most Main Belt
comminution occurred when its dynamical structure was similar to the present
one. Our results indicate that the number of D > 1 km Main Belt asteroids
striking Ceres and Vesta over the Solar System history are approximately 4 600
and 1 100 respectively. The largest Main Belt asteroids expected to have
impacted Ceres and Vesta had diameters of 71.7 km and 21.1 km. The number of D
> 0.1 km craters on Ceres is \sim 3.4 \times 10^8 and 6.2 \times 10^7 on Vesta.
The number of craters with D > 100 km are 47 on Ceres and 8 on Vesta. Our study
indicates that the D = 460 km crater observed on Vesta had to be formed by the
impact of a D \sim 66.2 km projectile, which has a probability of occurr \sim
30% over the Solar System history. If significant discrepancies between our
results about the cratering on Ceres and Vesta and data obtained from the Dawn
Mission were found, they should be linked to a higher degree of collisional
evolution during the early Main Belt and/or the existence of the late heavy
bombardment. An increase in the collisional activity in the early phase may be
provided for an initial configuration of the giant planets consistent with, for
example, the Nice model. From this, the Dawn Mission would be able to give us
clues about the initial configuration of the early Solar System and its
subsequent dynamical evolution.

to calculate the quantum critical parameters for a given Hamiltonian. This
approach has been shown to give very accurate results for critical parameters
by using a systematic expansion with global basis-type functions. Recently, the
finite element method was shown to be a powerful numerical method for ab initio
electronic structure calculations with a variable real-space resolution. In
this work, we demonstrate how to obtain quantum critical parameters by
combining the finite element method (FEM) with finite size scaling (FSS) using
different ab initio approximations and exact formulations. The critical
parameters could be atomic nuclear charges, internuclear distances, electron
density, disorder, lattice structure, and external fields for stability of
atomic, molecular systems and quantum phase transitions of extended systems. To
illustrate the effectiveness of this approach we provide detailed calculations
of applying FEM to approximate solutions for the two-electron atom with varying
nuclear charge; these include Hartree-Fock, density functional theory under the
local density approximation, and an ""exact""' formulation using FEM. We then use
the FSS approach to determine its critical nuclear charge for stability; here,
the size of the system is related to the number of elements used in the
calculations. Results prove to be in good agreement with previous Slater-basis
set calculations and demonstrate that it is possible to combine finite size
scaling with the finite-element method by using ab initio calculations to
obtain quantum critical parameters. The combined approach provides a promising
first-principles approach to describe quantum phase transitions for materials
and extended systems.

Fourier decomposition of 2D angular correlations projected onto 1D azimuth. In

high Galactic latitude clouds, DCld 300.2-16.9 and LDN 1780. The detection of
these lines raises important questions regarding the physical conditions inside
low-extinction clouds that are far from ultraviolet radiation sources. The
ratio between the S(2) flux and the flux from PAHs at 7.9 microns averages
0.007 for these 6 positions. This is a factor of about 4 higher than the same
ratio measured towards the central regions of non-active Galaxies in the
Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). Thus the environment of these
translucent clouds is more efficient at producing rotationally excited H2 per
PAH-exciting photon than the disks of entire galaxies. Excitation analysis
finds that the S(1) and S(2) emitting regions are warm (T >300K), but comprise
no more than 2% of the gas mass. We find that UV photons cannot be the sole
source of excitation in these regions and suggest mechanical heating via shocks
or turbulent dissipation as the dominant cause of the emission. The clouds are
located on the outskirts of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association and may be
dissipating recent bursts of mechanical energy input from supernova explosions.
We suggest that pockets of warm gas in diffuse or translucent clouds,

interactions between the fluid flow, ciliary deformation and applied magnetic
field. When a rotating magnetic field is applied to super-paramagnetic
artificial cilia, they mimic the asymmetric motion of natural cilia, consisting
of an effective and recovery stroke. When a phase-difference is prescribed
between neighbouring cilia, metachronal waves develop. Due to the discrete
nature of the cilia, the metachronal waves change direction when the phase
difference becomes sufficiently large, resulting in antiplectic as well as
symplectic metachrony. We show that the fluid flow created by the artificial
cilia is significantly enhanced in the presence of metachronal waves and that
the fluid flow becomes unidirectional. Antiplectic metachrony is observed to
lead to a considerable enhancement in flow compared to symplectic metachrony,
when the cilia spacing is small. Obstruction of flow in the direction of the
effective stroke for the case of symplectic metachrony was found to be the key
mechanism that governs this effect.

bursting neurons are common in a variety of neural systems from central pattern
generators to human brain circuits. One example of the latter is the
subcortical network of the basal ganglia, formed by excitatory and inhibitory
bursters of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, involved in motor
control and affected in Parkinson's disease. Recent experiments have
demonstrated the intermittent nature of the phase-locking of neural activity in
this network. Here we explore one potential mechanism to explain the
intermittent phase-locking in a network. We simplify the network to obtain a
model of two inhibitory coupled elements and explore its dynamics. We used
geometric analysis and singular perturbation methods for dynamical systems to
reduce the full model to a simpler set of equations. Mathematical analysis was
completed using three slow variables with two different time scales.
Intermittently synchronous oscillations are generated by overlapped spiking
which crucially depends on the geometry of the slow phase plane and the
interplay between slow variables as well as the strength of synapses. Two slow
variables are responsible for the generation of activity patterns with
overlapped spiking and the other slower variable enhances the robustness of an
irregular and intermittent activity pattern. While the analyzed network and the
explored mechanism of intermittent synchrony appear to be quite generic, the
results of this analysis can be used to trace particular values of biophysical
parameters (synaptic strength and parameters of calcium dynamics), which are
known to be impacted in Parkinson's disease.

turns on the water tap that she also connected to one of the pipes. Then, the
water comes out on Alice's or Bob's side depending on the function value
f(x,y).
  We prove almost-linear lower bounds on the garden-hose complexity for
concrete functions like inner product, majority, and equality, and we show the
existence of functions with exponential garden-hose complexity. Furthermore, we
show a connection to classical complexity theory by proving that all functions
computable in log-space have polynomial garden-hose complexity.
  We consider a randomized variant of the garden-hose complexity, where Alice
and Bob hold pre-shared randomness, and a quantum variant, where Alice and Bob
hold pre-shared quantum entanglement, and we show that the randomized
garden-hose complexity is within a polynomial factor of the deterministic
garden-hose complexity. Examples of (partial) functions are given where the
quantum garden-hose complexity is logarithmic in n while the classical
garden-hose complexity can be lower bounded by n^c for constant c>0.
  Finally, we show an interesting connection between the garden-hose model and

SMA observations of the N2H+ J=3-2, HCO+ J=3-2 and DCO+ J=3-2 lines to
constrain the ionization fraction, xi, in three temperature regions in the disk

warm, upper layer with T>20 K where CO is in the gas-phase and HCO+ is most
abundant, where we estimate xi \simeq 4 \times 10-10, (2) a cooler molecular
layer with T = 16-20 K where N2H+ and DCO+ abundances are predicted to peak,
with xi \simeq 3\times10-11, and (3) the cold, dense midplane with T<16 K where
H3+ and its deuterated isotopologues are the main carriers of positive charge,
with xi < 3\times10-10. While there are considerable uncertainties, these
estimates are consistent with a decreasing ionization fraction into the deeper,
colder, and denser disk layers. Stronger constraints on the ionization fraction
in the disk midplane will require not only substantially more sensitive

region of a wireless network under the assumption that mutual information
accumulation is implemented at the physical layer. When the link quality
between nodes is not sufficiently high that a packet can be decoded within a
single slot, the system can accumulate information across multiple slots,
eventually decoding the packet. The result is an expanded stability region. The
accumulation process over weak links is temporally coupled and therefore does
not satisfy the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption that
underlies many previous analysis in this area. Therefore the problem setting
also poses new analytic challenges. We propose two dynamic scheduling
algorithms to cope with the non-i.i.d nature of the decoding. The first
performs scheduling every $T$ slots, and approaches the boundary of the
stability region as $T$ gets large, but at the cost of increased average delay.
The second introduces virtual queues for each link and constructs a virtual
system wherein two virtual nodes are introduced for each link. The constructed
virtual system is shown to have the same stability region as the original
system. Through controlling the virtual queues in the constructed system, we
avoid the non-i.i.d analysis difficulty and attain the full stability region.
We derive performance bounds for both algorithms and compare them through
simulation results.

stimulates a discussion of the fundamental properties of life as well as
quantum mechanics. In this discussion often concepts are used that originate in
philosophy and ask for a philosophical analysis. In the present work the
classic philosophical tradition based on Aristotle and Aquinas is employed
which surprisingly is able to shed light on important aspects. Especially one
could mention the high degree of unity in living objects and the occurrence of
thorough qualitative changes. The latter are outside the scope of classical
physics where changes are restricted to geometrical rearrangement of
microscopic particles. A challenging approach is used in the philosophical
analysis as the empirical evidence is not taken from everyday life but from
20th century science (quantum mechanics) and recent results in the field of
quantum biology. In the discussion it is argued that quantum entanglement is
possibly related to the occurrence of life. Finally it is recommended that
scientists and philosophers should be open for dialogue that could enrich both.
Scientists could redirect their investigation, as paradigm shifts like the one
originating from philosophical evaluation of quantum mechanics give new insight
about the relation between the whole en the parts. Whereas philosophers could
use scientific results as a consistency check for their philosophical framework
for understanding reality.

Our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (Lx ~ 1E42-1E44 erg/s) AGN at
1.5<z<2.5 that are selected using the 4 Msec Chandra observations in the
Chandra Deep Field South, the deepest X-ray observations to date. Employing
visual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies of
the AGN host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216
non-active galaxies at the same redshift. We find that most of the AGN reside
in disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids
(27.8%). Roughly 16.7% of the AGN hosts have highly disturbed morphologies and
appear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts
(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. These fractions are
statistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that show
similar morphological disturbances. These results suggest that the hosts of
moderate-luminosity AGN are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing merger
or interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. The high
disk fraction observed among the AGN hosts also appears to be at odds with
predictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant AGN fueling
mode at z~2, even at moderate X-ray luminosities. Although we cannot rule out
that minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presence
of a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests that
secular processes play a greater role in fueling AGN activity at z~2 than
previously thought.

local shearing box simulations with the grid-based code Athena at high spatial
resolution (256 grid points per scale height h). The nonlinear evolution
results in the wave steepening into a shock, causing damping and angular
momentum transfer to the disk. On long timescales this leads to spatial
redistribution of the disk density, causing migration feedback and potentially
resulting in gap opening. Previous numerical studies concentrated on exploring
these secondary phenomena as probes of the nonlinear wave evolution. Here we
focus on exploring the evolution of the basic wave properties, such as its
density profile evolution, shock formation, post-shock wave behavior, and
provide comparison with analytical theory. The generation of potential
vorticity at the shock is computed analytically and is subsequently verified by
simulations and used to pinpoint the shock location. We confirm the theoretical
relation between the shocking length and the planet mass (including the effect
of the equation of state), and the post-shock decay of the angular momentum
flux carried by the wave. The post-shock evolution of the wave profile is
explored, and we quantitatively confirm its convergence to the theoretically
expected N-wave shape. The accuracy of various numerical algorithms used to
compute the nonlinear wave evolution is also investigated: we find that higher

existence of codes that are capacity-achieving for the task of sending
classical data over a channel with classical inputs and quantum outputs.
Although they demonstrated the existence of such codes, their proof does not
provide an explicit construction of codes for this task. The aim of the present
paper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit ""polar"" codes that are
capacity-achieving. The codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenon
observed by Arikan for the case of classical channels. Channel polarization is
an effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by ""channel combining""
and ""channel splitting,"" in which a fraction of the synthesized channels are
perfect for data transmission while the other fraction are completely useless
for data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of the
channel. The channel polarization effect then leads to a simple scheme for data
transmission: send the information bits through the perfect channels and
""frozen"" bits through the useless ones. The main technical contributions of the
present paper are threefold. First, we leverage several known results from the
quantum information literature to demonstrate that the channel polarization
effect occurs for channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs. We then
construct linear polar codes based on this effect, and the encoding complexity
is O(N log N), where N is the blocklength of the code. We also demonstrate that
a quantum successive cancellation decoder works well, in the sense that the
word error rate decays exponentially with the blocklength of the code. For this
last result, we exploit Sen's recent ""non-commutative union bound"" that holds
for a sequence of projectors applied to a quantum state.

delays are most useful when observations permit detailed lens modeling and
variability studies, requiring high resolution imaging, long time monitoring,
and rapid cadence. We quantify the constraints possible between a sample of 150
such time delay lenses and a near term supernova program, such as might become
available from an Antarctic telescope such as KDUST and the Dark Energy Survey.
Adding time delay data to supernovae plus cosmic microwave background
information can improve the dark energy figure of merit by almost a factor 5
and determine the matter density \Omega_m to 0.004, Hubble constant h to 0.7%,
and dark energy equation of state time variation w_a to 0.26, systematics

lensing properties as part of the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS) from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Mass modelling of the strong lensing information
from the giant arcs is combined with weak lensing measurements from deep
Subaru/Suprime-cam images to primarily obtain robust constraints on the
concentration parameter and the shape of the mass distribution. We find that
the concentration c_vir is a steep function of the mass, c_vir \propto
M_vir^-0.59\pm0.12, with the value roughly consistent with the
lensing-bias-corrected theoretical expectation for high mass (10^15 h^-1 M_sun)
clusters. However, the observationally inferred concentration parameters appear
to be much higher at lower masses (10^14 h^-1 M_sun), possibly a consequence of
the modification to the inner density profiles provided by baryon cooling. The
steep mass-concentration relation is also supported from direct stacking
analysis of the tangential shear profiles. In addition, we explore the
two-dimensional shape of the projected mass distribution by stacking weak
lensing shear maps of individual clusters with prior information on the
position angle from strong lens modelling, and find significant evidence for a
large mean ellipticity with the best-fit value of e = 0.47 \pm 0.06 for the
mass distribution of the stacked sample. We find that the luminous cluster
member galaxy distribution traces the overall mass distribution very well,
although the distribution of fainter cluster galaxies appears to be more
extended than the total mass.

consecutive orders in a star is approximately proportional to the square root
of its mean density. To determine the large frequency separation as accurately
as possible a mean large frequency separation computed over several orders is
often used. It is, however, known that the large frequency separation varies
with frequency in a second order effect. From observations it has been shown
that this frequency dependence is more important for main-sequence stars than
it is for red-giant stars. Here we use YREC models to verify and explain this
observational result. We find that for stars with R > 8 Rsun the effect of the
Helium second ionisation zone is relatively small. For these stars the deep
location of the He II zone induces a frequency modulation covering only a few
large separations, while the amplitude of the modulation is low due to the
relatively weak and extended He II layer, causing a shallow wide depression in
the first adiabatic exponent. For less evolved stars the He II zone is located
closer to the surface, and it is more confined, i.e. a deep narrow depression
in the first adiabatic exponent. This causes frequency modulations with
relatively high amplitudes covering up to about 20 large separations, inducing
a relatively large frequency modulation. Additionally, we find that for less
evolved stars the He II zone is stronger and more localised for more massive
stars and for stars with low metallicities further increasing the amplitude of
the frequency modulation.

classic eruptive state of luminous blue variables (LBVs) because it requires
very high mass loss rates, Mdot>10^(-2.5) Msun/year, for grains to grow and for
the non-dust optical depth of the wind to shield the dust formation region from
the true stellar photosphere. Thus, dusty shells around hot stars trace the
history of ""great"" eruptions, and the statistics of such shells in the Galaxy
indicate that these eruptions are likely the dominant mass loss mechanism for
evolved, M>40Msun stars. Dust formation at such high Mdot also explains why
very large grains (amax>1 micron) are frequently found in these shells, since
amax \propto Mdot. The statistics of these shells (numbers, ages, masses, and
grain properties such as amax) provide an archaeological record of this mass
loss process. In particular, the velocities v, transient durations (where
known) and ejected masses M of the Galactic shells and the supernova
""impostors"" proposed as their extragalactic counterparts are very different.
While much of the difference is a selection effect created by shell lifetimes
~1/(v sqrt(M)), more complete Galactic and extragalactic surveys are needed to
demonstrate that the two phenomena share a common origin given that their
observed properties are essentially disjoint. If even small fractions (1%) of
SNe show interactions with such dense shells of ejecta, as is currently
believed, then the driving mechanism of the eruptions must be associated with
the very final phases of stellar evolution, suggestive of some underlying
nuclear burning instability.

the Balmer emission lines due to the presence of strong metal and Balmer
absorption features in the stellar continuum. This accurate measurement is
necessary for use in emission line diagnostics, such as the Balmer decrement
(i.e. Halpha/Hbeta), used to determine the attenuation of galaxies. Yet at high
redshifts obtaining such spectra becomes costly. Balmer emission line
equivalent widths are much easier to measure, requiring only low resolution
spectra or even simple narrow band filters and therefore shorter observation
times. However a correction for the stellar continuum is still needed for this
equivalent width Balmer decrement. We present here a statistical analysis of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 emission line galaxy sample, using
the spectrally determined Balmer emission line fluxes and equivalent widths.
Using the large numbers of galaxies available in the SDSS catalogue, we
determined an equivalent width Balmer decrement including a statistically-based
correction for the stellar continuum. Based on this formula, the attenuation of
galaxies can now be obtained from low spectral resolution observations. In
addition, this investigation also revealed an error in the Hbeta line fluxes,
within the SDSS DR7 MPA/JHU catalogue, with the equivalent widths
underestimated by average ~0.35A in the emission line galaxy sample. This error
means that Balmer decrement determined attenuations are overestimated by a
systematic 0.1 magnitudes in A_V, and future analyses of this sample need to
include this correction.

Surprisingly the multi-cut boundary-condition recursion equations have a

independently developed semi-analytic models for galaxy formation and
evolution. In our models, both the number of cluster members and that of
elliptical members increase as a function of cluster mass, in such a way that
the resulting elliptical fractions are approximately independent of cluster
mass. The population of cluster ellipticals exhibit a marked bimodal
distribution as a function of galaxy stellar mass, with a dip at masses $\sim
10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. In the framework of our models, this bimodality
originates from the combination of a strongly decreasing number of galaxies
with increasing stellar mass, and a correspondingly increasing probability of
experiencing major mergers. We show that the correlation between the measured
elliptical fraction and the assembly history of the parent cluster is weak, and
that it becomes stronger in models that adopt longer galaxy merger times. We
argue that this results from the combined effect of a decreasing bulge
production due to a reduced number of mergers, and an increasing survival
probability of pre-existing ellipticals, with the latter process being more
important than the former.

explicitly integrate the dynamical equations up to any order of the expansion,
then restrict the integration constants by imposing the momentum constraint.
While the gradient expansion relies on the long wavelength approximation,
amplitudes of perturbations do not have to be small. When the $\lambda\to 1$
limit is taken, the obtained nonlinear solutions exhibit a continuous behavior
at any order of the gradient expansion, recovering general relativity in the
presence of a scalar field and the ""dark matter as an integration constant"".
This is in sharp contrast to the results in the literature based on the
""standard"" (and naive) perturbative approach where in the same limit, the
perturbative expansion of the action breaks down and the scalar graviton mode
appears to be strongly coupled. We carry out a detailed analysis on the source
of these apparent pathologies and determine that they originate from an
improper application of the perturbative approximation in the momentum
constraint. We also show that there is a new branch of solutions, valid in the
regime where $|\lambda-1|$ is smaller than the order of perturbations. In the
limit $\lambda\to1$, this new branch allows the theory to be continuously
connected to general relativity (plus ""dark matter"").

the network performance of these systems has become a very important issue in
the design and realization of these networks. Hence, the performance of the P2P

improvement of the P2P systems: Method-1: Improve the P2P routing by using a
sandwich technique. Method-2: Improve the search performance by introducing a
new search based on the super peer. Method-3: Improving the search by
introducing a ranking algorithm based on the knowledge database. The system
demonstrates that the methods introduced here have the improved efficiency

occur slowly over a relatively long, 10 Myr, timescale. Gas accretion during
this stage, through a completely or partially opened gap in the solar nebula,
occurs slowly allowing for the condensation of ices, and incomplete
differentiation, seen in the regular satellites of the giant planets.
Furthermore, the dichotomy seen in the Jovian and Saturnian systems may be
explained as this infall wanes or is completely shutoff as a result of gap
opening or global depletion of gas in the solar nebula. We present
one-dimensional simulations of circumplanetary disks that couple the viscous
transport of material with the loss of mass at the disk outer edge by
ultraviolet photoevaporation as well as the infall of material from the solar
nebula. We find that the circumplanetary disks of these protoplanets are
truncated, as a result of photoevaporation, at a range of values with the mean
corresponding to $\approx$ 0.16 Hill radii. These truncation radii are broadly
consistent with the current locations of the regular satellite systems of
Jupiter and Saturn. We also find that photoevaporation can successfully act as
a clearing mechanism for circumplanetary nebulae on the potentially short
timescales, 100-10,000 yr, over which mass accretion from the solar nebula
wanes as a result of gap opening. Such a rapid clearing of the circum-Jovian

that in the context of the theoretical arguments that have been generally used
in the literature, many young SNe, and especially those of Type IIn, which are
the brightest X-ray luminosity class, do not appear to be expanding into steady
winds. Some IIns appear to have very steep X-ray luminosity declines,
indicating density declines much steeper than r$^{-2}$. However, other IIns
show a constant or even increasing X-ray luminosity over periods of months to
years. Many other SNe do not appear to have declines consistent with expansion
in a steady wind. SNe with lower X-ray luminosities appear to be more
consistent with steady wind expansion, although the numbers are not large
enough to make firm statistical comments. The numbers do indicate that the
expansion and density structure of the circumstellar medium must be
investigated before assumptions can be made of steady wind expansion. Unless a
steady wind can be shown, mass-loss rates deduced using this assumption may

of states for both dots and the transmission (as well as linear and

Moreover, we observed that these modified Kondo resonances are very susceptible
to the change of the indirect coupling's strength. We have also shown that the
Kondo temperature become suppressed with increasing asymmetry in the dot-lead
couplings when there is no indirect coupling. Moreover, when the indirect
coupling is turned on the Kondo temperature becomes suppressed. By allowing a

the classical WKB perturbative analysis of tight-winding perturbations, the key
assumption being that the potential due to the density wave is approximately
radial. The above has served as a valuable guide in aiding the understanding of
both simulated and observed galaxies, in spite of a number of caveats being
present. The observed spiral or bar patterns in real galaxies are frequently
only marginally consistent with the tight-winding assumption, often in fact,
outright inconsistent. Here we derive a complementary formulation to the
problem, by treating quasi-radial density waves under simplified assumptions in
the linear regime. We assume that the potential due to the density wave is
approximately tangential, and derive the corresponding dispersion relation of
the problem. We obtain an instability criterion for the onset of quasi-radial
density waves, which allows a clear understanding of the increased stability of
the higher order modes, which appear at progressively larger radii, as often
seen in real galaxies. The theory naturally yields a range of pattern speeds
for these arms which appears constrained by the condition
$\Omega_{p}<\Omega_{0} \pm \kappa /m$. For the central regions of galaxies
where solid body rotation curves might apply, we find weak bars in the
oscillatory regime with various pattern speeds, including counter rotating
ones, and a prediction for $\Omega_{p}$ to increase towards the centre, as seen
in the rapidly rotating bars within bars of some numerical simulations. We
complement this study with detailed numerical simulations of galactic disks and
careful Fourier analysis of the emergent perturbations, which support the

to trace the radial surface brightness (SB) profile over a much larger range of
radii and surface brightness than is possible with either technique alone. The
exponential disc as traced by RGB stars dominates the SB profile out to >8 disc
scale-lengths, or R_dp~18 kpc, and reaches a V-band SB of 29 mag per sq.
arcsec. Beyond this radius, we find evidence for an extended structural
component with a significantly flatter SB profile than the inner disc and which

with a power-law index of ~3, has an axial ratio consistent with that of the

optimized for small memory footprint while maintaining efficient performance in

occupies 4 bytes (2 if deadlock detection is not required), and a condition
variable occupies 4 bytes. The corresponding primitives of the popular pthread

covering only the most common use cases. Lwlocks allow explicit control of
queuing and scheduling decisions in contention situations and support
""asynchronous"" or ""deferred blocking"" acquisition of locks. Asynchronous
locking helps in working around the constraints of lock-ordering which
otherwise limits concurrency. The small footprint of lwlocks enables the
construction of data structures with very fine-grained locking, which in turn
is crucial for lowering contention and supporting highly concurrent access to a
data structure. Currently, the Data Domain File System uses lwlocks for its
in-memory inode cache as well as in a generic doubly-linked concurrent list

answers to shortest-path and distance queries in graphs. The tradeoff between
the space requirements and the query time of distance oracles is of particular
interest and the main focus of this paper.
  In FOCS'01, Thorup introduced approximate distance oracles for planar graphs.
He proved that, for any eps>0 and for any planar graph on n nodes, there exists
a (1+eps)-approximate distance oracle using space O(n eps^{-1} log n) such that
approximate distance queries can be answered in time O(1/eps).
  Ten years later, we give the first improvements on the space-querytime
tradeoff for planar graphs.
  * We give the first oracle having a space-time product with subquadratic
dependency on 1/eps. For space ~O(n log n) we obtain query time ~O(1/eps)
(assuming polynomial edge weights). The space shows a doubly logarithmic
dependency on 1/eps only. We believe that the dependency on eps may be almost
optimal.
  * For the case of moderate edge weights (average bounded by polylog(n), which
appears to be the case for many real-world road networks), we hit a ""sweet
spot,"" improving upon Thorup's oracle both in terms of eps and n. Our oracle
uses space ~O(n log log n) and it has query time ~O(log log log n + 1/eps).

e.g.) to gain competitive superiority over native species. But expending
resources on interference presumably exacts a cost in another life-history
trait, so that the significance of interference competition for invasion
ecology remains uncertain. We model ecological invasion when combined effects
of preemptive and interference competition govern interactions at the
neighborhood scale. We consider three cases. Under ""novel weapons,"" only the
initially rare invader exercises interference. For ""resistance zones"" only the
resident species interferes, and finally we take both species as interference
competitors. Interference increases the other species' mortality, opening space
for colonization. However, a species exercising greater interference has
reduced propagation, which can hinder its colonization of open sites.
Interference never enhances a rare invader's growth in the homogeneously mixing
approximation to our model. But interference can significantly increase an
invader's competitiveness, and its growth when rare, if interactions are
structured spatially. That is, interference can increase an invader's success
when colonization of open sites depends on local, rather than global, species
densities. In contrast, interference enhances the common, resident species'
resistance to invasion independently of spatial structure, unless the
propagation-cost is too great. Increases in background mortality (i.e.,
mortality not due to interference) always reduce the effectiveness of
interference competition.

Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, we find that the critical value of the

evidence that the transition is in the O(3) universality class for all S. Using
bond operator mean field theory restricted to singlet and triplet states, we
find J_{\perp c}[S] ~ S(S+1), in qualitative accord with QMC, but the resulting
J_{\perp c} [S] is significantly smaller than the QMC value. For S=1/2,
incorporating triplet-triplet interactions within a variational approach yields
a critical interlayer coupling which agrees well with QMC. For higher spin, we
argue that it is crucial to account for the high energy quintet modes, and show
that including these within a perturbative scheme leads to reasonable agreement
with QMC results for S=1,3/2. We discuss the broad implications of our results

Laplace Equation (the electrostatic or Rayleigh limit) and by the Helmholtz
Equation (electrodynamic or Mie limit). We formulate the problem in terms of
the scalar potential, which simplifies calculations without introducing
approximations. Because scattering is not usually calculated this way, we
provide the necessary theoretical justification showing that the
scalar-potential description is complete. Additional simplifications result
from treating the scatterer as a point charge q instead of a dipole. This
allows us to determine the consequences of including the longitudinal (Coulomb)
interaction between q and a passive resonator. This interaction suppresses the
mathematical singularities that lead to the unphysical resonant infinities in
first and second enhancements. It also modifies the effective restoring-force
constant of a resonant denominator, which permits us to explore the possibility
of dual resonance through a molecular pathway. We apply the formalism to
spherical inclusions of radius a for q located at polar and equatorial
positions. For small a, of the order of 1 nm or less, the low-l multipole terms
are important. For the more relevant case of radii of the order of 10 nm and
larger, the q-sphere interaction can be approximated by a model where q
interacts with its image charge for a dielectric plane, and the singularity
shifts in a discrete manner from \epsilon(\omega)=-2 to \epsilon(\omega)=-1.
These results are supported by more accurate calculations taking retardation
into account, although the use of only one spherical-harmonic term does not
fully represent the difference between forward- and backscattering.

operator into the overlap formula to construct the overlap hypercube operator.
This is an exact solution to the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, with an excellent
level of locality and scaling. Due to its similarity with the hypercubic
kernel, a low polynomial in this kernel provides a numerically efficient Hybrid
Monte Carlo force. We measure the microscopic Dirac spectrum and discuss the
corresponding scale-invariant parameter, which takes a surprising form. This is
an interesting case, since Random Matrix Theory is unexplored for this setting,
where the chiral condensate {\Sigma} vanishes in the chiral limit. We also
measure {\Sigma} and the ""pion"" mass, in distinct topological sectors. In this
context we discuss and probe the topological summation of observables by
various methods, as well as the evaluation of the topological susceptibility.
The feasibility of this summation is essential for the prospects of dynamical
overlap fermions in QCD.

exerts spatiotemporal control of the somitic patterning has required a
combination of experimental and mathematical modeling strategies. Significant
progress has been made for the zebrafish clockwork. However, due to its
complexity, the clockwork of the amniote segmentation regulatory network has
not been fully elucidated. Here, we address the question of how oscillations
are arrested in the amniote segmentation clock. We do this by constructing a
minimal model of the regulatory network, which privileges architectural
information over molecular details. With a suitable choice of parameters, our
model is able to reproduce the oscillatory behavior of the Wnt, Notch and FGF
signaling pathways in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells. By introducing
positional information via a single Wnt3a gradient, we show that oscillations
are arrested following an infinite-period bifurcation. Notably: the
oscillations increase their amplitude as cells approach the anterior PSM and
remain in an upregulated state when arrested; the transition from the
oscillatory regime to the upregulated state exhibits hysteresis; and an
opposing distribution of the Fgf8 and RA gradients in the PSM arises naturally
in our simulations. We hypothesize that the interaction between a limit cycle
(originated by the Notch delayed-negative feedback loop) and a bistable switch
(originated by the Wnt-Notch positive cross-regulation) is responsible for the
observed segmentation patterning. Our results agree with previously unexplained
experimental observations and suggest a simple plausible mechanism for
spatiotemporal control of somitogenesis in amniotes.

planets may arise on planets with strong day-night surface temperature
contrasts. Earth-like habitable-zone (HZ) planets maintain stable surface
liquid water over geological time. This requires equilibrium between the
temperature-dependent rate of greenhouse-gas consumption by weathering,and
greenhouse-gas resupply by other processes. Detected small-radius exoplanets,
and anticipated M-dwarf HZ rocky planets, are expected to be tidally locked. We
investigate two feedbacks that can destabilize climate on tidally-locked
planets. (1) If small changes in pressure alter the temperature distribution
across a planet's surface such that the weathering rate increases when the
pressure decreases, a positive feedback occurs involving increasing weathering
rate near the substellar point, decreasing pressure, and increasing substellar
surface temperature. (2) When decreases in pressure increase the surface area
above the melting point (through reduced advective cooling of the substellar
point), and the corresponding increase in volume of liquid causes net
dissolution of the atmosphere, a further decrease in pressure occurs. We use an
idealized energy balance model to map out the conditions under which these
instabilities may occur. The weathering runaway can shrink the habitable zone,
and cause geologically rapid 10^3-fold pressure shifts within the HZ. Mars may
have undergone a weathering runaway in the past. Substellar dissolution is
usually a negative feedback or weak positive feedback on changes in pressure.
Both instabilities are suppressed if the atmosphere has a high radiative
efficiency. Our results are most relevant for atmospheres that are thin and
have low greenhouse-gas radiative efficiency. These results identify a new
pathway by which HZ planets can undergo rapid climate shifts and become
uninhabitable.

is zero. The different multi-electron states are expressed in terms of Wilson
states. The use of N Wilson states simulates the use of a large effective
number N_{eff} of states. A plot of ln(F) versus N\proptoln(N_{eff}) reveals
whether one has an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe at zero energy. The
results are at first glance surprising. The ln(F)-ln(N_{eff}) plot for the
Kondo impurity diverges for large N_{eff}. On the other hand, the corresponding
plot for the symmetric FA impurity saturates for large N_{eff} when the level
spacing at the Fermi level is of the order of the singlet-triplet excitation
energy. The behavior of the fidelity allows one to determine the phase shift of
the electron states in this regime. PACS: 75.20.Hr, 71.23.An, 71.27.+a,

cosmological N-body simulations of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, we
quantify the impact of a simulated halo's mass accretion and merging history on
two commonly used measures of its dynamical state, the virial ratio eta and the
centre of mass offset Delta r. Quantifying this relationship is important
because the degree to which a halo is dynamically equilibrated will influence
the reliability with which we can measure characteristic equilibrium properties
of the structure and kinematics of a population of haloes. We begin by
verifying that a halo's formation redshift zform correlates with its virial
mass Mvir and we show that the fraction of its recently accreted mass and the
likelihood of it having experienced a recent major merger increases with
increasing Mvir and decreasing zform. We then show that both eta and Delta r
increase with increasing Mvir and decreasing zform, which implies that massive
recently formed haloes are more likely to be dynamically unrelaxed than their
less massive and older counterparts. Our analysis shows that both eta and Delta
r are good indicators of a halo's dynamical state, showing strong positive
correlations with recent mass accretion and merging activity, but we argue that
Delta r provides a more robust and better defined measure of dynamical state
for use in cosmological N-body simulations at z~0. We find that Delta r < 0.04
is sufficient to pick out dynamically relaxed haloes at z=0. Finally, we assess
our results in the context of previous studies, and consider their
observational implications.

that is not possible to reconstruct the genealogical history of each species
along all its generations by means of a geometric progression. This analysis
demonstrates that it is possible to rebuild the tree of progenitors by modeling
the problem with a Markov chain. For each generation, the maximum number of
possible ancestors is different. This brings huge problems for the resolution.
We found a solution through a dilation of the sample space, although the
distribution defined there takes smaller values respect to the initial problem.
In order to correct the distribution for each generation, we introduced the
invariance under gauge (local) group of dilations. These ideas can used to
study the interaction of several processes and provide a new approach on the
problem of the common ancestor. In the same direction, this model also provide
some elements that can be used to improve models of animal reproduction.

environment. The presence of the environment often gives rise to a Markovian
process in which the system loses information to its surroundings. However,
many quantum systems exhibit a pronounced non-Markovian behavior in which there
is a flow of information from the environment back to the system, signifying
the presence of quantum memory effects [1-5]. The environment is usually
composed of a large number of degrees of freedom which are difficult to

for the generation of entangled states [7-9], for schemes of dissipative

environmental states to drive the open system from the Markovian to the
non-Markovian regime, to control the information flow between the system and
the environment, and to determine the degree of non-Markovianity by direct

orbitals together with the Ba-5d and As-4p states (ddp-model) and compare these
results with a downfolded model that consists of Fe/Mn d-states only (d-model).
Electronic correlations are treated using the multiband Gutzwiller

LDA+Gutzwiller method with electron density self-consistency. The
renormalization factors for the correlated Mn 3d orbitals in the paramagnetic
phase of BaMn_{2}As_{2} are shown to be generally smaller than those of
BaFe_{2}As_{2}, which indicates that BaMn_{2}As_{2} has stronger electron
correlation effect than BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The screening effect of the main As 4p
electrons to the correlated Fe/Mn 3d electrons is evident by the systematic
shift of the results to larger Hund's rule coupling J side from the ddp-model

state to the antiferromagnetic ground state with increasing J is obtained for
the models of BaFe_{2}As_{2} which has a small experimental magnetic moment;

d-electrons per Mn atom, is for same values of the electron correlations closer

the strong electromagnetic radiation field and/or electron-positron pair plasma

predict the amplitude of the upcoming solar cycle. In the recent past this
method has been subjected to severe criticism. In this communication we show
that this simple method is reliable and can profitably be used for prediction
purposes. With the 13-month smoothed R$_{min}$ of 1.8 at the beginning, it is
predicted that the R$_{max}$ of the ongoing cycle will be around 85$\pm$17,
suggesting that Cycle 24 may be of moderate strength. Based on a second order
polynomial dependence between the rise time (T$_R$) and R$_{max}$, it is
predicted that Cycle 24 will reach its smoothed maximum amplitude during the
third quarter of the year 2013. An important finding of this paper is that the
rise time cycle amplitude relation reaches a minimum at about 3 to 3.5 years
corresponding to a cycle amplitude of about 160. The Waldmeier effect breaks at
this point and T$_{R}$ increases further with increase in R$_{max}$. This
feature, we believe, may put a constraint on the flux transport dynamo models
and lead to more accurate physical principles based predictions.

associated with a molecular cloud. Interstellar photons are seen to play an
important role towards the growth and the structure of the interstellar grain

notice that the effects of interstellar photons dominate around the region of
lower visual extinction. These photons contribute significantly in the
formation of the grain mantle. Energy of the incoming photon is attenuated by
the absorption and scattering by the interstellar dust. Top most layers are
mainly assumed to be affected by the incoming radiation. We have studied the
effects of photo-dissociation by varying the number of layers which could be
affected by it. Model calculations are carried out for the static (extinction
parameter is changing with the density of the cloud) as well as the time
dependent case (i.e., extinction parameter and number density of the cloud both
are changing with time) and the results are discussed in details. Different
routes to the formation of water molecules are studied and it is noticed that
around the dense region, production of water molecules via O$_3$ and H$_2$O$_2$

family. It shows all properties that are typical for these stars (the light

except for one: it lacks any signatures of youth. With the Li I line, as a
rough estimate for the stellar age, we show that the ""lithium"" age of RZ Psc
lies between the age of stars in the Pleiades (approximately 70 Myr) and the
Orion (approximately 10 Myr) clusters. We also roughly estimated the age of RZ
Psc based on the proper motion of the star using the Tycho-2 catalog. We found
that the star has escaped from its assumed birthplace near to the Galactic
plane about 30-40 Myr ago. We conclude that RZ Psc is a post-UXOr star, and its
sporadic eclipses are caused by material from the debris disk.

obtaining three-dimensional maps of various physical quantities in the solar

prove intractable because of computational constraints. Due to the enormous
seismic data sets that already exist and those forthcoming, this is a problem
that needs to be addressed. To this end, we present a very efficient linear
inversion algorithm for local helioseismology. It is based on a subtractive
optimally localized averaging (SOLA) scheme in the Fourier domain, utilizing
the horizontal-translation invariance of the sensitivity kernels. In Fourier
space the problem decouples into many small problems, one for each horizontal
wave vector. This multi-channel SOLA method is demonstrated for an example
problem in time-distance helioseismology that is small enough to be solved both
in real and Fourier space. We find that both approaches are successful in
solving the inverse problem. However, the multi-channel SOLA algorithm is much
faster and can easily be parallelized.

evolution of intermediate mass single stars predict most of the observations of
the different populations in globular clusters although some important issues
still need to be further clarified. In particular, to reproduce the observed
anticorrelations of Na-O and Al-Mg, chemically enriched gas lost during the AGB
phase of intermediate mass single stars must be mixed with matter with a
pristine chemical composition. The source of this matter is still a matter of
debate. Furthermore, observations reveal that a significant fraction of the
intermediate mass and massive stars are born as components of close binaries.
  Aims. We will investigate the effects of binaries on the chemical evolution
of Globular Clusters and on the origin of matter with a pristine chemical
composition that is needed for the single star AGB scenario to work
  Methods. We use a population synthesis code that accounts for binary physics
in order to estimate the amount and the composition of the matter returned to
the interstellar medium of a population of binaries.
  Results. We demonstrate in the present paper that the mass lost by a
significant population of intermediate mass close binaries in combination with
the single star AGB pollution scenario may help to explain the chemical
properties of the different populations of stars in Globular Clusters.

of this system as the size of the population grows to infinity. Under
indistinguishability per type assumption, we show that under any Markov

ellipticity and constrain the intrinsic shape and orientation of the cluster.
We apply the method to the rich cluster Abell 1689, which was targeted by the
Chandra and XMM satellites as well as by several SZe observatories.
Observations cover in detail a region <~ 1 Mpc. Our analysis favours a mildly
triaxial cluster with a minor to major axis ratio of 0.70+-0.15, preferentially
elongated along the line of sight, as expected for massive lensing clusters.
The triaxial structure together with the orientation bias can reconcile X-ray
with lensing analyses and supports the view of A1689 as a just slightly
over-concentrated massive cluster not so far from hydrostatic equilibrium.

Hence they are key objects for investigating A and F type stars with
asteroseismic techniques. An important requirement for seismic modeling are
small errors in temperature, gravity and chemical composition. Furthermore, we
want to investigate the existence of an abundance indicator typical for
hybrids, something that is well established for the roAp stars. Previous to the
present investigation, the abundance pattern of only one hybrid and another
hybrid candidate has been published. We obtained high-resolution spectra of HD
114839 and BD +18 4914 using the SOPHIE spectrograph of the Observatoire de
Haute-Provence and the HARPS spectrograph at ESO La Silla. For each star we
determined fundamental parameters and photospheric abundances of 16 chemical
elements by comparing synthetic spectra with the observations. We compare our
results to that of seven delta Sct and nine gamma Dor stars. For the evolved BD
+18 4914 we found an abundance pattern typical for an Am star, but could not
confirm this peculiarity for the less evolved star HD 114839, which is
classified in the literature as uncertain Am star. Our result supports the
concept of evolved Am stars being unstable. With our investigation we nearly
doubled the number of spectroscopically analyzed delta Sct - gamma Dor hybrid
stars, but did not yet succeed in identifying a spectroscopic signature for
this group of pulsating stars. A statistically significant spectroscopic
investigation of delta Sct - gamma Dor hybrid stars still is missing, but would

that is located on the blue border of the classical instability strip. While we
mostly observe low radial order modes in classical delta Scuti stars, HD 144277
presents a different case. Its high observed frequencies, i.e., between 59.9c/d
(693.9 microHz) and 71.1c/d (822.8microHz), suggest higher radial orders. We
examine the progression of the regular frequency spacings from the low radial
order to the asymptotic frequency region. Frequency analysis was performed
using Period04 and SigSpec. The results from the MOST observing runs in 2009
and 2010 were compared to each other. The resulting frequencies were submitted
to asteroseismic analysis. HD 144277 was discovered to be a delta Scuti star
using the time-series photometry observed by the MOST satellite. Twelve
independent pulsation frequencies lying in four distinct groups were
identified. Two additional frequencies were found to be combination
frequencies. The typical spacing of 3.6c/d corresponds to the spacing between
subsequent radial and dipole modes, therefore the spacing between radial modes
is twice this value, 7.2c/d. Based on the assumption of slow rotation, we find
evidence that the two radial modes are the sixth and seventh overtones, and the
frequency with the highest amplitude can be identified as a dipole mode. The
models required to fit the observed instability range need slightly less
metallicity and a moderate enhancement of the helium abundance compared to the
standard chemical composition. Our asteroseismic models suggest that HD 144277
is a delta Scuti star close to the ZAMS with a mass of 1.66 solar masses.

other colours in the optical and near-infrared, we find that the colours become
bluer for larger galaxies. The relations are tighter when using the colour
inside r_e, rather than the much smaller r_e/8 aperture, due to the presence of
young populations in the central regions. We also obtain strong correlations
between the [3.6]-[4.5] colour and 3 strong absorption lines (H beta, Mg b and

more metal rich galaxies are bluer, we can explain our results in a way
consistent with results from the optical, by stating that larger galaxies are
more metal rich. The blueing is caused by a strong CO absorption band, whose
line strength increases strongly with decreasing temperature and which covers a
considerable fraction of the 4.5 micron filter. In galaxies that contain a
compact radio source, the [3.6]-[4.5] colour is generally slightly redder than

the Roebel cable and design the cryogenic system. In this article, we simulate
and discuss the AC loss due to an applied magnetic field making an arbitrary
angle with the cable and taking into account a realistic anisotropic field
dependence of the critical current density. We study the AC loss in the
superconductor parts for the limits of very high coupling currents and
completely uncoupled strands. The simulations for the uncoupled case also
describe a double pancake coil with no transport current. For the simulations,
we use two different numerical methods with complementary strengths. This
serves as a mutual check of the correctness of the simulation results, which
agree to each other. Opposite than expected, we found that the AC loss does not
only depend on the perpendicular component of the applied magnetic field. We
also found that the AC loss for applied fields with an orientation below 7
degrees with the strands surface is reduced more than one order of magnitude

cables for windings with important parallel components of the magnetic field,

the inverse problem in a class which is larger than $L^\infty$. Also, we give
new counterexamples for the uniqueness of the inverse conductivity problem.
  We say that a conductivity is visible if the inverse problem is solvable so
that the inside of the domain can be uniquely determined, up to a change of
coordinates, using the boundary measurements. The present counterexamples for
the inverse problem have been related to the invisibility cloaking. This means
that there are conductivities for which a part of the domain is shielded from
detection via boundary measurements. Such conductivities are called
invisibility cloaks.
  In the present paper we identify the borderline of the visible conductivities
and the borderline of invisibility cloaking conductivities. Surprisingly, these
borderlines are not the same. We show that between the visible and the cloaking
conductivities there are the electric holograms, conductivities which create an

motivated a number of different organizations of Boolean optimizers since the
mid 90s. Some of the most successful approaches are based on iterative calls to
an NP oracle, using either linear search, binary search or the identification
of unsatisfiable sub-formulas. The increasing use of Boolean optimizers in
practical settings raises the question of confidence in computed results. For
example, the issue of confidence is paramount in safety critical settings. One
way of increasing the confidence of the results computed by Boolean optimizers
is to develop techniques for validating the results. Recent work studied the
validation of Boolean optimizers based on branch-and-bound search. This paper
complements existing work, and develops methods for validating Boolean
optimizers that are based on iterative calls to an NP oracle. This entails
implementing solutions for validating both satisfiable and unsatisfiable
answers from the NP oracle. The work described in this paper can be applied to
a wide range of Boolean optimizers, that find application in Pseudo-Boolean
Optimization and in Maximum Satisfiability. Preliminary experimental results
indicate that the impact of the proposed method in overall performance is
negligible.

recently from Herschel and Planck show that dust emission is not well
understood, as revealed by the observed anti-correlation of beta with the grain
temperature. In order to give astronomers the necessary data to interpret
FIR/submm observations, we synthesised analogues of interstellar amorphous and
crystalline silicate grains, rich in Mg and Ca, and having stiochiometry of
olivine and pyroxene and measured their MAC, in the 100-1000/1500 \mum range
for grain temperatures varying from 300 to 10 K. We find that the grain MAC
decreases when the grain temperature decreases and that the local spectral
index, beta, defined as the slope of the MAC curve, is anti-correlated with the
grain temperature. These variations, which are not observed in the crystallised
samples, are related to the amorphous nature of the samples. In addition, the
spectral shape of the MAC is complex: at short wavelengths (lambda < 500/700
\mum), beta is in the range 1.6 - 2.1 for all grain temperature and grain
composition whereas at longer wavelengths (lambda > 500/700 \mum), beta < 2 for
samples with a pyroxene stoichiometry and beta > 2 for samples with an olivine
stoichiometry. Hence, the simplifying asymptotic expression based on a single
temperature- and wavelength-independent spectral index used by astronomers is
not appropriate to describe the dust MAC and thus the dust emission, and may
induce significant errors on the derived parameters such as the dust mass and
the dust physical and chemical properties. Instead, dust emission models should
use the dust MAC as a function of wavelength and temperature.

This opens a new field in exoplanet science: the possibility to get information

In this letter, we apply the Lava-ocean model to interpret the observed phase
curve. The model, a planet with no atmosphere and a surface partially made of
molten rocks, has been proposed for planets of the class of CoRoT-7b, i.e.
rocky planets very close to their star (at few stellar radii). Kepler-10b is a
typical member of this family. It predicts that the light from the planet has
an important emission component in addition to the reflected one, even in the
Kepler spectral band. Assuming an isotropical reflection of light by the
planetary surface (Lambertian-like approximation), we find that a Bond albedo
of \sim50% can account for the observed amplitude of the phase curve, as
opposed to a first attempt where an unusually high value was found. We propose
a physical process to explain this still large value of the albedo. The overall
interpretation can be tested in the future with instruments as JWST or EChO.
Our model predicts a spectral dependence that is clearly distinguishable from
that of purely reflected light, and from that of a planet at a uniform
temperature.

a focused Gaussian beam may easily be envisaged as the action of a
phase-modifying element, i.e. a lens: Rays traversing the inhomogeneous
refractive index field n(r) collect an additional phase along their trajectory
which advances or retards their phase with respect to the unperturbed ray. This
lens-like action has long been understood as being the mechanism behind the
signal of thin sample photothermal absorption measurements [1, 2], where a
cylindrical symmetry and a different lengthscale is present. In photothermal
single (nano-)particle microscopy, however, a complicated, though
prediction-wise limited, electrodynamic (EM) scattering treatment was
established [3] during the emergence of this new technique. Our recent study
extended [4] this EM-approach into a full ab-initio model describing the
reality of the situation encountered and showed for the first time that the
mechanism behind the signal, despite its nanoscopic origin, is also the
lens-like action of the induced refractive index profile only hidden in the
complicated guise of the theoretical Mie-like framework. The diffraction model
proposed here yields succinct analytical expressions for the axial PT signal
shape and magnitude and its angular distribution, all showing the clear
lens-signature. It is further demonstrated, that the Gouy-phase of a Gaussian
beam does not contribute to the relative photothermal signal in forward
direction, a fact which is not easily evident from the more rigorous EM
treatment. The model may thus be used to estimate the signal shape and
magnitude in photothermal single particle microscopy.

lattice structures. Manipulating valley degeneracy is the subject matter of an
emerging field of investigation, mostly focused on charge transport in

degeneracy and a Dirac dispersion in each valley. Here we show that because of
their huge in-plane mass anisotropy, a flow of Dirac electrons along the
trigonal axis is extremely sensitive to the orientation of in-plane magnetic
field. Thus, a rotatable magnetic field can be used as a valley valve to tune
the contribution of each valley to the total conductivity. According to our
measurements, charge conductivity by carriers of a single valley can exceed
four-fifth of the total conductivity in a wide range of temperature and
magnetic field. At high temperature and low magnetic field, the three valleys
are interchangeable and the three-fold symmetry of the underlying lattice is
respected. As the temperature lowers and/or the magnetic field increases, this
symmetry is spontaneously lost. The latter may be an experimental manifestation
of the recently proposed valley-nematic Fermi liquid state.

zero density of state at the Dirac point. In contrast, for a strong amplitude

in a transition of the tunnel magnetoresistance from a broad peak to a sharp

we show that even the graph's components and their interactions are not
determined by input/output behavior. From these results, we conclude that
without further assumptions, very few aspects, if any, of a system's structure
are determined by its input/output relation. We consider a number of such

characterize when two systems have the same structure. Second, in many

these cases, we can assume that a certain variable x does not influence another

broadcast channel where a sender transmits two independent messages to two
receivers. A constraint that each message must be kept confidential from the
unintended receiver constitutes the second class. For both classes, the
conditional distribution characterizing the channel depends on a state process
and the encoder has side-information provided to it in a noncausal manner. For
the first class of channels, an outer bound is derived employing techniques
used to prove the converse theorem for the Gel'fand-Pinsker's channel with
random parameters; the bounds are tight for individual rate constraints, but
can be improved upon for the sum rate. The technique for deriving outer bounds
for the second class of channels hinges on the confidentiality requirements; we
also derive a genie-aided outer bound, where a hypothetical genie gives the
unintended message to a receiver which treats it as side-information during
equivocation computation. For both classes of channels, Csisz\'{a}r's sum
identity plays a central role in establishing the capacity outer bounds.

observed black hole - bulge relations and its evolution with redshift. We
provide a common framework in which all kinds of selection effects on the
BH-bulge relations can be investigated, but our main emphasis is on the
consequences of using broad-line AGN and their host galaxies to search for
evolution in the BH-bulge relation. We identified relevant sources of bias that
were not discussed in the literature so far. A particularly important effect is
caused by the fact that the active fraction among SMBHs varies considerably
with BH mass, in the sense that high-mass BHs are less likely to be active than
lower mass ones. In the connection with intrinsic scatter of the BH-bulge
relation this effect implies a bias towards a low BH mass at given bulge
property. This effect adds to the bias caused by working with luminosity or
flux limited samples that were already discussed by others. A quantitative
prediction of these biases requires (i) a realistic model of the sample
selection function, and (ii) knowledge of relevant underlying distribution
functions. For low-redshift AGN samples we can naturally reproduce the
flattening of the relation observed in some studies. When extending our
analysis to higher redshift samples we are clearly hampered by limited
empirical constraints on the various relevant distribution functions. Using a
best-guess approach for these distributions we estimate the expected magnitude
of sample selection biases for a number of recent observational attempts to
study the BH-bulge evolution. In no case do we find statistically significant
evidence for an evolving BH-bulge relation. We suggest a possible practical
approach to circumvent several of the most problematic issues connected with
AGN selection; this could become a powerful diagnostic in future investigations

taking full advantage of the spatial-temporal coding power of the spiking

used to describe and train a synapse, three bits for the weights and three bits

algorithm is tested on the XOR classification problem where it produces better
results for even smaller network architectures than the proposed ones.
Furthermore, the algorithm is benchmarked on the Fisher iris classification
problem where it produces higher classification accuracies compared to

D_{L}(L)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{A}(z)=1$, where $D_{A}(z)$ and $D_{L}(z)$ are the angular
and luminosity distances, respectively. Using the general expression for X-ray
gas mass fraction ($f_{gas}$) of galaxy clusters, $f_{gas} \propto
D_L{D_A}^{1/2}$, we show that $f_{gas}$ observations jointly with type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) data furnish a validity test for the CDDR. To perform our
analysis we use 38 $f_{gas}$ measurements recently studied by two groups
considering different assumptions to describe the clusters (La Roque {\it{et
al.}} 2006 and Ettori {\it{et al.}} 2009) and two subsamples of SNe Ia distance
luminosity extracted from the Union2 compilation. In our test we consider the
$\eta$ parameter as a function of the redshift parameterized by two different
functional forms. It is found that the La Roque {\it{et al.}} (2006) sample is
in perfect agreement with the duality relation ($\eta = 1$) whereas the Ettori
{\it{et al.}} (2009) sample presents a significant conflict.

elaborate on our criticism of the recent claim that entropic gravity fails to
explain observations involving gravitationally-bound quantum states of neutrons
in the GRANIT experiment and gravitationally induced quantum interference. We
argue that the analysis leading to this claim is troubled by a
misinterpretation concerning the relation between the microstates of a
holographic screen and the state of a particle in the emergent space,
engendering inconsistencies. A point of view that could resolve the
inconsistencies is presented. We expound the general idea of the aforementioned
critical analysis of entropic gravity in such a consistent setting. This
enables us to clarify the problem and to identify a premise whose validity will
decide the faith of the criticism against entropic gravity. It is argued that
in order to reach a sensible conclusion we need more detailed knowledge on
entropic gravity. These arguments are relevant to any theory of emergent space,
where the entropy of the microscopic system depends on the distribution of
matter in the emergent space.

has been the subject of much debate, with single stars believed to be incapable
of producing the most highly collimated morphologies. However, observational
support for binary-induced shaping has been sadly lacking. Here, we highlight
the results of a continuing programme to spatio-kinematically model the
morphologies of all PNe known to contain a close binary central star.
Spatio-kinematical modelling is imperative for these objects, as it circumvents
the degeneracy between morphology and orientation which can adversely affect
determinations of morphology based on imaging alone. Furthermore,
spatio-kinematical modelling accurately determines the orientation of the
nebular shell, allowing the theoretically predicted perpendicular alignment,
between nebular symmetry axis and binary orbital plane, to be tested. To date,
every PN subjected to this investigation has displayed the predicted alignment,
indicating that binarity has played an important role in the formation and
evolution of these nebulae. The further results from this programme will be
key, not only in determining whether binary interaction is responsible for
shaping the studied PNe, but also in assessing the importance of binarity in
the formation and evolution of all PNe in general.

the time-resolved SED shows that the break is very smooth with a sharpness
index of 2.2 +- 0.2, and evolves towards lower frequencies as a power-law with
index -1.23 +- 0.06. These are the first accurate and contemporaneous
measurements of both the sharpness of the spectral break and its time
evolution. The measured evolution of the cooling break (nu_c propto t^-1.2) is
not consistent with the predictions of the standard model, wherein nu_c propto
t^-0.5 is expected. A possible explanation for the observed behavior is a time
dependence of the microphysical parameters, in particular the fraction of the
total energy in the magnetic field epsilon_B. This conclusion provides further
evidence that the standard fireball model is too simplistic, and time-dependent
micro-physical parameters may be required to model the growing number of
well-sampled afterglow light curves.

useful for providing an understanding at a conceptual level. An important
aspect of such models is the presence of a number of feedback loops that
feature considerable delay times, usually due to the time it takes to transport
energy (for example, in the form of hot/cold air or water) around the globe. In
this paper we demonstrate how one can perform a bifurcation analysis of the
behaviour of a periodically-forced system with delay in dependence on key
parameters. As an example we consider the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
which is a sea surface temperature oscillation on a multi-year scale in the
basin of the Pacific Ocean. One can think of ENSO as being generated by an
interplay between two feedback effects, one positive and one negative, which
act only after some delay that is determined by the speed of transport of
sea-surface temperature anomalies across the Pacific. We perform here a case
study of a simple delayed-feedback oscillator model for ENSO (introduced by
Tziperman et al, J. Climate 11 (1998)), which is parametrically forced by
annual variation. More specifically, we use numerical bifurcation analysis
tools to explore directly regions of delay-induced resonances and other
stability boundaries in this delay-differential equation model for ENSO.

long-lived fields that may have dominated the Universe at early times and then
decayed. Their decay, which injects entropy in the thermal bath, is responsible
for a second reheating, dubbed re-reheating, that could substantially dilute
the matter-antimatter asymmetry created before. In this paper we analyze such
late re-reheating and entropy dilution. It turns out that in some cases the
usual analytic calculation badly fails if it is not rectified by some
corrective factors that we provide. We also determine the parameter space where
the entropy dilution compromises models of baryogenesis. This region can be
obtained by imposing some generic constraints that are applicable to any
baryogenesis mechanism and long-lived field satisfying a few assumptions. For
instance, by applying them to MSSM electroweak baryogenesis, thermal
non-resonant leptogenesis and thermal resonant leptogenesis, we obtain that the
initial abundances of long-lived fields with lifetime longer than respectively
5*10^13, 10^-2 and 10^15 GeV^-1 are strongly constrained. Similarly, the same
baryogenesis scenarios are incompatible with large oscillations of moduli with

with prescribed symmetry should satisfy similar clustering properties. Finally,
we conjecture that the elements of {\mathcal I}^{(k,2)}_N provide a basis for
the subspace of symmetric superpolynomials in N variables that vanish when k+1
commuting variables are set equal to each other.

equation u_t=Lu(t,x)+\sigma(u(t,x))W on a torus with a periodic boundary

matter distributions in clusters of galaxies with spherical symmetry. It is
assumed that the dark matter density follows a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW)
profile and that the gas pressure is described by a generalised NFW (GNFW)
profile. By further demanding hydrostatic equilibrium and that the gas fraction
is small throughout the cluster, one obtains unique functional forms, dependent
on basic cluster parameters, for the radial profiles of all the properties of
interest in the cluster. We show these profiles are consistent both with
numerical simulations and multi-wavelength observations of clusters. We also
use our model to analyse six simulated SZ clusters as well as A611 SZ data from
the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI). In each case, we derive the radial
profile of the enclosed total mass and the gas pressure and show that the
results are in good agreement with our model prediction.

local, non-monotonic switching of the lattice structure, a phenomenon that is
not seen in the electronic insulator-to-metal transition mapped by near-field
infrared microscopy.
