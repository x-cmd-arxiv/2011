super-luminal speed with observed Supernova SN1987A neutrino burst and all (or
most) neutrino flavor oscillation. We considered three main frame-works: (1) A
tachyon imaginary neutrino mass, whose timing is nevertheless in conflict with
observed IMB-Kamiokande SN1987A burst by thousands of billion times longer. (2)
An ad hoc anti-tachyon model whose timing shrinkage may accommodate SN1987A
burst but greatly disagree with energy independent Cern-Opera super-luminal
speed. (3) A split neutrino flavor speed (among a common real mass relativistic
neutrino electron component and a super-luminal neutrino {\mu}) in an ad hoc
frozen speed scenario that is leading to the prompt neutrino de-coherence and
the rapid flavor mixing (between electron and muon ones) that are in conflict
with most oscillation records. Therefore we concluded that an error must be
hidden in Opera-Cern time calibration (as indeed recent rumors seem to
confirm). We are also reminding the relevance of the guaranteed minimal
atmospheric neutrino mass whose detection may be achieved by a milliseconds
graviton-neutrino split time delay among gravity burst and neutronization

Higher-order relations among tagged documents and images are major and
ubiquitous characteristics, and play positive roles in extracting reliable and
interpretable topics. In this paper, we propose the tag-topic models (TTM) to
depict such higher-order topic structural dependencies within the Markov random
field (MRF) framework. First, we use the novel factor graph representation of
latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic models from the MRF perspective,
and present an efficient loopy belief propagation (BP) algorithm for
approximate inference and parameter estimation. Second, we propose the factor
hypergraph representation of TTM, and focus on both pairwise and higher-order
relation modeling among tagged documents and images. Efficient loopy BP
algorithm is developed to learn TTM, which encourages the topic labeling
smoothness among tagged documents and images. Extensive experimental results
confirm the incorporation of higher-order relations to be effective in
enhancing the overall topic modeling performance, when compared with current
state-of-the-art topic models, in many text and image mining tasks of broad
interests such as word and link prediction, document classification, and tag

the input-output relationship in the frequency domain (FD) and handle the TL

been formally mapped into a discrete-time (DT) block model, which is useful to
simulate and estimate the channel response as well as to design optimal

an ABCD matrix, defined in the FD, and filtering kernels that allow an elegant
representation of the channel in the TD. The same formalism is valid for both
the Linear Time Invariant (LTI) and the Linear TV (LTV) cases, and bridges

spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism, that is gauge invariant and
renormalizable is investigated. A Stueckelberg formalism for massive $W$ and
$Z$ bosons is used to derive a gauge invariant EW theory. Negative energy
scalar fields that emerge from the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian are
removed by invoking an indefinite metric in Hilbert space. A unitary S-matrix
and a positive energy spectrum can be obtained by using the PT symmetric
formulation of the pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The theory predicts that if
for a system of particles the scalar boson energy $E_s < \mu=\lambda^{1/2}M_W$,
where $\lambda$ is a gauge parameter and $M_W$ is the $W$ boson mass, then as
$\lambda\rightarrow\infty$ the scalar boson mass $\mu=\lambda^{1/2}M_W$ tends
to infinity. The theory is perturbatively renormalizable and does not violate
longitudinally polarized $W_L W_L\rightarrow W_L W_L$ scattering in the energy
range $E < \mu=\lambda^{1/2}M_W$ for which the scalar bosons have decoupled and
they have an undetected mass. This means that with this scenario the EW theory
can only be treated as an effective renomalizable theory and not as a UV
complete theory.

to the orbit-averaged gravitational torques by the stars (Resonant Relaxation).
We show that the evolution of the MBH mass accretion rate, the MBH spin growth
rate, and the covering fraction of the disk relative to the central ionizing
continuum source, are all strongly coupled to the stochastic fluctuations of
the stellar potential via the warps that the stellar torques excite in the
disk. These lead to fluctuations by factors of up to a few in these quantities

response of the disk is stronger the lighter it is and the more centrally
concentrated the stellar cusp. As proof of concept, we simulate the evolution

states. Analysis of the hopping conduction suggests that the gap states become
slightly more delocalized with fluorine content, although metallic conduction
is not observed even for fluorine concentrations as large as x = 0.28.

the localization of the hadron wave functions when traversing the hadronization
transition. The extension of hadron wave functions in dense matter is governed
by the behavior of the chiral quark condensate such that its melting at finite
temperatures and chemical potentials entails an increase of the size of hadrons
and thus their geometrical strong interaction cross sections. It is
demonstrated within a schematic resonance gas model, that a kinetic freeze-out
condition reveals a correlation with the reduction of the chiral condensate in
the phase diagram up to 50 % of its vacuum value. Generalizing the description
of the chiral condensate by taking into account a full hadron resonance gas
such correlation gets distorted. We discuss, that this may be due to our
approximations in calculating the chiral condensate which disregard both,
in-medium effects on hadron masses and hadron-hadron interactions. The latter,
in particular due to quark exchange reactions, could lead to a delocalization
of the hadron wave functions in accordance with the picture of a Mott-Anderson
transition.

S^1, which allows to encode the semiclassical spectrum of a very large family
of string solutions in a Riemann surface, the spectral curve. Then, we show
that, in the large angular momentum limit, it separates into two distinct
surfaces, allowing the derivation of an explicit expression for the spectrum,
which is correspondingly characterised by two separate branches. The latter may
be interpreted in terms of two kinds of spikes appearing on the strings:
""large"" spikes, yielding an infinite contribution to the energy and angular
momentum of the string, and ""small"" spikes, representing finite excitations
over the background of the ""large"" spikes.
  On the other side of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider the sl(2) sector
of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. The corresponding 1-loop spectrum, in the large
conformal spin limit, is also encoded in a spectral curve and characterised in
terms of the so-called holes. We show that, with the appropriate
identifications and with the usual extrapolation from weak to strong 't Hooft
coupling described by the cusp anomalous dimension, the large-S spectra of
gauge theory and of string theory coincide. Furthermore, we explain how ""small""
and ""large"" holes may be identified with ""small"" and ""large"" spikes.
  Finally, we discuss several explicit spiky string solutions in AdS_3 which
display the finite-gap spectrum. We compute their spectral curves in the large
S limit, finding that they correspond to specific regions of the moduli space
of the finite-gap curves. We also explain how ""large"" spikes may be used in
order to extract a discrete system of degrees of freedom from string theory,
which can then be matched with the degrees of freedom of the dual gauge theory
operators, and how ""small"" spikes are in fact very similar to the Giant Magnons
living in R x S^2.

  expression","12 pages, 10 figures",,,,"q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RNA thermometers are mRNA strands with a temperature dependent secondary
structure: depending on the spatial conformation, the mRNA strand can get
translated (on-state) or can be inaccessible for ribosomes binding (off-state).
These have been found in a number of microorganisms (mainly pathogens), where
they are used to adaptively regulate the gene expression, in response to
changes in the environmental temperature. Besides naturally occurring RNA
thermometers, synthetic RNA thermometers have been recently designed by
modifying their natural counterparts (Hofacker et al., 2003). The newly
designed RNA thermometers are simpler, and exhibit a sharper switching between
off- and on-states. However, the proposed trial-and-error design procedure has
not been algorithmically formalized, and the switching temperature is rigidly
determined by the natural RNA thermometer used as template for the design.
  We developed a general algorithmic procedure (consensus distribution) for the
design of RNA thermo-switches with a tunable switching temperature that can be
decided in advance by the designer. A software tool with a user friendly GUI
has been written to automate the design of RNA thermo-switches with a desired
threshold temperature. Starting from a natural template, a new RNA thermometer
has been designed by our method for a new desired threshold temperature of 32C.
The designed RNA thermo-switch has been experimentally validated by using it to
control the expression of lucifarase. A 9.2 fold increase of luminescence has
been observed between 30C and 37C, whereas between 20C and 30C the luminescence
increase is less than 3-fold.
  This work represents a first step towards the design of flexible and tunable
RNA thermometers that can be used for a precise control of gene expression
without the need of external chemicals and possibly for temperature
measurements at a nano-scale resolution.

relay-interference channel with an in-band-reception and
out-of-band-transmission relay, where the link between the relay and the two
receivers is modelled as a degraded broadcast channel. It is shown that
generalized hash-and-forward (GHF) can achieve the capacity region of this
channel to within a constant number of bits in a certain weak relay regime,
where the transmitter-to-relay link gains are not unboundedly stronger than the
interference links between the transmitters and the receivers. The GHF relaying
strategy is ideally suited for the broadcasting relay because it can be
implemented in an incremental fashion, i.e., the relay message to one receiver
is a degraded version of the message to the other receiver. A
generalized-degree-of-freedom (GDoF) analysis in the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime reveals that in the symmetric channel setting, each common relay
bit can improve the sum rate roughly by either one bit or two bits
asymptotically depending on the operating regime, and the rate gain can be
interpreted as coming solely from the improvement of the common message rates,
or alternatively in the very weak interference regime as solely coming from the
rate improvement of the private messages. Further, this paper studies an
asymmetric case in which the relay has only a single single link to one of the
destinations. It is shown that with only one relay-destination link, the
approximate capacity region can be established for a larger regime of channel
parameters. Further, from a GDoF point of view, the sum-capacity gain due to
the relay can now be thought as coming from either signal relaying only, or
interference forwarding only.

key aspect in many areas of contemporary physics. However, as a direct
consequence of the difficultly of the so-called many-body problem, many exotic
quantum phenomena involving extended systems, such as high temperature
superconductivity, remain not well understood on a theoretical level.
Entanglement renormalization is a recently proposed numerical method for the
simulation of many-body systems which draws together ideas from the
renormalization group and from the field of quantum information. By taking due
care of the quantum entanglement of a system, entanglement renormalization has
the potential to go beyond the limitations of previous numerical methods and to
provide new insight to quantum collective phenomena. This thesis comprises a
significant portion of the research development of ER following its initial
proposal. This includes exploratory studies with ER in simple systems of free
particles, the development of the optimisation algorithms associated to ER, and
the early applications of ER in the study of quantum critical phenomena and
frustrated spin systems.

substantial effects in softening the equation of state. Because of the extra

the HLS vector mesons decouple from the nucleons before reaching the vector
manifestation fixed point. We suggest that cold baryonic system will flow to
this limit as density increases toward that of chiral restoration.

the presence of a deterministic vector signal. The signal to be detected is
assumed known \emph{a priori}. Given a constraint on the total amount of
transmit power, we investigate the optimal linear precoding design for each
sensor node. More specifically, in order to achieve the best detection
performance, shall sensor nodes transmit their raw data to the fusion center
(FC), or transmit compressed versions of their original data? The optimal power
allocation among sensors is studied as well. Also, assuming a fixed total
transmit power, we examine how the detection performance behaves with the
number of sensors in the network. A new concept ""detection outage"" is proposed
to quantify the reliability of the overall detection system. Finally,
decentralized detection with unknown signals is studied. Numerical results are
conducted to corroborate our theoretical analysis and to illustrate the
performance of the proposed algorithm.

pulsations in the 5-9 mHz frequency range at different layers of the solar

frequency oscillations are more pronounced closer to the umbra's center, while
the lower frequencies concentrate to the peripheral parts. We interpreted this

across the umbra at the level of temperature-minimum. Possible implications of
this interpretation for the diagnostics of sunspot atmospheres is discussed.

fraction of infected individuals, we model the behavioral changes in response
to how the extent of the epidemic is perceived. In our models, the behavioral
adaptations can be either `blind' or `selective' -- depending on whether a node
adapts by cutting or adding links to randomly chosen partners or selectively,
based on the state of the partner. For a frozen preferred network, we find that
the infection threshold follows the heterogeneous mean field result
$\lambda_{c}/\mu =<k>/<k^{2}>$ and the phase diagram matches the predictions of
the annealed adjacency matrix (AAM) approach. With `blind' adaptations,
although the epidemic threshold remains unchanged, the infection level is
substantially affected, depending on the details of the adaptation. The
`selective' adaptive SIS models are most interesting. Both the threshold and
the level of infection changes, controlled not only by how the adaptations are
implemented but also how often the nodes cut/add links (compared to the time
scales of the epidemic spreading). A simple mean field theory is presented for
the selective adaptations which capture the qualitative and some of the
quantitative features of the infection phase diagram.

originated from sequential two-step Auger decays of molecular double core-hole
(DCH) state, using CH4, NH3 and H2CO molecules as representative examples. For
CH4 and NH3 molecules, the DCH state has an empty 1s inner-shell orbital and
its Auger spectrum has two well separated components. One is originated from
the 1st Auger transition from the DCH state to the triply ionized states with
one core hole and two valence holes (CVV states) and the other is originated
from the 2nd Auger transition from the CVV states to quadruply valence ionized
(VVVV) states. Our result on the NH3 Auger spectrum is consistent with the
experimental spectrum of the DCH Auger decay observed recently [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 105, 213005 (2010)]. In contrast to CH4 and NH3 molecules, H2CO has four
different DCH states with C1s^{-2}, O1s^{-2} and C1s^{-1}O1s^{-1} (singlet and
triplet) configurations, and its Auger spectrum has more complicated structure
compared to the Auger spectra of CH4 and NH3 molecules. In the H2CO Auger
spectra, the C1s^{-1}O1s^{-1} DCH -> CVV Auger spectrum and the CVV -> VVVV
Auger spectrum overlap each other, which suggests that isolation of these Auger
components may be difficult in experiment. The C1s^{-2} and O1s^{-2} DCH -> CVV
Auger components are separated from the other components in the H2CO Auger
spectra, and can be observed in experiment. Two-dimensional Auger spectrum,
representing a probability of finding two Auger electrons at specific pair of
energies, may be obtained by four-electron coincidence detection technique in
experiment. Our calculation shows that this two-dimensional spectrum is useful
in understanding contributions of CVV and VVVV states to the Auger decay of
molecular DCH states.

Furthermore, based on Aubin-Lions compactness lemma, it is justified that the

The TD was
predicted long ago as a composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB)
associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale symmetry in
the walking technicolor (WTC). Being pNGB, whose mass arises from the explicit
scale-symmetry breaking due to the dynamical mass generation, the TD should
have a mass MTD lighter than other techni-hadrons, say MTD \simeq 600GeV for
the typical WTC model, which is well in the discovery range of the ongoing LHC
experiment. We develop a spurion method of nonlinear realization to calculate
the TD couplings to the standard model (SM) particles and explicitly evaluate
the TD LHC production cross sections at sqrt{s}=7TeV times the branching ratios
in terms of MTD as an input parameter for 200GeV<MTD<1TeV in the typical WTC
models: one-doublet model (1DM) and one-family model (1FM). It turns out that
the TD signatures are quite different from those of the SM Higgs. We compare
the TD->WW/ZZ signature with the recent ATLAS and CMS bounds and find that in
the case of 1DM the signature is consistent over the whole mass range due to
the large suppression of TD couplings, and by the same token the signal is too
tiny for the TD to be visible through this channel at LHC. As for the 1FM, on
the other hand, a severe constraint is given on MTD to exclude the TD with
MTD<600GeV, which, however, would imply an emergence of somewhat dramatic
excess as the TD signature at MTD>600GeV in the near future. We further find a
characteristic signature coming from the gamma gamma mode in the 1FM. In sharp
contrast to the SM Higgs case, it provides highly enhanced cross
section~0.10--1.0fb at around MTD \simeq 600GeV, which is large enough to be
discovered during the first few year's run at LHC.

the L2-norm (mean square error) -based peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Point

highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path
lengths, like random graphs. These characteristics result in networks with
unique properties of regional specialization with efficient information
transfer. Social networks are intuitive examples of this organization with
cliques or clusters of friends being interconnected, but each person is really
only 5-6 people away from anyone else. While this qualitative definition has
prevailed in network science theory, in application, the standard quantitative
application is to compare path length (a surrogate measure of distributed
processing) and clustering (a surrogate measure of regional specialization) to
an equivalent random network. It is demonstrated here that comparing network
clustering to that of a random network can result in aberrant findings and
networks once thought to exhibit small-world properties may not. We propose a
new small-world metric, {\omega} (omega), which compares network clustering to
an equivalent lattice network and path length to a random network, as Watts and
Strogatz originally described. Example networks are presented that would be
interpreted as small-world when clustering is compared to a random network but
are not small-world according to {\omega}. These findings have significant
implications in network science as small-world networks have unique topological
properties, and it is critical to accurately distinguish them from networks
without simultaneous high clustering and low path length.

certain inner linear system. We prove that the inexact SIRA method mimics the
exact SIRA well, that is, the former uses almost the same outer iterations to
achieve the convergence as the latter does if all the inner linear systems are
iteratively solved with {\em low} or {\em modest} accuracy during outer

inner solves. Our analysis is on one step expansion of subspace and the
approach applies to the Jacobi--Davidson (JD) method with the fixed target

over a 3 day NASA stratospheric balloon mission from Alice Springs, Australia.
The radiation damage, oxidation and nitration in the LDPE films exposed in
stratosphere were measured using ESR, FTIR and XPS spectroscopy. The results
were compared with those from samples stored on the ground and exposed in a
laboratory plasma. The types of free radicals, unsaturated hydrocarbon groups,
oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups in LDPE film exposed in the
stratosphere and at the Earth's surface are different. The radiation damage in
films exposed in the stratosphere are observed in the entire film due to the
penetration of high energy cosmic rays through their thickness, while the
radiation damage in films exposed on the ground is caused by sunlight
penetrating into only a thin surface layer. A similarly thin layer of the film
is damaged by exposure to plasma due to the low energy of the plasma particles.
The intensity of oxidation and nitration of LDPE films reflects the difference
of atmospheric pressure on the ground and in the stratosphere. The high-density
radiation damage of the LDPE films above the ozone layer in the stratosphere is
caused by primary cosmic rays as well as collision induced cosmic ray air
showers, and is consistent with the measured flux of cosmic radiation. The
results show, that stratospheric flights can be used to simulate the effects of
space environments during interplanet space flights for the purposes of
investigating the degradation of polymer materials.

leads to the formation of composition-modulated surface patterns. It is shown
that the ion-to-atom arrival ratio R is the pattern control parameter. Close to
the instability threshold we identify different regimes of instabilities driven
by ion- or deposition-induced surface roughness processes, or
roughness-composition feedback interactions. In particular, the synergistic
effects of the curvature-dependent displacement and deposition coupling to the
preferential sputtering or to the preferential diffusivity are found to induce
instabilities and pattern formation. Depending on the film growth and
ion-irradiation conditions, the instabilities show stationary or oscillating
behavior. The latter one is exclusively connected with ion irradiation. The
corresponding phase diagrams are presented in terms of experimentally
accessible parameters. This shows an alternative way to control surface

simplest example corresponds to k=1 and is essentially a nonuniform
generalization of the Haldane-Shastry model with long-range exchange couplings.
At level k=2, we analyze the model for N spin 1 fields. We find that the Renyi

a chromosphere. The NLTE computations provide line intensities and contribution
functions that indicate the relative locations where the line cores are formed
and can constrain the size of the limb-darkened disk of the stars with
chromospheres. We measured the angular diameter of seven K giant stars and
deduced their fundamental parameters: effective temperatures, radii,
luminosities, and masses. We determined the geometrical extent of the
chromosphere for four giant stars. The chromosphere extents obtained range
between 16% to 47% of the stellar radius. The NLTE computations confirm that
the Ca II/849 nm line core is deeper in the chromosphere of ? Cet than either
of the Ca II/854 nm and Ca II/866 nm line cores. We present a modified version
of a semi-empirical model atmosphere derived by fitting the Ca II triplet line

differential signal showing the presence of asymmetries in the chromospheres.
Conclusions. It is the first time that geometrical extents and structure in the
chromospheres of non-binary K giant stars are determined by interferometry.

relative \'etale homotopy type that was used in [HaSc] for the study of
obstructions to the existence of rational points. This relative notion enables
to generalize these homotopical obstructions from fields to general base
schemas and general maps of topoi.
  Our model structure is constructed using a general theorem that we prove.
Namely, we introduce a much weaker structure than a model category, which we
call a ""weak fibration category"". Our theorem says that a weak fibration
category can be ""completed"" into a full model category structure on its
pro-category, provided it satisfies some additional technical requirements. Our
model structure is obtained by applying this result to the weak fibration
category of simplicial sheaves over a Grothendieck site, where the weak
equivalences and the fibrations are local in the sense of Jardine [Jar].

DeGroot model to a dynamic setting. In the ""best response"" model, players
calculate minimum variance linear estimators of the underlying state.

CH3CHO, CH3OD and HCOOD for IRAS22198+6336, and C6H, and O13CS for AFGL5142.
The emission of complex molecules is resolved down to sizes of ~300 and ~600

protostellar disks rather than flattened envelopes or toroids as usually found.

velocity gradient for all the mapped molecules perpendicular to the most
chemically rich outflow of the region, yielding a dynamic mass >4 Msun. As for
AFGL5142, the hot core emission is resolved into two elongated cores separated
1800 AU. A detailed comparison of the complex molecule peaks to the new CO(2-1)
data and H2O maser data from literature suggests that also for AFGL5142 the
complex molecules are mainly associated with disks, except for a faint and
extended molecular emission found to the west, which is possibly produced in

gluon nucleon structure. We review recent progress in this domain, emphasizing
the need to supplement the experimental study of DVCS by its crossed version,
timelike Compton scattering (TCS), where data at high energy should appear
thanks to the study of ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC. This will open
the access to very low skewness quark and gluon GPDs. Our leading order
estimates show that the factorization scale dependence of the amplitudes is
quite high. This fact demands the understanding of higher order contributions
with the hope that they will stabilize this scale dependence. The magnitudes of
the NLO coefficient functions are not small and neither is the difference of
the coefficient functions appearing respectively in the DVCS and TCS
amplitudes. The conclusion is that extracting the universal GPDs from both TCS
and DVCS reactions requires much care. We also describe the extension of the
GPD concept to three quark operators and the relevance of their nucleon to
meson matrix elements, namely the transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs)
which factorize in hard exclusive pion electroproduction off a nucleon in the
backward region and baryon-antibaryon annihilation into a pion and a lepton
pair. We discuss the main properties of the TDAs.

microscopy of both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domain structures reveals
that domain correlations and strong inter-ferroic domain wall pinning persist
in an applied electric field. This leads to an unprecedented electric

evolved into one of the highest priorities for understanding neutrinos and the
origin of mass. The main reason for this paradigm shift has been the discovery
of neutrino oscillations, which clearly established the existence of massive
neutrinos. An additional motivation for conducting such searches comes from the
existence of an unconfirmed, but not refuted, claim of evidence for
neutrinoless double decay in $^{76}\text{Ge}$. As a consequence, a new
generation of experiments, employing different detection techniques and
$\beta\beta$ isotopes, is being actively promoted by experimental groups across
the world. In addition, nuclear theorists are making remarkable progress in the
calculation of the neutrinoless double beta decay nuclear matrix elements, thus
eliminating a substantial part of the theoretical uncertainties affecting the
particle physics interpretation of this process. In this report, we review the
main aspects of the double beta decay process and some of the most relevant
experiments. The picture that emerges is one where searching for neutrinoless
double beta decay is recognized to have both far-reaching theoretical
implications and promising prospects for experimental observation in the near
future.

the $k_\perp$-factorization approach (with both the standard QCD and the
Lipatov's effective three-gluon verticies) and is considered in various
kinematical asymptotia, in particular, in the important limit of high-$p_\perp$
jets. Compared to earlier works we include emissions of gluons from different
gluonic $t$-channel lines as well as emission of quark-antiquark dijets.
Rapidity distributions, gluon jet $p_\perp$ distributions and invariant dijet
mass distributions are presented. We explore the competition of the standard
diagram with both jets emitted from a single $t$-channel gluon and the one with
the emission from both $t$-channel gluons. The second mechanism requires a
special treatment. We propose two different approaches. Including special
kinematics and using properties of off-diagonal gluons at small $x$ and $\xi$
we arrive to correlations in two-dimensional distributions in rapidity of one

known from the literature. The digluon production constitutes an important

This comes
mainly from the fact that the number of thread interleavings grows
exponentially in the number of threads. The idea that thread interleavings can
be studied with a matrix calculus is a novel approach in this research area.
Our sparse matrix representations of the program are manipulated using a lazy
implementation of Kronecker algebra. One goal is the generation of a data
structure called Concurrent Program Graph (CPG) which describes all possible
interleavings and incorporates synchronization while preserving completeness.
We prove that CPGs in general can be represented by sparse adjacency matrices.
Thus the number of entries in the matrices is linear in their number of lines.
Hence efficient algorithms can be applied to CPGs. In addition, due to
synchronization only very small parts of the resulting matrix are actually
needed, whereas the rest is unreachable in terms of automata. Thanks to the
lazy implementation of the matrix operations the unreachable parts are never
calculated. This speeds up processing significantly and shows that this
approach is very promising. Various applications including data flow analysis
can be performed on CPGs. Furthermore, the structure of the matrices can be
used to prove properties of the underlying program for an arbitrary number of
threads. For example, deadlock freedom is proved for a large class of programs.

individual. Comparison is based on a total cost of epidemic, including cost of
palliative treatment of ill individuals and preventive cost aimed at
vaccination or culling of susceptible individuals. Disease is characterized by
pre- symptomatic phase which makes detection and control difficult. Three
general strategies emerge, global preventive treatment, local treatment within
a neighborhood of certain size and only palliative treatment with no
prevention. The choice between the strategies depends on relative costs of
palliative and preventive treatment. The details of the local strategy and in
particular the size of the optimal treatment neighborhood weakly depends on
disease infectivity but strongly depends on other epidemiological factors. The
required extend of prevention is proportional to the size of the infection
neighborhood, but this relationship depends on time till detection and time
till treatment in a non-nonlinear (power) law. In addition, we show that the
optimal size of control neighborhood is highly sensitive to the relative cost,
particularly for inefficient detection and control application. These results

Generalized kinetic equations which were derived by the method of the

modified tight-binding approximation (MTBA) were used for describing the
electron subsystem and the electron-lattice interaction correspondingly. The
low- and high-temperature behavior of the resistivity was discussed in detail.
The main objects of discussion are nonmagnetic (or paramagnetic) transition

binary substitutional alloys, but the formalism developed can be applied (with
suitable modification), in principle, to other systems. The approach we used

vertices. The (strong) rainbow connection number of $G$, denoted by ($scr(G)$,
respectively) $rc(G)$, is the smallest number of colors that are needed in
order to make $G$ (strongly) rainbow connected. Though for a general graph $G$
it is NP-Complete to decide whether $rc(G)=2$, in this paper, we show that the
problem becomes easy when $G$ is a bipartite graph. Moreover, it is known that
deciding whether a given edge-colored (with an unbound number of colors) graph
is rainbow connected is NP-Complete. We will prove that it is still NP-Complete
even when the edge-colored graph is bipartite. We also show that a few NP-hard
problems on rainbow connection are indeed NP-Complete.

Shannon's attacker model by taking into account the fact that the real

  Shannon also sought security against the attacker with unlimited logical and
observational powers, expressed through the maxim that ""the enemy knows the

going back to Kerckhoffs, is that ""there is no security by obscurity"", meaning
that the algorithms cannot be kept obscured from the attacker, and that
security should only rely upon the secret keys. In fact, modern cryptography
goes even further than Shannon or Kerckhoffs in tacitly assuming that *if there

but he is still construed as an omnipotent programmer.
  So the Diffie-Hellman step from unlimited to limited computational powers has
not been extended into a step from unlimited to limited logical or programming

discovered and implemented really different from the assumption that everything
that is computable will eventually be computed? The present paper explores some
ways to refine the current models of the attacker, and of the defender, by
taking into account their limited logical and programming powers. If the
adaptive attacker actively queries the system to seek out its vulnerabilities,
can the system gain some security by actively learning attacker's methods, and
adapting to them?

plasmonic crystal is cut normally to the layer interfaces and brought into the
contact with semi-infinite dielectric, a new type of surface modes can appear.
The propagation of such modes obliquely to the optical axes occurs under
favorable conditions that regard thicknesses of the layers, as well as the
proper choice of dielectric permittivity of the constituent materials. We show
that losses within the metallic layers can be substantially reduced by making
the layers sufficiently thin. At the same time, a dramatic enlargement of the
range of angles for oblique propagation of the new surface modes is observed.
This can lead, however, to the field non-locality and consequently to the
failure of the effective-medium approximation.

accessed via the power spectrum of the so called convergence. We use the Fisher
information matrix formalism with the convergence power spectrum as the
observable to predict how future weak lensing surveys will constrain the
expansion rate and the growth function as functions of redshift without using
any specific model to parameterize these two quantities. To do this, we divide
redshift space into bins and linearly interpolate the functions with the
centers of the redshift bins as sampling points, using a fiducial set of
parameters. At the same time, we use these redshift bins for power spectrum
tomography, where we analyze not only the power spectrum in each bin but also
their cross-correlation in order to maximize the extracted information. We find
that a small number of bins with the given photometric redshift mea- surement
precision is sufficient to access most of the information content and that the
projected constraints are comparable to current constraints from X-ray cluster
growth data. This way, the weak lensing data alone might be able to rule out

reionization era, the 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen (HI) in the
post-reionization epoch is believed to be an excellent tracer of the underlying
dark matter distribution. Assuming a background cosmology, it is modelled
through (i) a bias function b(k,z), which relates HI to the dark matter
distribution and (ii) a mean neutral fraction (x_{HI}) which sets its
amplitude. In this paper, we investigate the nature of large scale HI bias. The
post-reionization HI is modelled using gravity only N-Body simulations and a
suitable prescription for assigning gas to the dark matter halos. Using the
simulated bias as the fiducial model for HI distribution at z\leq 4, we have
generated a hypothetical data set for the 21-cm angular power spectrum (C_{l})
using a noise model based on parameters of an extended version of the GMRT. The
binned C_{l} is assumed to be measured with SNR \gtrsim 4 in the range 400 \leq
l \leq 8000 at a fiducial redshift z=2.5. We explore the possibility of
constraining b(k) using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on this
simulated data. Our analysis shows that in the range 0.2 < k < 2 Mpc^{-1}, the
simulated data set cannot distinguish between models exhibiting different k
dependences, provided 1 \lesssim b(k) \lesssim 2 which sets the 2-sigma limits.
This justifies the use of linear bias model on large scales. The largely
uncertain x_{HI} is treated as a free parameter resulting in degradation of the
bias reconstruction. The given simulated data is found to constrain the
fiducial x_{HI} with an accuracy of \sim 4% (2-sigma error). The method
outlined here, could be successfully implemented on future observational data
sets to constrain b(k,z) and x_{HI} and thereby enhance our understanding of
the low redshift Universe.

analysis is carried out for pp collisions for pions and kaons and qualitative
similarities to heavy-ion data are seen, especially in collisions producing
large number of particles. The observed trends give insight into the soft
particle production mechanism in pp collisions. 3D radii were also found to
universally scale with event multiplicity in heavy-ion collisions. We extend
the range of multiplicities both upwards with the Pb-Pb data and downwards with
the pp data to test the scaling in new areas. In particular the high
multiplicity pp collisions reach particle densities comparable to the ones
measured in peripheral Cu-Cu and Au-Au collisions at RHIC. This allows for the
first time to directly compare freeze-out sizes for systems with very different
initial states.

with those of other emissions together with regional differences reflecting the

proposed to be the descendant of a strongly magnetic Ap star. We have performed
a spectropolarimetric study of EK Eri over 4 photometric periods with the aim
of inferring the topology of its magnetic field. We used the NARVAL
spectropolarimeter at the Bernard Lyot telescope at the Pic du Midi
Observatory, along with the least-squares deconvolution method, to extract high
signal-to-noise ratio Stokes V profiles from a timeseries of 28 polarisation
spectra. We have derived the surface-averaged longitudinal magnetic field Bl.
We fit the Stokes V profiles with a model of the large-scale magnetic field and
obtained Zeeman Doppler images of the surface magnetic strength and geometry.
Bl variations of up to about 80 G are observed without any reversal of its
sign, and which are in phase with photometric ephemeris. The activity
indicators are shown to vary smoothly on a timescale compatible with the
rotational period inferred from photometry (308.8 d.), however large deviations
can occur from one rotation to another. The surface magnetic field variations
of EK Eri appear to be dominated by a strong magnetic spot (of negative
polarity) which is phased with the dark (cool) photometric spot. Our modeling
shows that the large-scale magnetic field of EK Eri is strongly poloidal. For a
rotational axis inclination of i = 60{\deg}, we obtain a model that is almost
purely dipolar. In the dipolar model, the strong magnetic/photometric spot
corresponds to the negative pole of the dipole, which could be the remnant of
that of an Ap star progenitor of EK Eri. Our observations and modeling
conceptually support this hypothesis, suggesting an explanation of the
outstanding magnetic properties of EK Eri as the result of interaction between
deep convection and the remnant of an Ap star magnetic dipole.

whose classical counterpart has a chaotic dynamics. It is based on two
assumptions: (1) matrix-element independence, and (2) base invariance. Last
decade witnessed several attempts to extend RMT to describe quantum systems
with mixed regular-chaotic dynamics. Most of the proposed generalizations keep
the first assumption and violate the second. Recently, several authors
presented other versions of the theory that keep base invariance on the expense
of allowing correlations between matrix elements. This is achieved by starting
from non-extensive entropies rather than the standard Shannon entropy, or
following the basic prescription of the recently suggested concept of
superstatistics. The latter concept was introduced as a generalization of
equilibrium thermodynamics to describe non-equilibrium systems by allowing the
temperature to fluctuate. We here review the superstatistical generalizations
of RMT and illustrate their value by calculating the nearest-neighbor-spacing
distributions and comparing the results of calculation with experiments on

disk galaxy. We use a two-dimensional velocity field in H{\alpha} emission
obtained with Fabry-Perot interferometry, derive the classical rotation curve,
and subtract it off, leaving a residual velocity map. As the streaming motions
should reverse sign at corotation, we detect these reversals, and plot them in
a histogram against galactocentric radius, excluding points where the amplitude
of the reversal is smaller than the measurement uncertainty. The histograms
show well-defined peaks which we assume to occur at resonance radii,
identifying corotations as the most prominent peaks corresponding to the
relevant morphological features of the galaxy (notably bars and spiral arm
systems). We compare our results with published measurements on the same
galaxies using other methods and different types of data.

scalar field slowly rolling along a nearly flat valley. Inflation ends with a
waterfall phase, due to a tachyonic instability. This final phase is usually
assumed to be nearly instantaneous. In this thesis, we go beyond these
approximations and analyze the exact 2-field dynamics of hybrid models. Several
effects are put in evidence: 1) the possible slow-roll violations along the
valley induce the non existence of inflation at small field values. Provided
super-planckian fields, the scalar spectrum of the original model is red, in
agreement with observations. 2) The initial field values are not fine-tuned
along the valley but also occupy a considerable part of the field space
exterior to it. They form a structure with fractal boundaries. Using bayesian
methods, their distribution in the whole parameter space is studied. Natural
bounds on the potential parameters are derived. 3) For the original model,
inflation is found to continue for more than 60 e-folds along waterfall
trajectories in some part of the parameter space. The scalar power spectrum of
adiabatic perturbations is modified and is generically red, possibly in
agreement with CMB observations. Topological defects are conveniently stretched
outside the observable Universe. 4) The analysis of the initial conditions is
extended to the case of a closed Universe, in which the initial singularity is
replaced by a classical bounce. In the third part of the thesis, we study how
the present CMB constraints on the cosmological parameters could be ameliorated
with the observation of the 21cm cosmic background, by future giant
radio-telescopes. Forecasts are determined for a characteristic Fast Fourier
Transform Telescope, by using both Fisher matrix and MCMC methods.

two-dimensional Fermi gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By solving
the exact two-body problem in the presence of an attractive short-range
interaction we show that the SOC enhances the formation of the bound state: the
binding energy $E_{\text B}$ and effective mass $m_{\text B}$ of the bound
state grows along with the increase of the SOC. For the many-body problem, even
at weak attraction, a dilute Fermi gas can evolve from a BCS superfluid state
to a Bose condensation of molecules when the SOC becomes comparable to the
Fermi momentum. The ground-state properties and the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature are studied, and
analytical results are obtained in various limits. For large SOC, the BKT
transition temperature recovers that for a Bose gas with an effective mass
$m_{\text B}$. We find that the condensate and superfluid densities have
distinct behaviors in the presence of SOC: the condensate density is generally
enhanced by the SOC due to the increase of the molecule binding, the superfluid
density is suppressed because of the non-trivial molecule effective mass
$m_{\text B}$.

(with total initial energy well-below the ionization threshold) relaxes to its
ground state while its excess energy is emitted as radiation. Hence, for large
times, the state of the atom+field system should consist of the atom in its
ground state, and a few free photons that travel off to spatial infinity.
Mathematically, this picture is captured by the notion of asymptotic
completeness. Despite some recent progress on the spectral theory of such
systems, a proof of relaxation to the ground state and asymptotic completeness
was/is still missing, except in some special cases (massive photons, small
perturbations of harmonic potentials). In this paper, we partially fill this
gap by proving relaxation to an invariant state in the case where the atom is
modelled by a finite-level system. If the coupling to the field is sufficiently
infrared-regular so that the coupled system admits a ground state, then this
invariant state necessarily corresponds to the ground state. Assuming slightly
more infrared regularity, we show that the number of emitted photons remains
bounded in time. We hope that these results bring a proof of asymptotic
completeness within reach.

three such terms. A first one corresponds to the overlap between the clouds
dressing two polarons. The two other ones are due to the modification of the
single polaron binding energy caused by the non-zero density of polarons. The
second term is due to the restriction of the polaron momentum by the Fermi sea
formed by the other polarons. The last one results from the modification of the
spin-up Fermi sea brought by the other polarons. The calculation of all these
terms is made at the simplest level of a single particle-hole excitation. It is
performed for all the possible interaction strengths within the stability range
of the polaron. At unitarity the last two terms give a fairly weak contribution
while the first one is strong and leads to a marked disagreement with
Monte-Carlo results. The possible origins of this discrepancy are discussed.

algorithms for complex networks. A variety of computational heuristics, some
with a long history, have been proposed for the identification of communities
or, alternatively, of good graph partitions. In most cases, the algorithms
maximize a particular objective function, thereby finding the `right' split
into communities. Although a thorough comparison of algorithms is still
lacking, there has been an effort to design benchmarks, i.e., random graph
models with known community structure against which algorithms can be
evaluated. However, popular community detection methods and benchmarks normally
assume an implicit notion of community based on clique-like subgraphs, a form
of community structure that is not always characteristic of real networks.
Specifically, networks that emerge from geometric constraints can have natural
non clique-like substructures with large effective diameters, which can be
interpreted as long-range communities. In this work, we show that long-range
communities escape detection by popular methods, which are blinded by a
restricted `field-of-view' limit, an intrinsic upper scale on the communities
they can detect. The field-of-view limit means that long-range communities tend
to be overpartitioned. We show how by adopting a dynamical perspective towards
community detection (Delvenne et al. (2010) PNAS:107: 12755-12760; Lambiotte et
al. (2008) arXiv:0812.1770), in which the evolution of a Markov process on the
graph is used as a zooming lens over the structure of the network at all
scales, one can detect both clique- or non clique-like communities without
imposing an upper scale to the detection. Consequently, the performance of
algorithms on inherently low-diameter, clique-like benchmarks may not always be
indicative of equally good results in real networks with local, sparser
connectivity.

major processes: photodissociation near the disk surface, and depletion on dust
grains in the disk mid-plane, resulting in a layered structure with molecules
located in a warm layer above the disk mid-plane. We attempt here to confront
this warm molecular layer model prediction with the distribution of two key
molecules for dissociation processes: CN and HCN. Using the IRAM Plateau de
Bure interferometer, we obtained high spatial and spectral resolution images of
the CN J=2-1 and HCN J=1-0 lines in the disks surrounding the two T-Tauri DM
Tau and LkCa 15 and the Herbig Ae MWC 480. Disk properties are derived assuming
power law distributions. The hyperfine structure of the observed transitions
allows us to constrain the line opacities and excitation temperatures. We
compare the observational results with predictions from existing chemical
models, and use a simple PDR model (without freeze-out of molecules on grains
and surface chemistry) to illustrate dependencies on UV field strength, grain
size and gas-to-dust ratio. We also evaluate the impact of Lyman alpha
radiation. The temperature ordering follows the trend found from CO lines, with
DM Tau being the coldest object and MWC 480 the warmest. Although CN indicates
somewhat higher excitation temperatures than HCN, the derived values in the
T-Tauri disks are very low (8-10 K). They agree with results obtained from CCH,
and are in contradiction with thermal and chemical model predictions. These
very low temperatures, as well as geometrical constraints, suggest that
substantial amounts of CN and HCN remain in the gas phase close to the disk
mid-plane, and that this mid-plane is quite cold. The observed CN/HCN ratio

on several current topics.
  First and foremost, these Herschel observations will settle whether or not
there is a phase change in the vertical structure of the ISM with disk mass.
Previously, a dramatic change in dustlane morphology was observed as in massive
disks the dust collapses into a thin lane. If this is the case, the vertical
balance between turbulence and gravity dictates the ISM structure and
consequently star-formation and related phenomena (spiral arms, bars etc.). We
specifically target lower mass nearby edge-ons to complement existing Herschel
observations of high-mass edge-on spirals (the HEROES project).
  Secondly, the combined data-set, together with existing Spitzer observations,
will drive a new generation of spiral disk Spectral Energy Distribution models.
These model how dust reprocesses starlight to thermal emission but the dust
geometry remains the critical unknown.
  And thirdly, the observations will provide an accurate and unbiased census of
the cold dusty structures occasionally seen extending out of the plane of the
disk, when backlit by the stellar disk. To illustrate the NHEMESES project, we
present early results on NGC 4244 and NGC 891, two well studies examples of a
low and high-mass edge-on spiral.

studied using a 2.5D MHD code. The initial atmosphere is static and isothermal,
with a temperature of 20,000 K. The initial magnetic field is uniform and
vertical. Two physical environments with different magnetic field strength (25
G and 50 G) are presented. In each case, two sub-cases are discussed, where the
environments have different initial mass density. In the case where we have a
weaker magnetic field (25 G) and higher plasma density ($N_e=2\times 10^{11}$
cm$^{-3}$), valid for the typical quiet Sun chromosphere, a plasma jet would be
observed with a temperature of 2--3 $\times 10^4$ K and a velocity as high as
40 km/s. The opposite case of a medium with a lower electron density
($N_e=2\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), i.e. more typical for the transition region,
and a stronger magnetic field of 50 G, up-flows with line-of-sight velocities
as high as 90 km/s and temperatures of 6 $\times$ 10$^5$ K, i.e. upper
transition region -- low coronal temperatures, are produced. Only in the latter
case, the low corona Fe IX 171 \AA\ shows a response in the jet which is
comparable to the O V increase. The results show that magnetic reconnection can
be an efficient mechanism to drive plasma outflows in the chromosphere and
transition region. The model can reproduce characteristics, such as temperature
and velocity for a range of jet features like a fibril, a spicule, an hot X-ray
jet or a transition region jet by changing either the magnetic field strength
or the electron density, i.e. where in the atmosphere the reconnection occurs.

quantization of homogeneous cosmological models obtained from General
Relativity by symmetry reduction. As a necessary step towards the extraction of
realistic results from Loop Quantum Cosmology, we should consider the inclusion
of inhomogeneities, which play a central role in current cosmology. The main
goal of this thesis is to progress in this direction. With this aim we have
studied a natural test bed to incorporate inhomogeneities in Loop Quantum
Cosmology: the linearly polarized Gowdy T3 model. This model can be regarded as
a homogeneous Bianchi I background filled with inhomogeneities propagating in
one direction. We have completed its quantization by means of a hybrid
approach, that combines the loop quantization of the homogeneous sector, within
the so-called improved dynamics scheme, with a Fock quantization for the
inhomogeneities. In order to perform this quantization as thorough as possible,
we have also reviewed the (improved dynamics) loop quantization of flat FRW
cosmologies, paradigmatic model in LQC, as well as that of the Bianchi I model.
We have proposed a new prescription for the Hamiltonian constraint operator of
these models, that displays nicer features than those of previous proposals. In
particular, we get simpler superselection sectors with a global and
well-understood Wheeler-DeWitt limit in the large volume regime, which serve to
improve our understanding of the physical Hilbert space of these models.

numerical simulation as well as diagnostic methods including current

Both direct and stepwise electron impact excitation of nitrogen emissions are

decoupled with the undriven lattice sites. The CDT even takes place in lattice

X-ray images of the cluster show five main constituents of diffuse emission :
A3395 NE, A3395 SW, A3395 NW, A3395 W, and a filament connecting NE to W. X-ray
surface-brightness profiles of the cluster did not show any shock fronts in the
cluster. Temperature and entropy maps show high temperature and high entropy
regions in the W, the NW, the filament and between the NE and SW subclusters.
The NE, SW and W components have X-ray bolometric luminosities similar to those
of rich clusters of galaxies but have relatively higher temperatures.
Similarly, the NW component has X-ray bolometric luminosity similar to that of
isolated groups but with much higher temperature. It is, therefore, possible
that all the components of the cluster have been heated by the ongoing mergers.
The NE subcluster is the most massive and luminous constituent and other
subclusters are found to be gravitationally bound to it. The W component is
most probably either a clump of gas stripped off the SW due to ram pressure or
a separate subcluster that has merged or is merging with the SW. No X-ray
cavities are seen associated with the Wide Angle Tailed (WAT) radio source near
the centre of the SW subcluster. Minimum energy pressure in the radio
emission-peaks of the WAT galaxy is comparable with the external thermal
pressure. The radio spectrum of the WAT suggests a spectral age of ~10Myr.

  Systems",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The well-studied Hindmarsh-Rose model of neural action potential is revisited
from the point of view of global bifurcation analysis. This slow-fast system of
three paremeterised differential equations is arguably the simplest reduction
of Hodgkin-Huxley models capable of exhibiting all qualitatively important
distinct kinds of spiking and bursting behaviour. First, keeping the singular
perturbation parameter fixed, a comprehensive two-parameter bifurcation diagram
is computed by brute force. Of particular concern is the parameter regime where
lobe-shaped regions of irregular bursting undergo a transition to stripe-shaped
regions of periodic bursting. The boundary of each stripe represents a fold
bifurcation that causes a smooth spike-adding transition where the number of
spikes in each burst is increased by one. Next, numerical continuation studies
reveal that the global structure is organised by various curves of homoclinic
bifurcations.
  In particular the lobe to stripe transition is organised by a sequence of
codimension-two orbit- and inclination-flip points that occur along {\em each}
homoclinic branch. Each branch undergoes a sharp turning point and hence
approximately has a double-cover of the same curve in parameter space. The
sharp turn is explained in terms of the interaction between a two-dimensional
unstable manifold and a one-dimensional slow manifold in the singular limit.
Finally, a new local analysis is undertaken using approximate Poincar\'{e} maps
to show that the turning point on each homoclinic branch in turn induces an
inclination flip that gives birth to the fold curve that organises the
spike-adding transition. Implications of this mechanism for explaining
spike-adding behaviour in other excitable systems are discussed.

comprises three distinct components: a large buried array for ultrahigh energy
neutrino detection, a surface air shower array, and a new buried component
called DeepCore. DeepCore was designed to lower the IceCube neutrino energy
threshold by over an order of magnitude, to energies as low as about 10 GeV.
DeepCore is situated primarily 2100 m below the surface of the icecap at the
South Pole, at the bottom center of the existing IceCube array, and began
taking physics data in May 2010. Its location takes advantage of the
exceptionally clear ice at those depths and allows it to use the surrounding
IceCube detector as a highly efficient active veto against the principal
background of downward-going muons produced in cosmic-ray air showers. DeepCore
has a module density roughly five times higher than that of the standard
IceCube array, and uses photomultiplier tubes with a new photocathode featuring
a quantum efficiency about 35% higher than standard IceCube PMTs. Taken
together, these features of DeepCore will increase IceCube's sensitivity to
neutrinos from WIMP dark matter annihilations, atmospheric neutrino
oscillations, galactic supernova neutrinos, and point sources of neutrinos in
the northern and southern skies. In this paper we describe the design and
initial performance of DeepCore.
