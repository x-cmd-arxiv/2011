time-invariant energy sources, in wireless cooperative communication. For the
purpose of exposition, we study the classic three-node Gaussian relay channel
with decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, in which the source and relay nodes
transmit with power drawn from energy-harvesting (EH) sources. Assuming a
deterministic EH model under which the energy arrival time and the harvested
amount are known prior to transmission, the throughput maximization problem
over a finite horizon of $N$ transmission blocks is investigated. In
particular, two types of data traffic with different delay constraints are
considered: delay-constrained (DC) traffic (for which only one-block decoding
delay is allowed at the destination) and no-delay-constrained (NDC) traffic
(for which arbitrary decoding delay up to $N$ blocks is allowed). For the DC
case, we show that the joint source and relay power allocation over time is
necessary to achieve the maximum throughput, and propose an efficient algorithm
to compute the optimal power profiles. For the NDC case, although the
throughput maximization problem is non-convex, we prove the optimality of a
separation principle for the source and relay power allocation problems, based
upon which a two-stage power allocation algorithm is developed to obtain the
optimal source and relay power profiles separately. Furthermore, we compare the
DC and NDC cases, and obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions under
which the NDC case performs strictly better than the DC case. It is shown that
NDC transmission is able to exploit a new form of diversity arising from the
independent source and relay energy availability over time in cooperative
communication, termed ""energy diversity"", even with time-invariant channels.

the distributions of these coefficients. We analytically evaluate the moments

derived using the characteristic function approach need to be supplemented with
a correction term. The correction term is found to be important particularly at

the realization of quantum information processing using single electron spins.
Alternative proposals have been made to use spin qubits based on valence band
holes having weaker hyperfine coupling. However, it was demonstrated recently
both theoretically and experimentally that the hole hyperfine interaction is
not negligible, although a consistent picture of the mechanism controlling the
magnitude of the hole-nuclear coupling is still lacking. Here we address this
problem by performing isotope selective measurement of the valence band
hyperfine coupling in InGaAs/GaAs, InP/GaInP and GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots.
Contrary to existing models we find that the hole hyperfine constant along the
growth direction of the structure (normalized by the electron hyperfine
constant) has opposite signs for different isotopes and ranges from -15% to
+15%. We attribute such changes in hole hyperfine constants to the competing
positive contributions of p-symmetry atomic orbitals and the negative
contributions of d-orbitals. Furthermore, we find that the d-symmetry
contribution leads to a new mechanism for hole-nuclear spin flips which may
play an important role in hole spin decoherence. In addition the measured
hyperfine constants enable a fundamentally new approach for verification of the
computed Bloch wavefunctions in the vicinity of nuclei in semiconductor
nanostructures.

exhibits a series of peaks that can be interpreted as Bragg reflections from

large magnetic cross section, show clear evidence for a magnetic superstructure
with a commensurate period of five wires, which we interpret as commensurately

non-trivial reorganization of the magnetization within each wire, likely
results from classical dipole interactions among the wires. We introduce a
simple, exactly soluble, analytic model of the scattering that captures,
semi-quantitatively, the primary features in the RSXS data; this model will act
as a foundation for forthcoming, detailed studies of the magnetic structure in
these systems.

for this type of calculations, is based on high order finite volume and
discontinuous Galerkin methods as recently proposed by Dumbser & Zanotti
(2009). The possibility of producing high Lorentz factors is discussed, by
studying the effects produced on the dynamics by different magnetization and
resistivity regimes. We show that Lorentz factors close to ~4 can be produced
for a plasma magnetization parameter sigma=20. Moreover, we find that the
Sweet-Parker layers are unstable, generating secondary magnetic islands, but
only for S>S_c~10^8, much larger than what is reported in the Newtonian regime.

Lundquist number and the macrosopic system size in units of the ion sound
gyroradius. In addition to the conventional single X-line collisional and
collisionless phases, multiple X-line reconnection phases arise due to the
presence of the plasmoid instability either in collisional and collisionless
current sheets. In particular, there exists a unique phase termed ""multiple
X-line hybrid phase"" where a hierarchy of collisional islands or plasmoids is
terminated by a collisionless current sheet, resulting in a rapid coupling
between the macroscopic and kinetic scales and a mixture of collisional and
collisionless dynamics. The new phases involving multiple X-lines and
collisionless physics may be important for the emerging applications of
magnetic reconnection to accelerate charged particles beyond their thermal
speeds. A large number of heliophysical and astrophysical plasmas are surveyed
and grouped in the phase diagram: Earth's magnetosphere, solar plasmas
(chromosphere, corona, wind and tachocline), galactic plasmas (molecular
clouds, interstellar media, accretion disks and their coronae, Crab nebula, Sgr
A*, gamma ray bursts, magnetars), extragalactic plasmas (Active Galactic Nuclei

Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments using the datasets crawled from

generative models with social influence significantly outperform those without
incorporating social influence. The unified generative model proposed in this
paper obtains the best performance. Moreover, our study on social influence
finds that users in whrrl.com are more likely to get influenced by friends than
those in last.fm. The experimental results also confirm that our social

physical layer (PHY) based key generation protocols allow two terminals with
correlated observations to generate secret keys with information-theoretical
security. The state of the art, however, still suffers from major limitations,
e.g., low key generation rate, lower entropy of key bits and a high reliance on
node mobility. In this paper, a novel cooperative key generation protocol is
developed to facilitate high-rate key generation in narrowband fading channels,
where two keying nodes extract the phase randomness of the fading channel with
the aid of relay node(s). For the first time, we explicitly consider the effect
of estimation methods on the extraction of secret key bits from the underlying
fading channels and focus on a popular statistical method--maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE). The performance of the cooperative key generation scheme is
extensively evaluated theoretically. We successfully establish both a
theoretical upper bound on the maximum secret key rate from mutual information
of correlated random sources and a more practical upper bound from Cramer-Rao

Languages for modelling such domains should let the programmer explicitly
define the sharing among objects or expressions. A DSL compiler may find other
identical expressions and share them, implicitly. Such common subexpression
elimination is crucial to the efficient implementation of DSLs. Sharing is
tricky in embedded DSL, since host aliasing may correspond to copying of the
underlying objects rather than their sharing.
  This tutorial summarizes discussions of implementing sharing in Haskell DSLs
for automotive embedded systems and hardware description languages. The
technique has since been used in a Haskell SAT solver and the DSL for music
synthesis. We demonstrate the embedding in pure Haskell of a simple DSL with a
language form for explicit sharing. The DSL also has implicit sharing,
implemented via hash-consing. Explicit sharing greatly speeds up hash-consing.
The seemingly imperative nature of hash-consing is hidden beneath a simple

potentially infinite nonempty sequences of states. The interpreters assign

trace is finite if the program is terminating and infinite if the program is
non-terminating. However, we cannot decide (i.e., write a program to

$\sim$ 40 keV as the source leaves the quiescent state toward the low hard
state. This fits into a scenario in which the corona is cooled by the soft
X-rays along the outburst evolution, as observed in several other atoll
sources. By using the flux measured in the 1.5--30 keV band of the type-I
bursts during the outburst, we find that the linear relationship between the
burst duration and the flux still holds for those bursts that occur at the
decaying part of the low hard state, but with a different slope than the
overall one that was estimated with the bursts happening in the whole extent
of, and for the rest of the low hard state. The significance of such a
dichotomy in the type-I X-ray bursts is $\sim$ 3 $\sigma$ under an F-test.
Similar results are hinted at as well with the broader energy-band that was
adopted recently. This dichotomy may be understood in a scenario where part of
the accreting material forms a corona on the way of falling onto the surface of
the neutron star during the decaying part of the low hard state. Based on the
accretion rates of the preceding LHS, estimated from type-I X-ray bursts and
from persistent emission, at least for IGR J17473-2721, most of the accretion
material may fall on the neutron star (NS) surface in the LHS. Considering the
burst behavior in the context of the outburst indicates a corona formed on top
of the disk rather than on the NS surface.

We devised an algorithm to select a few paths for each source-destination pair

balanced load in the sense that the maximum link utilization is comparable to
that of ECMP forwarding. When the constraint of only shortest paths (i.e. equal

a finite group. In a previous work, the authors defined what it means for a
connected reductive $k$-group $G$ to be ""parascopic"" for $(\tilde{G},\Gamma)$.
Roughly, this is a simultaneous generalization of several settings. For
example, $\Gamma$ could act on $\tilde{G}$, and $G$ could be the connected part
of the group of $\Gamma$-fixed points in $\tilde{G}$. Or $G$ could be an
endoscopic group, a pseudo-Levi subgroup, or an isogenous image of $\tilde{G}$.
If $G$ is such a group, and both $\tilde{G}$ and $G$ are $k$-quasisplit, then
we constructed a map $\hat{\mathcal{N}}^{\text{st}}$ from the set of stable
semisimple conjugacy classes in the dual $G^\wedge(k)$ to the set of such
classes in $\tilde{G}^\wedge(k)$. When $k$ is finite, this implies a lifting
from packets of representations of $G(k)$ to those of $\tilde{G}(k)$.
  In order to understand such a lifting better, here we describe two ways in
which $\hat{\mathcal{N}}^{\text{st}}$ can be made more explicit. First, we can
express our map in the general case in terms of simpler cases. We do so by
showing that $\hat{\mathcal{N}}^{\text{st}}$ is compatible with isogenies and
with Weil restriction, and also by expressing it as a composition of simpler
maps. Second, in many cases we can construct an explicit $k$-morphism $\hat N
\colon G^\wedge \longrightarrow \tilde{G}^\wedge$ that agrees with
$\hat{\mathcal{N}}^{\text{st}}$. As a consequence, our lifting of
representations is seen to coincide with Shintani lifting in some important
cases.

important physical questions for these systems involve thermodynamics. With
this motivation, in this work, we study the statistical thermodynamics of two
one dimensional {\em polymer} quantum systems: an ensemble of oscillators that
describe a solid and a bunch of non-interacting particles in a box, which thus
form an ideal gas. We first study the spectra of these polymer systems. It
turns out useful for the analysis to consider the length scale required by the
quantization and which we shall refer to as polymer length. The dynamics of the
polymer oscillator can be given the form of that for the standard quantum
pendulum. Depending on the dominance of the polymer length we can distinguish
two regimes: vibrational and rotational. The first occur for small polymer
length and here the standard oscillator in Schr\""odinger quantization is
recovered at leading order. The second one, for large polymer length, features
dominant polymer effects. In the case of the polymer particles in the box, a
bounded and oscillating spectrum that presents a band structure and a Brillouin
zone is found. The thermodynamical quantities calculated with these spectra
have corrections with respect to standard ones and they depend on the polymer
length. For generic polymer length, thermodynamics of both systems present an

very puzzling blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 5253, obtained with the ATCA as
part of the `Local Volume HI Survey' (LVHIS). Our low-resolution HI maps show
the disturbed HI morphology that NGC 5253 possesses, including tails, plumes
and detached HI clouds. The high-resolution map reveals an HI plume at the SE
and an HI structure at the NW that surrounds an Ha shell. We confirm that the
kinematics of the neutral gas are highly perturbed and do not follow a rotation
pattern. We discuss the outflow and infall scenarios to explain such disturbed
kinematics, analyze the environment in which it resides, and compare it
properties with those observed in similar star-forming dwarf galaxies. The
radio-continuum emission of NGC 5253 is resolved and associated with the
intense star-forming region at the center of the galaxy. We complete the
analysis using multiwavelength data extracted from the literature. We estimate
the SFR using this multiwavelength approach. NGC 5253 does not satisfy the
Schmidt-Kennicutt law of star-formation, has a very low HI mass-to-light ratio
when comparing with its stellar mass, and seems to be slightly metal-deficient
in comparison with starbursts of similar baryonic mass. Taking into account all
available multiwavelength data, we conclude that NGC 5253 is probably
experiencing the infall of a diffuse, low-metallicity HI cloud along the minor
axis of the galaxy, which is comprising the ISM and triggering the powerful
starburst. The tidally disturbed material observed at the east and north of the
galaxy is a consequence of this interaction, which probably started more than
100 Myr ago. The origin of this HI cloud may be related with a strong
interaction between NGC 5253 and the late-type spiral galaxy M 83 in the past.

probability distribution on the inputs, can one find, possibly small,
collections of input nodes that determine the states of most other nodes in the
network? To answer this question, a notion that quantifies the determinative
power of an input over the states of the nodes in the network is needed. We
argue that the mutual information (MI) between a given subset of the inputs X =
{X_1, ..., X_n} of some node i and its associated function f_i(X) quantifies
the determinative power of this set of inputs over node i. We compare the
determinative power of a set of inputs to the sensitivity to perturbations to
these inputs, and find that, maybe surprisingly, an input that has large
sensitivity to perturbations does not necessarily have large determinative
power. However, for unate functions, which play an important role in genetic
regulatory networks, we find a direct relation between MI and sensitivity to

logistic model for repurchase the entire product lifecycle of a durable can be
established. For the case of a fast growing supply the model suggests that the
mean price of the good decreases according to a logistic law. Both, the
established unit sales and price evolution are in agreement with the empirical
data studied in this paper. The presented approach discusses further the
interference of the diffusion process with the supply dynamics. The model
predicts the occurrence of lost sales in the initial stages of the lifecycle

penetration. The theory suggests that the imitation rate B indicating social

bright limbs coincide spatially in various bands, they have different
brightness, and the contrast of brightness varies from radio to gamma-rays. The
reasons of such properties and the role of the magnetic field strength are
discussed. Simple, almost model-independent methods and analytical
approximations for the derivation of the strength of magnetic field from the
comparison of radio, X-rays and TeV images of SNR are presented. The methods
require the TeV image to be well resolved and accurate, at least to the level
of the radio and X-ray maps, in order to put reasonable constraints on magnetic
field. If we apply it to the present HESS data, they limit the strength of
magnetic field in limbs of SN1006 to values lower than few hundreds micro
Gauss. If applied to the Fermi-LAT band, the model predicts same position and
same ratio of the surface brightness for GeV photons as for the radio band. We
conclude that TeV and GeV future high-resolution data may be very informative
about the MF of SN1006.

7.5 hrs in the 'B' mode and about 2.2 hrs in the 'Q' mode, on average. Although
the pulsar can switch modes within one pulse, the sub-pulse drift rate changes
with a characteristic time of 1.2 hrs over the course of a 'B' mode. Under the
subbeam carousel model we find the drift-rate changes are produced by a 10%
increase in the average number of subbeams and a 16% increase in the carousel

multiple components in the white-light continuum of stellar flares, including
both a blackbody-like spectrum and a hydrogen recombination spectrum. One of
the most surprising findings is that these two components are anti-correlated

the continuum components with spectra from radiative-hydrodynamic models to
show that continuum veiling gives rise to the measured anti-correlation. This

similar spatially resolved, multiple-component white-light continuum might
appear using analogies to several solar flare phenomena. We also compare the

which justify the Boltzmann formula to yield a unique entropy in statistical

and others are sufficient for the validity of Boltzmann formula. In the third,
by combining the above results, we find a reasonable suggestion from the
sufficient conditions that the potential of gravitational interaction among
microstates of underlying quantum gravity may not diverge to negative infinity
(such as Newtonian gravity) but is bounded below at a finite length scale. In
addition to that, from the necessary condition, the interaction has to be
repulsive within the finite length scale. The length scale should be Planck
size. Thus, quantum gravity may become repulsive at Planck length. Also, a
relation of these suggestions with action integral of gravity at semi-classical
level is given. These suggestions about quantum gravity are universal in the
sense that they are independent of any existing model of quantum gravity.

divided into two stages: (a) an ""ironing"" stage, where the volume-to-area ratio
of the vesicle increases without a significant change in its area; (b) a
stretching stage, where the vesicle grows while remaining essentially
spherical, until it ruptures. We show that the crossover between these two

permeating solutes can be rescaled into a single, theoretically predicted,
universal curve. Such a data collapse is demonstrated for giant unilamellar
POPC vesicles, osmotically swollen due to the permeation of urea, glycerol, or
ethylene glycol. We thereby gain a sensitive measurement of the solutes'
membrane permeability coefficients, finding a concentration-independent
coefficient for urea, while those of glycerol and ethylene glycol are found to
increase with solute concentration. In addition, we use the width of the

important step towards obtaining reliable cluster counts to measure
cosmological parameters. The clusters that we detect behave as expected for a

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe, using the first MAXI/GSC
source catalog surveyed in the 4--10 keV band. The sample consists of 37
non-blazar AGNs at $z=0.002-0.2$, whose identification is highly ($>97%$)
complete. We confirm the trend that the fraction of absorbed AGNs with $N_{\rm
H} > 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ rapidly decreases against luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$),
from 0.73$\pm$0.25 at $L_{\rm X} = 10^{42-43.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to 0.12$\pm0.09$
at $L_{\rm X} = 10^{43.5-45.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The obtained luminosity function
is well fitted with a smoothly connected double power-law model whose indices
are $\gamma_1 = 0.84$ (fixed) and $\gamma_2 = 2.0\pm0.2$ below and above the
break luminosity, $L_{*} = 10^{43.3\pm0.4}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, respectively. While
the result of the MAXI/GSC agrees well with that of HEAO-1 at $L_{\rm X} \gtsim
10^{43.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$, it gives a larger number density at the lower
luminosity range. Comparison between our luminosity function in the 2--10 keV
band and that in the 14--195 keV band obtained from the Swift/BAT survey
indicates that the averaged broad band spectra in the 2--200 keV band should
depend on luminosity, approximated by $\Gamma\sim1.7$ for $L_{\rm X} \ltsim
10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ while $\Gamma\sim 2.0$ for $L_{\rm X} \gtsim 10^{44}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. This trend is confirmed by the correlation between the luminosities
in the 2--10 keV and 14--195 keV bands in our sample. We argue that there is no
contradiction in the luminosity functions between above and below 10 keV once
this effect is taken into account.

prove that this symmetry is a necessary condition for a single multiphoton

EIT(Electromagnetically Induced Transparency) systems that show cases of this
symmetry.The above process has the possibility of leading to strong sources of
temporally entangled photons of different frequency. For cases that do not show
this symmetry,more than one ""species"" of multiphoton processes can take place
and each one is visible in one field only. When there is a symmetry, we predict
cross field noise correlations for the scattered fields.Cross field noise
correlations have recently been seen in a different situation that can provide
interesting variation to our study,namely the generated fields in FWM(Four Wave
Mixing). We postulate or conjecture the existence of two types of asymmetric
multiphoton processes.We show only one of these is possible. One of systems we
use for this purpose generates a $\chi^{(9)}$ absorption resonance that is
observable on the same trace that shows linear features, in an experiment
described in a previous work but the order of nonlinearity newly interpreted
using this work.This high order nonlinearity should be very sensitive to cross
field correlations.We show how it can be used to test our conjecture of
asymmetric processes.
  We also come across an important $\chi^{(5)}$ absorption,comparable to linear
absorption, that is anomalous.The anomaly is that the Imaginary part of this
XPM nonlinearity can cause squeezing.We give a qualitative argument which shows
that we don't expect the Imaginary part of the XPM nonlinearities we usually
come across, to cause squeezing.This promising source of squeezing, is
qualitatively different from the other sources hitherto known.

of ~100 ks each.Data from XIS and HXD/PIN instruments,going from 0.5 to 60
keV,represent the highest spectral resolution simultaneous broad-band X-ray
spectrum for these objects.We fitted the broad-band spectrum of both sources
with a double Comptonisation model,adding neutral reflection from distant
material and a two-phase warm absorber.We then studied the two competing models
developed to explain the soft excess in terms of atomic processes:a blurred
ionised disc reflection and an ionised absorption by a high velocity
material.When fitting the data in the 3-10 keV range with a power law
spectrum,and extrapolating this result to low energies,a soft excess is clearly
observed below 2 keV:its strength is however weak compared to previous
observations of both sources.A moderate hard excess is seen at energies greater
than 10 keV,together with a neutral Fe K_a narrow emission line at E~6.4 keV
and a broad Fe emission line.For Mrk509,the broad Fe emission line is required
in all the three physical models in order to have a good fit to the data:this
finding suggests that the blurred reflection model correctly describes the soft
excess,but that it underestimates the broad Fe emission line.For the smeared
absorption model,this suggests instead that the continuum spectrum absorbed by
the outflowing gas should contain indeed a reflected component.For Mrk841,all
three models that we tested provide a good fit to the data,and we cannot
invalidate any of them.A broad emission line is required in the double
Comptonisation and smeared absorption models,while the blurred reflection model
consistently fits the broad-band spectrum,without adding any extra
emission-line component.

  Results: We present BitSeq (Bayesian Inference of Transcripts from Sequencing

RNA-seq experiments. Inferred relative expression is represented by Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples from the posterior probability distribution of
a generative model of the read data. We propose a novel method for differential
expression analysis across replicates which propagates uncertainty from the
sample-level model while modelling biological variance using an
expression-level-dependent prior. We demonstrate the advantages of our method
using simulated data as well as an RNA-seq dataset with technical and
biological replication for both studied conditions.

Ca doping. The Cu bond valence sum calculation provided new evidence for the
charge transfer from the chains to ladders (approximately 0.16 holes per Cu
from x=0 to 12.2). The charge transfer was attributed to two different
mechanisms: (a) the Cu-O bond distance shrinkage on the ladder; (b) increase of
the interaction between two sublattices, resulting in Cu-O bonding between the

asteroseismic analysis of over 500 solar-type pulsating stars observed by the
Kepler space telescope. These physical stellar properties are compared with
those given in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC), determined from ground-based
multi-color photometry. For the stars in our sample, we find general agreement
but we detect an average overestimation bias of 0.23 dex in the KIC
determination of log (g) for stars with log (g)_KIC > 4.0 dex, and a resultant
underestimation bias of up to 50% in the KIC radii estimates for stars with
R_KIC < 2 R sun. Part of the difference may arise from selection bias in the
asteroseismic sample; nevertheless, this result implies there may be fewer
stars characterized in the KIC with R ~ 1 R sun than is suggested by the
physical properties in the KIC. Furthermore, if the radius estimates are taken
from the KIC for these affected stars and then used to calculate the size of
transiting planets, a similar underestimation bias may be applied to the
planetary radii.

waves for solutions to the 1-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations
with density-dependent viscosities for general initial data whose far fields
are connected by a rarefaction wave to the corresponding Euler equations with
one end state being vacuum.
  First, a global-in-time weak solution around the rarefaction wave is
constructed by approximating the system and regularizing the initial data with
general perturbations, and some a priori uniform-in-time estimates for the
energy and entropy are obtained. Then it is shown that the density of any weak
solution satisfying the natural energy and entropy estimates will converge to
the rarefaction wave connected to vacuum with arbitrary strength in super-norm
time-asymptotically. Our results imply, in particular, that the initial vacuum
at far fields will remain for all the time which are in contrast to the case of
non-vacuum rarefaction waves studied in \cite{JWX} where all the possible
vacuum states will vanish in finite time. Finally, it is proved that the weak
solution becomes regular away from the vacuum region of the rarefaction wave.

J1713.7-3946 that includes a hydrodynamic simulation of the remnant evolution
coupled to the efficient production of cosmic rays (CRs) by nonlinear diffusive
shock acceleration (DSA). High-energy CRs that escape from the forward shock
(FS) are propagated in surrounding dense material that simulates either a
swept-up, pre-supernova shell or a nearby molecular cloud. The continuum
emission from trapped and escaping CRs, along with the thermal X-ray emission
from the shocked heated ISM behind the FS, integrated over the remnant, is
compared against broadband observations. Our results show conclusively that,
overall, the GeV-TeV emission is dominated by inverse-Compton from CR electrons
if the supernova is isolated regardless of its type, i.e., not interacting with
a >>100 Msun shell or cloud. If the SNR is interacting with a much larger mass
>10^4 Msun, pion-decay from the escaping CRs may dominate the TeV emission,
although a precise fit at high energy will depend on the still uncertain
details of how the highest energy CRs are accelerated by, and escape from, the
FS. Based on morphological and other constraints, we consider the 10^4 Msun
pion-decay scenario highly unlikely for SNR RX J1713.7-3946 regardless of the
details of CR escape. Importantly, even though CR electrons dominate the
GeV-TeV emission, the efficient production of CR ions is an essential part of
our leptonic model.

vision applications. Object detection in a video is usually performed by object
detectors or background subtraction techniques. Often, an object detector
requires manually labeled examples to train a binary classifier, while
background subtraction needs a training sequence that contains no objects to
build a background model. To automate the analysis, object detection without a
separate training phase becomes a critical task. People have tried to tackle
this task by using motion information. But existing motion-based methods are
usually limited when coping with complex scenarios such as nonrigid motion and
dynamic background. In this paper, we show that above challenges can be
addressed in a unified framework named DEtecting Contiguous Outliers in the
LOw-rank Representation (DECOLOR). This formulation integrates object detection
and background learning into a single process of optimization, which can be
solved by an alternating algorithm efficiently. We explain the relations
between DECOLOR and other sparsity-based methods. Experiments on both simulated
data and real sequences demonstrate that DECOLOR outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches and it can work effectively on a wide range of
complex scenarios.

traditional DFT+U approximation, particularly because of its ability to take
into account dynamical effects, such as the time-resolved double occupancy of
the electronic orbitals. It was recently shown that this approach can also be
successfully applied to study correlation effects in nanostructures. Here, we
present a brief review of the recently proposed generalizations of the DFT+DMFT
method. In particular, we discuss in details our recently proposed DFT+DMFT
approach to study the magnetic properties of nanosystems [V. Turkowski, A.
Kabir, N. Nayyar and T. S Rahman, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter (Fast Track) 22,
462202 (2010)] and present its application to small (up to five atoms) Fe and
FePt clusters. We demonstrate that being a mean-field approach, DMFT produces
meaningful results even for such small systems. We compare our results with
those obtained using DFT+U and find that, as in the case of bulk systems, the
latter approach tends to overestimate correlation effects in nanostructures.
Finally, we discuss possible ways to farther improve the nano-DFT+DMFT
approximation and to extend its application to molecules and nanoparticles on
substrates and to nonequilibrium phenomena.

multiple populations of 47 Tuc, combining high-precision photometry with
calculations of synthetic spectra. Using filters covering a wide range of
wavelengths, our HST photometry splits the main sequence (MS) into two
branches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant and
red-giant regions (SGB, RGB), and on the horizontal branch (HB). We calculate
theoretical stellar atmospheres for MS stars, assuming different chemical
composition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the HST
filters with our observed colors. We find that we can match the complex of
observed colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance and
another with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but with
depleted C and O. We confirm that models of RGB and red HB stars with that pair
of compositions also give colors that fit our observations. We suggest that the
different strengths of molecular bands of OH, CN, CH and NH, falling in
different photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the two
populations. Near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of the
stars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirts
of the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. Thus the
second, He/N-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes the
majority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. We present evidence
that the CMD of 47 Tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the two
populations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the MS
up to the RGB, and thence to the HB. A third population is visible only in the
SGB, where it includes ~8% of the stars.

such systems demonstrates a collective plasmon mode when the number of atoms is
larger than approximately 10, and this mode splits into two peaks when the Au

peak with a local plasmonic mode which corresponds to the charge oscillations
around the potential created by the d-orbitals of the impurity atoms. The
effect takes place when the number of TM atoms is much smaller than the number
of Au atoms. This behavior is opposite to the case of larger bulk
noble-metal-TM clusters (radius $>$1nm), where the doping with TM atoms does
not lead to any generation of additional modes, and often leads to a
suppression of the main plasmon peak. This phenomenon of tuning the optical
properties of nanosystems with transition metal atoms can be used in many
practical applications in the field of nanotechnology.

iff $\neg \omega\wedge \bigwedge_{i=1}^z \Phi_i$ is unsatisfiable.
  Now assume that, given integers $0\leq e_i < u(i)$, we must check if $\neg

$\Phi'_i\subseteq \Phi_i$ is obtained by deleting $\,\,e_{i}$ arbitrarily
chosen formulas of $\Phi_i$, for each $i=1,...,z.$
  Intuitively, does $\omega$ {\it stably} follow, after removing $e_i$ random
formulas from each $\Phi_i$?
  We construct a quadratic reduction of this problem to the consequence problem

ranking of Wikipedia articles in search engines is justified by the quality of
the articles. After an overview of current research on information quality in
Wikipedia, a summary of the extended discussion on the quality of encyclopedic
entries in general is given. On this basis, a heuristic method for evaluating
Wikipedia entries is developed and applied to Wikipedia articles that scored
highly in a search engine retrieval effectiveness test and compared with the
relevance judgment of jurors. In all search engines tested, Wikipedia results
are unanimously judged better by the jurors than other results on the
corresponding results position. Relevance judgments often roughly correspond
with the results from the heuristic evaluation. Cases in which high relevance
judgments are not in accordance with the comparatively low score from the
heuristic evaluation are interpreted as an indicator of a high degree of trust
in Wikipedia. One of the systemic shortcomings of Wikipedia lies in its
necessarily incoherent user model. A further tuning of the suggested criteria
catalogue, for instance the different weighing of the supplied criteria, could
serve as a starting point for a user model differentiated evaluation of
Wikipedia articles. Approved methods of quality evaluation of reference works
are applied to Wikipedia articles and integrated with the question of search
engine evaluation.

exchange potentials, which sum up to the screened nonlocal exchange potential
of HSE. We evaluate the former with the help of an auxiliary basis, defined in
such a way that the bare Coulomb matrix becomes sparse. The latter is computed
in reciprocal space, exploiting its fast convergence behavior in reciprocal
space. This approach is general and can be applied to a whole class of screened
hybrid functionals. We obtain excellent agreement of band gaps and lattice
constants for prototypical semiconductors and insulators with
electronic-structure calculations using plane-wave or Gaussian basis sets. We
apply the HSE hybrid functional to examine the ground-state properties of
rocksalt GdN, which have been controversially discussed in literature. Our
results indicate that there is a half-metal to insulator transition occurring

archive data. The soft X-ray (0.5-2 keV) emission of most of the galaxies
(>80%), including LIRGs hosting a Seyfert 2 nucleus, is dominated by
star-formation related processes. These LIRGs follow the star-formation rate
(SFR) versus soft X-ray luminosity correlation observed in local starbursts. We
find that ~15% of the non-Seyfert LIRGs (3 out of 20) have an excess hard X-ray
emission relative to that expected from star-formation that might indicate the
presence of an obscured AGN. The rest of the non-Seyfert LIRGs follow the SFR
versus hard X-ray (2-10 keV) luminosity correlation of local starbursts. The
non-detection of the 6.4 keV Fe K alpha emission line in the non-Seyfert LIRGs
allows us to put an upper limit to the bolometric luminosity of an obscured
AGN, L_bol <1043 erg s-1 . That is, in these galaxies, if they hosted a low
luminosity AGN, its contribution to total luminosity would be less than 10%.
Finally we estimate that the AGN contribution to the total luminosity for our

momentum and the stellar spin is usually constrained through the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect observed in radial velocity and can be subject to
large uncertainties, especially for hot stars (T_eff > 6250 K). It is thus
interesting to have an alternative method to constrain the value of the
obliquity and to detect companions that might have disturbed the orbit of the
planet. We show how the long-term variations in the transit duration (TDV) can
be used to constrain the obliquity of the stellar rotation axis. We introduce a
simple theory to express the secular variations in the orbital elements and
their effects on the TDVs with a general formulation valid for both oblique and
eccentric systems. Parameters or orbital elements that cannot be directly
measured, such as the longitude of the ascending node of the orbit, are avoided
thus allowing us a straightforward application. We compute the expected TDVs
for the presently known transiting systems, adopting their parameters found in
the literature. Considering the capabilities of the present or next generation
space-borne telescopes, we point out the systems that could be readily observed
and discuss the constraints derivable on their fundamental parameters. TDVs can
be used to constrain the obliquity of the stars (and possibly of the planets in
systems younger than 10 -- 100 Myr), giving information about the formation
scenarios, the strength of the tidal coupling, and the internal structure of
both the stars and the planets. Moreover, they can provide an indirect
indication of the presence of other bodies, even with a mass comparable with
that of the Earth, because they give rise to additional contributions to the

the complexity of networks. Most of these entropy measures apply to static

paper we define the entropy rate of growing network models. This entropy rate
quantifies how many labeled networks are typically generated by the growing
network models. We analytically evaluate the difference between the entropy
rate of growing tree network models and the entropy of tree networks that have
the same asymptotic degree distribution. We find that the growing networks with
linear preferential attachment generated by dynamical models are exponentially
less than the static networks with the same degree distribution for a large
variety of relevant growing network models. We study the entropy rate for
growing network models showing structural phase transitions including models
with non-linear preferential attachment. Finally, we bring numerical evidence
that the entropy rate above and below the structural phase transitions follow a
different scaling with the network size.

simple assumptions on interest rates the well-known debt dynamics equation
transforms into the infamous logistic map. The logistic map has very peculiar

butterfly effect which in turn is qualitatively very important, as it shows
that even deterministic budget rules produce unpredictable behaviour of the
debt-to-GDP ratio, as chaotic systems are extremely sensitive to initial

completely integrable action of a torus T on an open dense subset of a
coadjoint orbit of the unitary group. We then identify a proper Hamiltonian
T-manifold centered around a point in the dual of the Lie algebra of T. A
theorem of Karshon and Tolman says that such a manifold is equivariantly
symplectomorphic to a particular subset of R^2D. This fact enables us to
construct symplectic embeddings of balls into certain coadjoint orbits of the
unitary group, and therefore obtain a lower bound for their Gromov width. Using
the identification of the dual of the Lie algebra of the unitary group with the
space of (n x n) Hermitian matrices, the main theorem states that for a
coadjoint orbit through \lambda=diag(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n) in the dual of
the Lie algebra of the unitary group, where at most one eigenvalue is repeated,
the lower bound for Gromov width is equal to the minimum of the differences
\lambda_i-\lambda_j, over all \lambda_i>\lambda_j. For a generic orbit (i.e.
with distinct \lambda_i's), with additional integrality conditions, this
minimum has been proved to be exactly the Gromov width of the orbit. For
nongeneric orbits this lower bound is new.

with particular attention to possible non-Gaussian features, accurate formulae
for the bispectrum and the bispectrum covariance are required. The bispectrum
is the lowest-order statistic providing an estimate for non-Gaussianities of a
distribution, and the bispectrum covariance depicts the errors of the
bispectrum measurement and their correlation on different scales. Currently,
there do exist fitting formulae for the bispectrum and an analytical expression
for the bispectrum covariance, but the former is not very accurate and the
latter contains several intricate terms and only one of them can be readily
evaluated from the power spectrum of the studied field. Neglecting all
higher-order terms results in the Gaussian approximation of the bispectrum
covariance. We study the range of validity of this Gaussian approximation for
two-dimensional non-Gaussian random fields. For this purpose, we simulate
Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields, the latter represented by log-normal
fields and obtained directly from the former by a simple transformation. From
the simulated fields, we calculate the power spectra, the bispectra, and the
covariance from the sample variance of the bispectra, for different degrees of
non-Gaussianity \alpha, which is equivalent to the skewness on a given angular
scale \theta g. We find that the Gaussian approximation provides a good
approximation for \alpha<0.6 and a reasonably accurate approximation for
\alpha< 1, both on scales >8\theta g. Using results from cosmic shear
simulations, we estimate that the cosmic shear convergence fields are described
by \alpha<0.7 at \theta g~4"". We therefore conclude that the Gaussian
approximation for the bispectrum covariance is likely to be applicable in
ongoing and future cosmic shear studies.

Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT) show significant breaks in their spectra at a few
GeV. The sharpness and the position of the breaks can be well reproduced by
absorption of $\gamma$-rays via photon--photon pair production on He ii and H i
Lyman recombination continua (LyC) produced in the broad-line region (BLR).
Using 138 weeks of LAT observations of the brightest GeV blazar 3C 454.3 we
find a power-law dependence of the peak energy on flux and discover
anti-correlation between flux and the column density of the He ii LyC which is
responsible for absorption of the >2.5 GeV photons in this object. The strength
and the variability of the absorption implies the location of the gamma-ray
emitting zone close to the boundary of the high-ionization part of the BLR and
moving away from the black hole when the flux increases. A combination of the
GeV breaks with the detection of a few powerful blazars in the TeV range puts
strong constraints on the BLR size. Additional spectral breaks at ~100 and ~400
GeV due to absorption by the Balmer and Paschen lines could be detected by the
Cherenkov Telescope Array.

coherence among stock prices. It is verified that during financial crisis a
synchronous state emerges in the system, defining the market's direction.
Furthermore, the paper proposes a statistical regression model able to identify
the topological features that mostly influence such an emergence. The
coefficients of the proposed model indicate that the average shortest path
length is the measurement most related to network synchronization. Therefore,
during economic crisis, the stock prices present a similar evolution, which
