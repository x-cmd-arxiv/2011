Phys. 103:895-918, 2013",,,"math-ph hep-th math.AG math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  BPS invariants are computed, capturing topological invariants of moduli
spaces of semi-stable sheaves on rational surfaces. For a suitable stability
condition, it is proposed that the generating function of BPS invariants of a
Hirzebruch surface takes the form of a product formula. BPS invariants for
other stability conditions and other rational surfaces are obtained using
Harder-Narasimhan filtrations and the blow-up formula. Explicit expressions are
given for rank <4 sheaves on a Hirzebruch surface or the projective plane. The
applied techniques can be applied iteratively to compute invariants for higher
rank.

low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) obtained by VLT/VISIR is

emission of LLAGN is consistent with the existence of a dusty obscuring torus.
A sample of 17 nearby LLAGN was selected and combined with archival VISIR data
of 9 additional LLAGN with available X-ray measurements. Of the 17 observed
LLAGN, 7 are detected, while upper limits are derived for the 10
non-detections. All detections except NGC 3125 appear point-like on a spatial
scale of \sim 0.35"". The detections do not significantly deviate from the known
MIR-X-ray correlation but extend it by a factor of \sim 10 down to luminosities
< 10^41 erg/s with a narrow scatter. The latter is dominated by the
uncertainties in the X-ray luminosity. Interestingly, a similar correlation
with comparable slope but with a normalization differing by \sim 2.6 orders of
magnitude has been found for local starburst galaxies. In addition, the VISIR
data are compared with lower spatial resolution data from Spitzer/IRS and IRAS.
By using a scaled starburst template SED and the PAH 11.3 \mum emission line
the maximum nuclear star formation contamination to the VISIR photometry is
restricted to < 30% for 75% of the LLAGN. Exceptions are NGC 1097 and NGC 1566,
which may possess unresolved strong PAH emission. Furthermore, within the
uncertainties the MIR-X-ray luminosity ratio is unchanged over more than 4
orders of magnitude in accretion rate. These results are consistent with the
existence of the dusty torus in all observed LLAGN, although the jet or
accretion disk as origin of the MIR emission cannot be excluded. Finally, the
fact that the MIR-X-ray correlation holds for all LLAGN and Seyferts makes it a
very useful empirical tool for converting between the MIR and X-ray powers of
these nuclei.

A map $D: \R^\R \to \R^\R$ is a {\it difference operator}, if there are real
numbers $a_i, b_i \ (i=1,..., n)$ such that $(Df)(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i f(x+b_i)$
for every $f\in \R^\R $ and $x\in \R$. A {\it system of difference equations}
is a set of equations $S={D_i f=g_i : i\in I}$, where $I$ is an arbitrary set
of indices, $D_i$ is a difference operator and $g_i$ is a given function for
every $i\in I$, and $f$ is the unknown function. One can prove that a system
$S$ is solvable if and only if every finite subsystem of $S$ is solvable.
However, if we look for solutions belonging to a given class of functions, then
the analogous statement fails. For example, there exists a system $S$ such that
every finite subsystem of $S$ has a solution which is a trigonometric
polynomial, but $S$ has no such solution.
  This phenomenon motivates the following definition. Let ${\cal F}$ be a class
of functions. The {\it solvability cardinal} $\solc (\iF)$ of ${\cal F}$ is the
smallest cardinal $\kappa$ such that whenever $S$ is a system of difference
equations and each subsystem of $S$ of cardinality less than $\kappa$ has a
solution in ${\cal F}$, then $S$ itselfhas a solution in ${\cal F}$. In this
paper we determine the solvability cardinals of most function classes that
occur in analysis. As it turns out, the behaviour of $\solc ({\cal F})$ is
rather erratic. For example, $\solc (\text{polynomials})=3$ but $\solc
(\text{trigonometric polynomials})=\omega_1$, $\solc ({f: f\ \text{is
continuous}}) = \omega_1$ but $\solc ({f: f\ \text{is Darboux}})
=(2^\omega)^+$, and $\solc (\R^\R)=\omega$. We consistently determine the
solvability cardinals of the classes of Borel, Lebesgue and Baire measurable
functions, and give some partial answers for the Baire class 1 and Baire class
$\alpha$ functions.

Pearl length $\Lambda = 2 \lambda^2/d$. We define the critical current as the
current that reduces the Gibbs free-energy barrier to zero. We show that
current crowding, which occurs whenever the current rounds a sharp turn, tends
to reduce the critical current, but we also show that when the radius of
curvature is less than the coherence length this effect is partially
compensated by a radius-of-curvature effect. We propose several patterns with
rounded corners to avoid critical-current reduction due to current crowding.

the discovery of high-redshift galaxies in recent years. Hence, it is crucial
to study the radiative transfer of both Lya and continuum photons in the
context of galaxy formation and evolution in order to understand the nature of
distant galaxies. Here, we present a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code, All-wavelength Radiative Transfer with Adaptive Refinement Tree
(ART^2), which couples Lya line and multi-wavelength continuum, for the study
of panchromatic properties of galaxies and interstellar medium. This code is
based on the original version of Li et al., and features three essential
modules: continuum emission from X-ray to radio, Lya emission from both
recombination and collisional excitation, and ionization of neutral hydrogen.
The coupling of these three modules, together with an adaptive refinement grid,
enables a self-consistent and accurate calculation of the Lya properties. As an
example, we apply ART^2 to a cosmological simulation that includes both star
formation and black hole growth, and study in detail a sample of massive
galaxies at redshifts z=3.1 - 10.2. We find that these galaxies are Lya
emitters (LAEs), whose Lya emission traces the dense gas region, and that their
Lya lines show a shape characteristic of gas inflow. Furthermore, the Lya
properties, including photon escape fraction, emergent luminosity, and
equivalent width, change with time and environment. Our results suggest that
LAEs evolve with redshift, and that early LAEs such as the most distant one
detected at z ~ 8.6 may be dwarf galaxies with a high star formation rate
fueled by infall of cold gas, and a low Lya escape fraction.

Initially a space-spanning network is formed that for a characteristic time,

behavior persists only for a limited time. Gels whose age $\tw$ is greater than

spectra of both hotspot regions are well fitted by a synchrotron model with
steep spectral indices ~0.8 and break frequencies 10^12-10^14 Hz. 3C105 South
is resolved in two optical components: a primary one, aligned with the jet
direction and possibly marking the first jet impact with the surrounding
medium, and a secondary, further out from the jet and extended in a direction
perpendicular to it. This secondary region is interpreted as a splatter-spot
formed by the deflection of relativistic plasma from the primary hotspot. Radio
and optical images of 3C445 South show a spectacular 10-kpc arc-shape structure
characterized by two main components, and perpendicular to the jet direction.
HST images in I and B bands further resolve the brightest components into thin
elongated features. In both 3C105 South and 3C445 South the main hotspot
components are enshrouded by diffuse optical emission on scale of several kpcs,
indicating that very high energy particles, possibly injected at strong shocks,
are continuously re-accelerated in situ by additional acceleration mechanisms.

proposed a self-calibration technique for the power spectrum to calculate the
induced gravitational shear-galaxy intrinsic ellipticity correlation (GI) in
weak lensing surveys with photo-z measurements which is expected to reduce the
IA contamination by at least a factor of 10 for currently proposed surveys. We
confirm this using an independent analysis and propose an expansion to the
self-calibration technique for the bispectrum in order to calculate the
dominant IA gravitational shear-gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity
correlation (GGI) contamination. We first establish an estimator to extract the
galaxy density-density-intrinsic ellipticity (ggI) correlation from the galaxy
ellipticity-density-density measurement for a photo-z galaxy sample. We then
develop a relation between the GGI and ggI bispectra, which allows for the
estimation and removal of the GGI correlation from the cosmic shear signal. We
explore the performance of these two methods, compare to other possible sources
of error, and show that the GGI self-calibration technique can potentially
reduce the IA contamination by up to a factor of 5-10 for all but a few bin
choices, thus reducing the contamination to the percent level. The
self-calibration is less accurate for adjacent bins, but still allows for a
factor of three reduction in the IA contamination. The self-calibration thus
promises to be an efficient technique to isolate both the 2-point and 3-point
intrinsic alignment signals from weak lensing measurements.

2009, 2010 and 2011. Dedicated upgrades of the CNGS timing system and of the
OPERA detector, as well as a high precision geodesy campaign for the
measurement of the neutrino baseline, allowed reaching comparable systematic
and statistical accuracies. An arrival time of CNGS muon neutrinos with respect
to the one computed assuming the speed of light in vacuum of (6.5 +/-
7.4(stat.)((+8.3)(-8.0)sys.))ns was measured corresponding to a relative
difference of the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed of light
(v-c)/c =(2.7 +/-3.1(stat.)((+3.4)(-3.3)(sys.))x10^(-6). The above result,
obtained by comparing the time distributions of neutrino interactions and of
protons hitting the CNGS target in 10.5 microseconds long extractions, was
confirmed by a test performed at the end of 2011 using a short bunch beam
allowing to measure the neutrino time of flight at the single interaction

quiver. Full quivers of representations apply especially well to \Zcd\
algebras, which have properties very like those of finite dimensional algebras
over fields. By choosing the representation appropriately, one can restrict the
gluing to two main types: {\it Frobenius} (along the diagonal) and, more
generally {\it proportional} Frobenius gluing (above the diagonal), and our
main result is that any representable algebra has a faithful representation
described completely by such a full quiver. Further reductions are considered,

equation. This paper establishes a result in this direction. After smoothing
the additive noise (by less than one spatial derivative), we establish (almost
sure) local well-posedness of the stochastic KdV-Burgers equation with white
noise as initial data. We also prove a global well-posedness result under an
additional smoothing of the noise.

LOS, separation from galaxies. The median optical depth, and hence the median
density of atomic hydrogen, drops by more than an order of magnitude around 100
kpc, which is similar to the virial radius of the halos thought to host the
galaxies. The median remains enhanced (>3 sigma level) out to at least 2.8 Mpc

covering fraction of gas with Ly-a optical depth greater than unity is
100(+0)(-32)% (86(+14)(-18)%). Absorbers with tau(Ly-a)> 0.1 are typically
closer to galaxies than random. The mean galaxy overdensity around absorbers
increases with the optical depth and also as the length scale over which the
galaxy overdensity is evaluated is decreased. Absorbers with tau(Ly-a)~1 reside
in regions where the galaxy number density is close to the cosmic mean on

scales < 200 km/s, or < 1 Mpc, the absorption is stronger along the LOS than in

redshift errors, but is probably dominated by gas motions within or very close

possible classically but are challenging to build because of their increased
susceptibility to errors. Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and
correct errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting
codes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a
one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single
phase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code
used [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by
encoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all
three qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by
reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a
three-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the
code can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process
should decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the
correcting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional NOT (CCNot) or
Toffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single
qubit, in 63 ns. We find 85\pm1% fidelity to the expected classical action of
this gate and 78\pm1% fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using it,
we perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction
with 76\pm0.5% process fidelity and demonstrate the predicted first-order
insensitivity to errors. Concatenating these two codes and performing them on a
nine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. When combined
with recent advances in superconducting qubit coherence times [5,6], this may
lead to scalable quantum technology.

estimation in multi-agent inference networks. Local sensing model information
is only partially available at the agents and inter-agent communication is
assumed to be unpredictable. The paper develops a generic mixed time-scale
stochastic procedure consisting of simultaneous distributed learning and
estimation, in which the agents adaptively assess their relative observation
quality over time and fuse the innovations accordingly. Under rather weak
assumptions on the statistical model and the inter-agent communication, it is
shown that, by properly tuning the consensus potential with respect to the
innovation potential, the asymptotic information rate loss incurred in the
learning process may be made negligible. As such, it is shown that the agent
estimates are asymptotically efficient, in that their asymptotic covariance
coincides with that of a centralized estimator (the inverse of the centralized
Fisher information rate for Gaussian systems) with perfect global model
information and having access to all observations at all times. The proof
techniques are mainly based on convergence arguments for non-Markovian mixed
time scale stochastic approximation procedures. Several approximation results
developed in the process are of independent interest.

microscopic kinetic equation. We find that the hole spin relaxation time is
typically several tens femtoseconds and can present a nonmonotonic temperature
dependence due to the variation of the interband spin mixing, influenced by the
temperature related Zeeman splitting. With the hole spin relaxation time, we
are able to calculate the coefficients in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation,
such as the Gilbert damping, nonadiabatic spin torque, spin stiffness and
vertical spin stiffness coefficients. We find that the nonadiabatic spin torque
coefficient $\beta$ is around $0.1\sim 0.3$ at low temperature, which is
consistent with the experiment [Adam {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 80},
193204 (2009)]. As the temperature increases, $\beta$ monotonically increases
and can exceed one in the vicinity of the Curie temperature. In the low
temperature regime with $\beta<1$, the Gilbert damping coefficient $\alpha$
increases with temperature, showing good agreement with the experiments [Sinova
{\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 69}, 085209 (2004); Khazen {\em et al.}, {\em
ibid.} {\bf 78}, 195210 (2008)]. Furthermore, we predict that $\alpha$
decreases with increasing temperature once $\beta>1$ near the Curie
temperature. We also find that the spin stiffness decreases with increasing
temperature, especially near the Curie temperature due to the modification of
the finite $\beta$. Similar to the Gilbert damping, the vertical spin stiffness
coefficient is also found to be nonmonotonically dependent on the temperature.

new property, namely the ability to tune the specificity amplification by
changing the reactants concentrations. This contrasts with the classical
kinetic proofreading mechanism in which specificity is a function of only the
reaction rate constants involved in a chemical pathway. These results are also
interesting because they show that a wide class of frustration models exists
that share the same underlining kinetic proofreading mechanisms, with even
richer properties. These models can find applications in different areas such

between two blocks of length $L_A$ and $L_B$, separated by $L$ sites in the one
dimensional spin-1 AKLT model. We took the model with two different boundary
conditions. We consider the case of $N$ spins 1 in the bulk and one spin 1/2 at
each boundary which constitute an unique ground state, and the case of just
spins 1, even at the end of the chain, where the degeneracy of the ground state
is four. In both scenarios we made a partition consisting of two blocks $A$ and
$B$, containing $L_A$ and $L_B$ sites respectively. The separation of these two
blocks is $L$. In both cases we explicitly obtain the reduced density matrix of
the blocks $A$ and $B$. We prove that the negativity in the first case vanishes
identically for $L\geq 1$ while in the second scenario it may approach a
constant value $N=1/2$ for each degenerate eigenstate depending on the way one
constructs these eigenstates. However, as there is some freedom in constructing
these eigenstates, vanishing entanglement is also possible in the latter case.
Additionally, we also compute the entanglement between non-complementary blocks
in the case of periodic boundary conditions for the spin-1 AKLT model for which
there is a unique ground state. Even in this case, we find that the negativity
of separated blocks of spins is zero.

high-level features (i.e. latent semantics) from a large vocabulary of abundant
mid-level features (i.e. visual keywords) with structured sparse
representation, which can help to bridge the semantic gap in the challenging
task of human action recognition. To discover the manifold structure of
midlevel features, we develop a spectral embedding approach to latent semantic
learning based on L1-graph, without the need to tune any parameter for graph
construction as a key step of manifold learning. More importantly, we construct
the L1-graph with structured sparse representation, which can be obtained by
structured sparse coding with its structured sparsity ensured by novel L1-norm
hypergraph regularization over mid-level features. In the new embedding space,
we learn latent semantics automatically from abundant mid-level features
through spectral clustering. The learnt latent semantics can be readily used
for human action recognition with SVM by defining a histogram intersection
kernel. Different from the traditional latent semantic analysis based on topic
models, our latent semantic learning method can explore the manifold structure
of mid-level features in both L1-graph construction and spectral embedding,
which results in compact but discriminative high-level features. The
experimental results on the commonly used KTH action dataset and unconstrained
YouTube action dataset show the superior performance of our method.

approximate integrands over the unit cube $[0,1]^s$ from a weighted reproducing
kernel Hilbert space. We assume that the weights are independent random
variables with a given mean and variance for two reasons stemming from
practical applications: (i) It is usually not known in practice how to choose
the weights. Thus by assuming that the weights are random variables, we obtain
robust constructions (with respect to the weights) of lattice rules. This, to
some extend, removes the necessity to carefully choose the weights. (ii) In
practice it is convenient to use the same lattice rule for many different
integrands. The best choice of weights for each integrand may vary to some
degree, hence considering the weights random variables does justice to how
lattice rules are used in applications.
  We also study a generalized version which uses $r$ constraints which we call
the cbc$r$c (component-by-component with $r$ constraints) algorithm. We show
that lattice rules generated by the cbc$r$c algorithm simultaneously work well
for all weights in a subspace spanned by the chosen weights
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}^{(1)},..., \boldsymbol{\gamma}^{(r)}$. Thus, in
applications, instead of finding one set of weights, it is enough to find an
$r$ dimensional convex polytope in which the optimal weights lie. The price for
this method is a factor $r$ in the upper bound on the error and in the
construction cost of the lattice rule. Thus the burden of determining one set
of weights very precisely can be shifted to the construction of good lattice
rules.

estimation almost entirely focuses on finite or countably infinite mixture
models. We develop approximation results for our class of continuous mixing

originating from LS I +61 303 (although we cannot totally exclude the
improbable presence of a far-away line-of-sight magnetar) and that it is a
different phenomena with respect to the previously-observed ks-long flares from
this system. Accepting as a hypothesis that LS I +61 303 is the first magnetar
detected in a binary system, we study which are the implications. We find that
a magnetar-composed LS I +61 303-system would most likely be (i.e., for usual
magnetar parameters and mass-loss rate) subject to a flip-flop behavior, from a
rotational powered regime (in apastron) to a propeller regime (in periastron)
along each of the LS I +61 303, eccentric orbital motion. We prove that whereas
near apastron an inter-wind shock can lead to the normally observed LS I +61
303behavior, with TeV emission, the periastron propeller is expected to
efficiently accelerate particles only to sub-TeV energies. This flip-flop
scenario would explain the system's behavior where a recurrent TeV emission was
seen appearing near apastron only, the anti-correlation of GeV and TeV
emission, and the long-term TeV variability (which seems correlated to LS I +61
303's super-orbital period), including the appearance of a low TeV-state.
Finally, we qualitatively put the multi-wavelength phenomenology in context of

report on multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations describing the 2010
outburst of V407 Cyg, exploring the first 60 days of evolution. The model takes
into account thermal conduction and radiative cooling; the pre-explosion system
conditions included the companion star and a circumbinary density enhancement.
The simulations showed that the blast and the ejecta distribution are both
aspherical due to the inhomogeneous circumstellar medium in which they expand;
in particular they are significantly collimated in polar directions (producing
a bipolar shock morphology) if the circumstellar envelope is characterized by
an equatorial density enhancement. The blast is partially shielded by the Mira
companion, producing a wake with dense and hot post-shock plasma on the rear
side of the companion star; most of the X-ray emission produced during the
evolution of the blast arises from this plasma structure. The observed X-ray
lightcurve can be reproduced, assuming values of outburst energy and ejected
mass similar to those of RS Oph and U Sco, if a circumbinary gas density
enhancement is included in the model. In this case, the 2010 blast propagated
through a circumbinary gas density enhancement with radius of the order of 40
AU and gas density \approx 10^6 cm^{-3} and the mass of ejecta in the outburst

in more than half of the most energetic color-singlet fragments of

Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez. This generalizes several results from the
literature, because many natural classes of graphs have bounded expansion:
graphs of bounded tree-width, all proper minor-closed classes of graphs, graphs
of bounded degree, graphs with no subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of a
fixed graph, and graphs that can be drawn in a fixed surface in such a way that
each edge crosses at most a constant number of other edges. We deduce that
there is an almost linear-time algorithm for deciding FO properties in classes

  More generally, we design a dynamic data structure for graphs belonging to a
fixed class of graphs of bounded expansion. After a linear-time initialization
the data structure allows us to test an FO property in constant time, and the
data structure can be updated in constant time after addition/deletion of an
edge, provided the list of possible edges to be added is known in advance and
their simultaneous addition results in a graph in the class. All our results

intergalactic medium (IGM). We model the reionization using a radiative
transfer (RT) code coupled to the combined gravity hydrodynamics code Enzo.
Neutral hydrogen and helium are initially ionized by a starburst spectrum,
which is allowed to gradually evolve into a power law spectrum over the
redshift interval 3 < z < 4. The temperature-density relation of the gas is
found to fan out and flatten following HeII reionization, with an inversion for
overdensities above 5. Peculiar velocities of up to 10 km/s are induced by the
increased pressure, with the gas density field distorted over large coherent
regions by 10-20%, and the dark matter by levels of 1%. The
photoionization-induced flows may thus distort the matter power spectrum at
comoving wavenumbers k > 0.5 h/Mpc by a few percent by z = 2. Absorption
spectra for HI and HeII are drawn from the simulations, and absorption lines
are fit to the spectra. A median Doppler parameter of 35 km/s is obtained for
the HI absorption systems at z = 3. Dividing into subsamples optically thick
and optically thin at line centre reveals that the optically thick systems
undergo only mild evolution while the optically thin systems evolve rapidly
following HeII reionization. A comparison between HeII and HI absorption
features shows a broad distribution in the HeII and HI column density ratio,
peaking near the measured value and only slightly narrower than measured. A
comparison with approximate simulation methods shows moderately good agreement
in the absorption line properties, but not to the precision to which they may
be measured.

quasi-equilibrium systems (i.e. in the absence of shear), Classical Nucleation
Theory (CNT) predicts the dependence of the critical cluster size and the
nucleation rate on the external magnetic field. We investigate the behaviour of
the sheared Ising model as a function of the external field. At low exter- nal
field strength, the same nonmonotonic behaviour holds and the peak in the
nucleation rate is remarkably insensitive to the field strength. This suggests
that the same external field-dependence holds for the enhancement of nucleation
by shear at low shear rates and the suppression of shear at high shear rates.
At high field strength, the nucleation behaviour is qualitatively different. We
also analyse the size and shape of the largest cluster in the transition state
configurations, as a function of the external field. In the sheared system, the
transition state cluster becomes larger and more elongated as the field
strength decreases. We compare our results for the sheared system to the

The origin of the scaling law in the laser driven fusion yield is derived in
terms of hydrodynamic scaling. We point out that the scaling properties can be
attributed to the laser power dependence of three terms: the reaction rate, the
density of the plasma and the projected range of the plasma particle in the
target medium. The resulting scaling relations have a predictive power that
enables estimating the fusion yield for a nuclear reaction which has not been

astrometric measurements from the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI). The RVs

telescopes/spectrographs using our novel iodine-cell technique for double-lined
binary stars. The RVs and available PTI astrometric data spanning over 8 years
allow us to reach 0.2-0.5% level of precision in M sin3(i) and the parallax but
the geometry of the orbit (i=154 deg) hampers the absolute mass precision to
3.3%, which is still an order of magnitude better than for previous studies. We
compare our results with a set of Yonsei-Yale theoretical stellar isochrones
and conclude that BY Dra is probably a main sequence system more metal-rich
than the Sun. Using the orbital inclination and the available rotational
velocities of the components, we also conclude that the rotational axes of the
components are likely misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. Given BY
Dra's main sequence status, late spectral type and the relatively short orbital
period, its high orbital eccentricity and probable spin-orbit misalignment are
not in agreement with the tidal theory. This disagreement may possibly be
explained by smaller rotational velocities of the components and the presence
of a substellar mass companion to BY Dra AB.

circularly-polarized spectra from the NARVAL spectropolarimeter between 2007
and 2011, for a total of 76 spectra. Using approximately 6,100 photospheric
spectral lines covering the visible domain, we employed a cross-correlation
procedure to compute a mean polarized line profile from each spectrum. The
large-scale photospheric magnetic field of the star was then modelled by means
of Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, allowing us to follow the year-to-year evolution of
the reconstructed magnetic topology. Simultaneously, we monitored the width of
several magnetically sensitive spectral lines, the radial velocity, the line
asymmetry of intensity line profiles, and the chromospheric emission in the
cores of the Ca II H and Halpha lines. Results. During the highest observed
activity states, in 2007 and 2011, the large-scale field of \xi Boo A is almost
completely axisymmetric and is dominated by its toroidal component. The
magnetic topologies reconstructed for these activity maxima are very similar,
suggesting a form of short cyclicity in the large-scale field distribution.
Correlated temporal evolution, due to both rotational modulation and seasonal
variability, is observed between the Ca II emission, the Halpha emission and
the width of magnetically sensitive lines. When measurable, the differential
rotation reveals a strong latitudinal shear in excess of 0.2 rad/d.

inclusion of a non-equilibrium pressure. The non-equilibrium pressure is

empirical techniques to measure the performance of algorithms in some specific
tasks (e.g., playing chess, solving mazes or land a helicopter). However, these
methods are not appropriate if we want to evaluate the general intelligence of
AI and, even less, if we compare it with human intelligence. The ANYNT project
has designed a new method of evaluation that tries to assess AI systems using
well known computational notions and problems which are as general as possible.
This new method serves to assess general intelligence (which allows us to learn
how to solve any new kind of problem we face) and not only to evaluate
performance on a set of specific tasks. This method not only focuses on
measuring the intelligence of algorithms, but also to assess any intelligent
system (human beings, animals, AI, aliens?,...), and letting us to place their
results on the same scale and, therefore, to be able to compare them. This new
approach will allow us (in the future) to evaluate and compare any kind of
intelligent system known or even to build/find, be it artificial or biological.
This master thesis aims at ensuring that this new method provides consistent
results when evaluating AI algorithms, this is done through the design and
implementation of prototypes of universal intelligence tests and their
application to different intelligent systems (AI algorithms and humans beings).
From the study we analyze whether the results obtained by two different
intelligent systems are properly located on the same scale and we propose
changes and refinements to these prototypes in order to, in the future, being
able to achieve a truly universal intelligence test.

variations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$ [Jansen \emph{et al.}
Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{106}, 100801 (2011)]. The high sensitivity of methanol
originates from the interplay between overall rotation and hindered internal
rotation of the molecule -- i.e. transitions that convert internal rotation
energy into overall rotation energy, or vice versa, give rise to an enhancement
of the sensitivity coefficient, $K_{\mu}$. As internal rotation is a common
phenomenon in polyatomic molecules, it is likely that other molecules display
similar or even larger effects. In this paper we generalize the concepts that
form the foundation of the high sensitivity in methanol and use this to
construct an approximate model which allows to estimate the sensitivities of
transitions in internal rotor molecules with $C_{3v}$ symmetry, without
performing a full calculation of energy levels. We find that a reliable
estimate of transition sensitivities can be obtained from the three rotational
constants ($A$, $B$, and $C$) and three torsional constants ($F$, $V_3$ and
$\rho$). This model is verified by comparing obtained sensitivities for
methanol, acetaldehyde, acetamide, methyl formate and acetic acid with a full
analysis of the molecular Hamiltonian. From the molecules considered, methanol
appears to be the most suitable candidate for laboratory and cosmological tests
searching for a possible variation of $\mu$.

information that is represented by propositional data. However, this kind of
representation can be quite restrictive and, in many cases, it requires more
complex structures in order to represent data in a more natural way. Terms are
the basis for functional and logic programming representation. Distances
between terms are a useful tool not only to compare terms, but also to
determine the search space in many of these applications. This dissertation
applies distances between terms, exploiting the features of each distance and
the possibility to compare from propositional data types to hierarchical
representations. The distances between terms are applied through the k-NN
(k-nearest neighbor) classification algorithm using XML as a common language
representation. To be able to represent these data in an XML structure and to
take advantage of the benefits of distance between terms, it is necessary to
apply some transformations. These transformations allow the conversion of flat
data into hierarchical data represented in XML, using some techniques based on
intuitive associations between the names and values of variables and
associations based on attribute similarity.
  Several experiments with the distances between terms of Nienhuys-Cheng and
Estruch et al. were performed. In the case of originally propositional data,
these distances are compared to the Euclidean distance. In all cases, the
experiments were performed with the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor
algorithm, using several exponents for the attraction function (weighted
distance). It can be seen that in some cases, the term distances can
significantly improve the results on approaches applied to flat
representations.

induces a connected subgraph of Z^d for all levels u, the vacant set has a
non-trivial phase transition in u, as shown in arXiv:0704.2560 and

  For a positive epsilon, we allow each vertex of the random interlacement

to become occupied with probability epsilon, independently of the randomness of
the interlacement, and independently for different vertices. We prove that for
any d>=3 and u>0, almost surely, the perturbed random interlacement percolates
for small enough noise parameter epsilon. In fact, we prove the stronger
statement that Bernoulli percolation on the random interlacement graph has a
non-trivial phase transition in wide enough slabs. As a byproduct, we show that
any electric network with i.i.d. positive resistances on the interlacement
graph is transient, which strengthens our result in arXiv:1102.4758. As for the

scales and the clear evidence for non-power law Galactic emission near 8 GHz, a
new analysis of Conklin's data is informative. In this paper we compare
Conklin's data to that from Haslam et al. (0.4 GHz), Reich and Reich (1.4 GHz),
and WMAP (23-94 GHz). We show that the spectral index between Conklin's data
and the 23 GHz WMAP data is beta=-1.7+-0.1, where we model the emission
temperature as T \propto nu^beta. Free-free emission has beta \approx -2.15,
synchrotron emission has beta \approx -2.7 to -3. Thermal dust emission (beta
\approx1.7) is negligible at 8 GHz. We conclude that there must be another
distinct non-power law component of diffuse foreground emission that emits near
10 GHz, consistent with other observations in this frequency range. By
comparing to the full complement of data sets, we show that a model with an
anomalous emission component, assumed to be spinning dust, is preferred over a
model without spinning dust at 5 sigma (Delta chi2= 31). However, the source of

lifts the electron-spin degeneracy as a consequence of spin-orbit interaction

physical properties, including a wide range of densities and core sizes for a
given planetary mass. Motivated by the observational sample, this paper studies
the accretion of rocky planets by Hot Jupiters, after the Jovian planets have
finished their principal migration epoch and become parked in $\sim4$-day
orbits. In this scenario, rocky planets form later and then migrate inward due
to torques from the remaining circumstellar disk, which also damps the orbital
eccentricity. This mechanism thus represents one possible channel for
increasing the core masses and metallicities of Hot Jupiters. This paper
determines probabilities for the possible end states for the rocky planet:
collisions with the Jovian planets, accretion onto the star, ejection from the
system, and long-term survival of both planets. These probabilities depend on
the mass of the Jovian planet and its starting orbital eccentricity, as well as
the eccentricity damping rate for the rocky planet. Since these systems are
highly chaotic, a large ensemble ($N\sim10^3$) of simulations with effectively
equivalent starting conditions is required. Planetary collisions are common
when the eccentricity damping rate is sufficiently low, but are rare otherwise.
For systems that experience planetary collisions, this work determines the
distributions of impact velocities -- both speeds and impact parameters -- for
the collisions. These velocity distributions help determine the consequences of
the impacts, e.g., where energy and heavy elements are deposited within the
giant planets.

Fourier-limited X-ray pulses. In this way, no monochromator is needed in the
experimental hall. Self-seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrow
the SASE bandwidth to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. These are
important for many experiments including 3D diffraction imaging. We discuss the
implementation of a single-crystal self-seeding scheme in the hard X-ray lines
of the European XFEL. For this facility, transform-limited pulses are
particularly valuable since they naturally support the extraction of more FEL
power than at saturation by exploiting tapering in the tunable-gap baseline
undulators. Tapering consists of a stepwise change of the undulator gap from
segment to segment. Based on start-to-end simulations dealing with the
up-to-date parameters of the European XFEL, we show that the FEL power reaches
about 400 GW, or one order of magnitude higher power than the SASE saturation
level (20 GW). This analysis indicates that our self-seeding scheme is not
significantly affected by non-ideal electron phase-space distribution, and
yields about the same performance as in the case for an electron beam with
ideal parameters. The self-seeding scheme with a single crystal monochromator
is extremely compact (about 5 m long), and cost estimations are low enough to
consider adding it to the European XFEL capabilities from the very beginning of
the operation phase.

space-variant filtering using Gaussian-like kernels. The algorithm was based on
the observation that both isotropic and anisotropic Gaussians could be
approximated using certain bivariate splines called box splines. The attractive
feature of the algorithm was that it allowed one to continuously control the
shape and size (covariance) of the filter, and that it had a fixed
computational cost per pixel, irrespective of the size of the filter. The
algorithm, however, offered a limited control on the covariance and accuracy of
the Gaussian approximation. In this work, we propose some improvements by

pulses. Also, monitoring observations of magnetar 4U0142+61 following its 2006
X-ray bursts were obtained. No radio emission was detected was detected for any
of our targets. The non-detections allow us to place luminosity upper limits
(at 1950 MHz) of approximately L < 1.60 mJy kpc^2 for periodic emission and L <
7.6 Jy kpc^2 for single pulse emission. These are the most stringent limits yet
for the magnetars observed. The resulting luminosity upper limits together with
previous results are discussed, as is the importance of further radio
observations of radio-loud and radio-quiet magnetars.

theory, Tsallis statistics and Beck-Cohen superstatistics in statistical
mechanics and the general pathway model are all shown to be connected to the

generalized special functions such as Meijer's G-function and Fox's H-function

reaction rates leads to an extended reaction rate probability integral. The
closed form representation for these thermonuclear functions are used to obtain
the stellar luminosity and neutrino emission rates. The composite parameter {C}
that determines the standard nuclear reaction rate through the
Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution is extended to {C}^* by the extended
reaction rates through a more general distribution than the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution. The new distribution is obtained by the pathway model introduced
by Mathai in 2005 [Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 396, 317-328]. Simple
analytic models considered by various authors are utilized for evaluating
stellar luminosity and neutrino emission rates and are obtained in generalized
special functions such as Meijer's G-function and Fox's H-function. The
standard and extended non-resonant thermonuclear functions are compared by
plotting them. Behavior of the new energy distribution, more general than
Maxwell-Boltzmann is also studied.

They are
fundamental assumptions for the mode of existence of those individuals which
are said to be in space and time. In the present paper the ontology of space in
the General Formal Ontology (GFO) is expounded. This ontology is represented as
a theory BT (Brentano Theory), which is specified by a set of axioms formalized
in first-order logic. This theory uses four primitive relations: SReg(x) (x is
space region), spart(x, y) (x is spatial part of y), sb(x, y) (x is spatial
boundary of y), and scoinc(x, y) (x and y spatially coincide). This ontology is
inspired by ideas of Franz Brentano. The investigation and exploration of Franz
Brentano's ideas on space and time began about twenty years ago by work of R.M.
Chisholm, B. Smith and A. Varzi. The present paper takes up this line of
research and makes a further step in establishing an ontology of space which is
based on rigorous logical methods and on principles of the new philosophical
approach of integrative realism.
