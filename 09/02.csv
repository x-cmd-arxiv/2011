slabs with an additional clumpy dust distribution affecting stellar populations
younger than 25 Myr. The model for the Lyman alpha escape fraction is based on
the results of our Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code (CLARA) for a slab

intergalactic medium to a constant value of 50% at all redshifts. From the
results of this model we calculate xLya, the fraction of Lyman Break Galaxies
with Lyman alpha equivalent width (EW) larger than 50 Angstrom. We find a
remarkable agreement with observational data at 4.5 < z < 6. For bright (-22 <
MUV < -20.5) and faint (-20.5 < MUV < -18.5) galaxies our model predicts xLya =

to variations of the notions of commutant lifting and Ando's theorem. This is
applied to the study of semicrossed products by automorphisms, and
endomorphisms which lift to the C*-envelope. In particular, we obtain several

data size, the method requires an automatic classification algorithm. We use
k-means. Our systematic search renders 32 galaxies having negligible [NII]
lines, as expected in XMP galaxy spectra. Twenty one of them have been
previously identified as XMP galaxies in the literature -- the remaining eleven
are new. This was established after a thorough bibliographic search that
yielded only some 130 galaxies known to have an oxygen metallicity ten times
smaller than the Sun (explicitly, with 12+log(O/H) <= 7.65). XMP galaxies are
rare; they represent 0.01% of the galaxies with emission lines in SDSS/DR7.
Although the final metallicity estimate of all candidates remains pending,
strong-line empirical calibrations indicate a metallicity about one-tenth
solar, with the oxygen metallicity of the twenty one known targets being
12+log(O/H)= 7.61 +- 0.19. Since the SDSS catalog is limited in apparent
magnitude, we have been able to estimate the volume number density of XMP
galaxies in the local universe, which turns out to be (1.32 +- 0.23) x 10^-4
Mpc^-3. The XMP galaxies constitute 0.1% of the galaxies in the local volume,
or some 0.2% considering only emission line galaxies. All but four of our
candidates are blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs), and 24 of them have either
cometary shape or are formed by chained knots.

evolution of the flux tube changes from convection dominated to magnetic
buoyancy dominated as the initial field strength increases from 15 kG to 100

controlled by the growth of the magnetic buoyancy instability. However, at low
field strengths of 15 kG, the development of rising Omega-shaped loops is
largely controlled by convective flows, and properties of the emerging loops
are significantly changed compared to previous results in the absence of
convection. With convection, rise times are drastically reduced (from years to
a few months), loops are able to emerge at low latitudes, and tilt angles of
emerging loops are consistent with Joy's Law for initial field strengths of
greater than or equal to 40 kG. We also examine other asymmetries that develop
between the leading and following legs of the emerging loops. Taking all the
results together, we find that mid-range field strengths of approximately 40 -
50 kG produce emerging loops that best match the observed properties of solar

Using a locator
expansion we find that in the insulator, unlike for typical fermion problems,
nearly all low-energy scattering paths come with positive amplitudes and hence
interfere constructively. As a consequence, the localization length of bosonic
excitations shrinks when the constructive interference is suppressed by a
magnetic field, entailing an exponentially large positive magnetoresistance,
opposite to and significantly stronger than the analogous effect in fermions.
Within the forward scattering approximation, we find that the lowest energy
excitations are the most delocalized. A similar analysis applied to random
field Ising models suggests that the ordering transition is due to a
delocalization initiated at zero energy rather than due to the closure of a
mobility gap in the paramagnet.

filamentary radio continuum emission in a geometrical distribution that we
interpret as the boundary of the northwestern nuclear outflow cone. The
scaleheight of the continuum emission is 150+/-20 pc, regardless of the
observing frequency. The equipartition magnetic field strength is 46+/-10
microG for the total field and 21+/-5 microG for the regular field in the
filaments. The ordered magnetic field is aligned along the filaments, in
agreement with amplification due to compression. The perpendicular diffusion
coefficient across the filaments is kappa_perp = 1.5 x 10^28 cm^2 s^-1
E(GeV)^(0.5+/-0.7). In the SE part of the nuclear outflow cone the magnetic
field is pointing away from the disc in form of a helix, with an azimuthal
component increasing up to at least 1200 pc height, where it is about equal to
the total component. The ordered magnetic field in the disc is anisotropic
within a radius of 2.2 kpc. At larger radii, the large-scale field is regular
and of even parity. The magnetic field is able to collimate the outflow, which
can explain the observed small opening angle of ~26 degree. Due to angular
momentum conservation, the field lines are frozen into the plasma and are wound
up into a helix. Strong adiabatic losses of the cosmic-ray electrons can partly
explain why the radio luminosity of the nucleus lies below the radio-FIR
correlation.

plasmas also containing the neutrals, dust grains, and other species. We assume
that background temperatures of electrons and ions are different and include

cooling-heating functions are taken as different ones for electrons and ions.
As a specific case, we consider a condensation mode of thermal instability of
long-wavelength perturbations when the dynamical time is smaller than a time
during which the particles cover the wavelength along the magnetic field due to
thermal velocity. We derive a general dispersion relation taking into account
the effects mentioned above and obtain simple expressions for growth rates in
limiting cases. Perturbations are shown to have an electromagnetic nature. We
find that at conditions under consideration transverse scale sizes of unstable

potential to provide dramatically higher storage efficiency for the same
availability. One main challenge in the design of such codes is the exact
repair problem: if a node storing encoded information fails, in order to
maintain the same level of reliability we need to create encoded information at
a new node. One of the main open problems in this emerging area has been the
design of simple coding schemes that allow exact and low cost repair of failed
nodes and have high data rates. In particular, all prior known explicit
constructions have data rates bounded by 1/2.
  In this paper we introduce the first family of distributed storage codes that
have simple look-up repair and can achieve arbitrarily high rates. Our
constructions are very simple to implement and perform exact repair by simple
XORing of packets. We experimentally evaluate the proposed codes in a realistic

predicted by general relativity by using the value of the Sun's angular
momentum S = 190 x 10^39 kg m^2 s^-1 from helioseismology, is -2.0
milliarcseconds per century, computed in a celestial equatorial reference
frame. It disagrees at 4-{\sigma} level with the correction 0.4 +/- 0.6
milliarcseconds per century to the standard Newtonian/Einsteinian precession,
provided that the latter is to be entirely attributed to frame-dragging. The
supplementary precession was recently determined in a global fit with the
INPOP10a ephemerides to a long planetary data record (1914-2010) including also
3 data points collected in 2008-2009 from the MESSENGER spacecraft. The
INPOP10a models did not include the solar gravitomagnetic field at all, so that
its signature might have partly been removed in the data reduction process. On
the other hand, the Lense-Thirring precession may have been canceled to a
certain extent by the competing precessions caused by small mismodeling in the
quadrupole mass moment of the Sun and in the PPN parameter beta entering the
Schwarzschild-like 1PN precession, both modeled in INPOP10a. On the contrary,
the oblateness of Mercury itself has a negligible impact on its perihelion. The
same holds for the mismodelled actions of both the largest individual asteroids
and the ring of the minor asteroids. Future analysis of more observations from
the currently ongoing MESSENGER mission will shed further light on such an
issue which, if confirmed, might potentially challenge our present-day picture
of the currently accepted laws of gravitation and/or of the physical properties
of the Sun.

Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) above 57 EeV and nearby candidate Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) from the Veron-Cetty Veron catalog (VCV). In this paper we report
on Chandra X-ray observations of 10 unconfirmed VCV AGN-candidates and luminous
IR galaxies correlating with the first set of Auger UHECRs, to determine
whether or not they have active nuclei. The X-ray data, when combined with
optical luminosities, show that in fact none of the 10 galaxies have a
significant AGN component; if there is any nuclear activity at all, it is weak
rather than obscured. This reduces the number of UHECRs in the original Auger
dataset possibly correlating with AGNs from 20 of 27 down to 14 of 27. We also
used Chandra to measure the X-ray luminosity of ESO 139-G12, an AGN which
correlates with 2 of the Auger UHECRs, to obtain the first estimate of its
bolometric luminosity; this completes the determination of the bolometric
luminosities of all correlating AGNs. Taking our results into account, only one
of the 27 UHECRs in the original Auger data-release is correlated on a
few-degree angular scale with an identified AGN that is powerful enough in its
steady-state to accelerate protons to the observed energies, according to
conventional acceleration mechanisms. Intriguingly, approximately 60% of the
UHECRs with $|b|>10^\circ$ do correlate with genuine AGNs, but these are too
weak to meet the acceleration criterion for protons; this may be an indication
that AGNs experience transient high-luminosity states which can accelerate
UHECRs. To determine the source(s) and composition of UHECRs through
statistical correlation studies requires reliable, complete and uniform
catalogs of identified AGNs; our a posteriori inspection of ambiguous source
candidates underscores the inadequacies of the VCV catalog in this respect.

response to seasonal changes of rainfall and rates of evapotranspiration,
rising above the ground during the wet season and sinking below in the dry
period. A quantitative understanding of dune mobility in an environment with
varying groundwater level is essential for coastal management as well as for
the study of long-term evolution of many dune fields. Here we apply a model for
aeolian dunes to study the genesis of coastal dune fields in presence of an
oscillating water table. We find that the morphology of the field depends on
the time cycle, $T_{\mathrm{w}}$, of the water table and the maximum height,
$H_{\mathrm{w}}$, of its oscillation. Our calculations show that long chains of
barchanoids alternating with interdune ponds such as found at Len\c{c}\'ois

process of star formation. Being highly non-linear and stochastic, the outcome
of collapse can only be explored theoretically by performing large ensembles of
numerical simulations. Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent
velocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some
equivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \equiv -d log Pk /d log
k). In this paper, we present a numerical study of the influence of the details
of the turbulent velocity field on the collapse of an isolated, weakly
turbulent, low-mass prestellar core. We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is
usually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in
the turbulent velocity field, {\lambda}_MAX. This is because {\lambda}_MAX
carries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount
and the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core. We show that the
formation of dense filaments during collapse depends critically on
{\lambda}_MAX, and we explain this finding using a force balance analysis. We
also show that the core only has a high probability of fragmenting if
{\lambda}_MAX > 0.5 R_CORE (where R_CORE is the core radius); that the dominant
mode of fragmentation involves the formation and break-up of filaments; and
that, although small protostellar disks (with radius R_DISK <= 20 AU) form
routinely, more extended disks are rare. In turbulent, low-mass cores of the
type we simulate here, the formation of large, fragmenting protostellar disks
is suppressed by early fragmentation in the filaments.

important ices exists for broadband UV lamp experiments. UV fields around
low-mass pre-main sequence stars, around shocks and in many other astrophysical
environments are however often dominated by discrete atomic and molecular
emission lines. It is therefore crucial to consider the wavelength dependence
of photodesorption yields and mechanisms. In this work, for the first time, the
wavelength-dependent photodesorption of pure CO ice is explored between 90 and
170 nm. The experiments are performed under ultra high vacuum conditions using
tunable synchrotron radiation. Ice photodesorption is simultaneously probed by
infrared absorption spectroscopy in reflection mode of the ice and by
quadrupole mass spectrometry of the gas phase. The experimental results for CO
reveal a strong wavelength dependence directly linked to the vibronic
transition strengths of CO ice, implying that photodesorption is induced by
electronic transition (DIET). The observed dependence on the ice absorption
spectra implies relatively low photodesorption yields at 121.6 nm (Ly-alpha),
where CO barely absorbs, compared to the high yields found at wavelengths
coinciding with transitions into the first electronic state of CO (singulet Pi
at 150 nm); the CO photodesorption rates depend strongly on the UV profiles

environment. The mass-size relation reveals that ETGs overall appear to be more
compact in denser environments: cluster ETGs have sizes on average around
30-50% smaller than those of the local universe, and a distribution with a
smaller scatter, whereas field ETGs show a mass-size relation with a similar
distribution than the local one. Our results imply that (1) the mass-size
relation in the field did not evolve overall from z ~ 1.3 to present; this is
interesting and in contrast to the trend found at higher masses from previous
works; (2) in denser environments, either ETGs have increased their size by
30-50%, on average, and spread their distributions, or more ETGs have been
formed within the dense environment from not ETG progenitors or larger galaxies
have been accreted to a pristine compact population to reproduce the mass-size
relation observed in the local Universe. Our results are driven by galaxies
with masses M<2*10^11Msun and those with masses M~10^11Msun follow the same

haloes should be characterized by a concentration-mass relation that decreases
monotonically with halo mass, and populated by a large amount of substructures,

create realistic cluster-scale lenses with properties independent of numerical

the density profile of a halo, followed in order of importance by halo
triaxiality and the presence of a bright central galaxy.

that the same process or combination of processes for fueling supermassive

Lorentz force. The quasi-linear approximation is most broadly justifiable by
its correspondence with computational solutions of nonlinear
magneto-hydrodynamics, and it is rigorously derived in the limit of large
resistivity, $\eta \rightarrow \infty$. Dynamo action occurs even without mean
helicity in the forcing or flow, but random helicity variance is then
essential. In a sufficiently large domain and with small wavenumber $k_z$ in
the direction perpendicular to the mean shearing plane, a positive exponential
growth rate $\gamma$ can occur for arbitrary values of $\eta$, the viscosity
$\nu$, and the random-forcing correlation time $t_f$ and phase angle $\theta_f$

The shear dynamo is ""fast"", with finite $\gamma > 0$ in the limit of $\eta

field grows more slowly, if at all, compared to the r.m.s. field (or magnetic
energy). In the limit of small Reynolds numbers ($\eta, \ \nu \rightarrow

is not affected by the long-range memory in the asymptotic limit and remains a

simulations that include a detailed treatment of star formation, feedback,
metal enrichment and supernova dust production; these same simulations have
already been shown to successfully reproduce a large number of observed
properties of LAEs (Dayal et al. 2010). We identify LBGs as galaxies with an
absolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitude M_{UV} <= -17, consistent with current
observational criteria. With no further parameter tuning, the model reproduces
the redshift evolution of the LBG UV luminosity function, stellar mass
function, and star formation rate (SFR) density extremely well, compared to the
data at z~6-8. It predicts a z-independent average beta value of about -2.2,
consistent with the most recent observational results. The mean LBG specific
SFR increases from 6.7 Gyr^-1 at z ~ 6 to 13.9 Gyr^-1 at z ~ 8, and is largest

stellar masses, ages, SFR, and dust content; only the faintest LBGs with M_{UV}
>= -18 (-19) at z ~ 6 (8) do not show an observable Lyman Alpha line. LAEs
hence represent a luminous LBG subset, whose relative extent depends only on
the adopted equivalent width (EW) selection criteria. Further, in line with
current observations, we find that the fraction of LBGs showing a Lyman Alpha

reionization. We conclude with a brief critical model discussion, which

irradiation, lead to the surface colors that are seen today. The objects formed
in the inner part of the primordial belt retain only H2O and CO2 as the major
ice species on their surfaces. Irradiation of these species plausibly results
in the dark neutrally colored centaurs and KBOs. Object formed further in the
disk retain CH3OH, which has been shown to lead to brighter redder surfaces
after irradiation, as seen in the brighter redder centaurs and KBOs. Objects
formed at the current location of the cold classical Kuiper belt uniquely

correlation functions from the JIMWLK evolution, in the limit where the number
of colors is large. Namely, we show that by exploiting the structure of the
'virtual' terms in the Balitsky-JIMWLK equations, one can derive functional
relations expressing arbitrary n-point functions of the Wilson lines in terms
of the 2-point function (the scattering amplitude for a color dipole). These
approximations are correct not only in the regime of strong scattering, where
the evolution is indeed controlled by the 'virtual' terms, but also in the
regime of weak scattering, where they reduce to the corresponding BFKL
solutions. This last feature follows from the fact that the JIMWLK Hamiltonian
is a linear combination of the pieces responsible for the 'real' and 'virtual'
terms, respectively. We apply this scheme to two examples: the 'color
quadrupole' (the 4-point function of the Wilson lines which enters the
cross-section for the production of a pair of jets at forward rapidities) and
the 'color sextupole' (the 6-point function). For particular configurations of
the quadrupole, our general formula reduces to relatively simple expressions
that have been previously proposed on the basis of the McLerran-Venugopalan
model and which were recently shown to agree quite well with exact, numerical,
solutions to the JIMWLK equation.

clearly younger with an age of 1.5^{+1.5}_{-0.5}Myr, and is dominated by three
very luminous H-rich Wolf-Rayet stars which may have masses \geq100\msun. The
two clusters have mass functions consistent with the Salpeter slope, and total
cluster masses of 8000\pm1500\msun\ and 3000\pm800\msun\ for Danks 1 and Danks
2 respectively. Danks 1 is significantly the more compact cluster of the two,
and is one of the densest clusters in the Galaxy with $\log (\rho/M_{\odot}{\rm

population of apparently isolated Wolf-Rayet stars within the molecular cloud's
cavity. Our results suggest that the star-forming history of G305 began with
the formation of Danks 2, and subsequently Danks 1, with the origin of the
diffuse evolved population currently uncertain. Together, the massive stars at

times. Because of this non-adiabatic process, the beam perpendicular energy of
initially cold beam grows until all filaments coalesce into one pinched beam
with the beam radius much smaller than initial radius and smaller than the
electron skin depth. It was shown through particle-in-cell simulations that a
significant fraction of the beam is not pinched by the magnetic forces of the
pinched beam and fills most of the plasma region. The resulting electron beam
energy distribution in the perpendicular direction is close to a Maxwellian for
the bulk electrons. However, there are significant departures from a Maxwellian
for low and high perpendicular energy (deeply trapped and untrapped electrons).
An analytical model is developed describing the density profile of the
resulting pinched beam and large low-density halo around it. Based on this
analytical model, a calculation of the energy transfer from the beam
longitudinal kinetic energy to the transverse beam kinetic energy, the
self-magnetic field, and the plasma electrons is performed. Results of
analytical theory agree well with the particle-in-cell simulations results.

1.4 GHz luminosity of 2.4\pm0.4 x 1.0E+23 W/Hz. This is 1.5-2 times lower than
the upper limits for radio quiescent clusters from the GMRT Radio Halo Survey

bi-modality; (ii) clusters with low X-ray concentrations have a mean radio

not due to contributions from a much smaller subset of ""on-state"" GRHs

developed field of compressed sensing, it shows how a low-dimensional proxy for
the Green's function can be constructed by backpropagating a small set of
random receiver vectors. Then, the source can be located by performing a number
of ""short"" correlations between this proxy and the projection of the recorded
acoustic data in the compressed space. Numerical experiments in a Pekeris ocean
waveguide are presented which demonstrate that this compressed version of MFP
is as effective as traditional MFP even when the compression is significant.
The results are particularly promising in the broadband regime where using as
few as two random backpropagations per frequency performs almost as well as the
traditional broadband MFP, but with the added benefit of generic applicability.
That is, the computationally intensive backpropagations may be computed offline
independently from the received signals, and may be reused to locate any source

isotropy, applying three statistical tests. We found that anisotropy increases
with the number of member galaxies, which means there exists the relation
between anisotropy and cluster richness. We do not find connection of galaxy
alignment and Bautz - Morgan morphological type of parent cluster. The
statistically marginal relation between velocity dispersion and cluster
richness was observed. However it was found that velocity dispersion decreases
with Bautz - Morgan type at almost $3 \sigma$ level. Separately we analyzed
ellipticities for 6188 low redshift ($z < 0.18$) poor and rich galaxy
structures which have been examined along with their evolution. Finally we
analysed the Binggeli effect. The orientation of galaxy groups in the Local
Supercluster (LSC), is strongly correlated with the distribution of
neighbouring groups in the scale till about 20 Mpc. During analyses of galaxy
structures from PF catalogue the situation was quite different. The efect is
observed only for more elongated structures ($e \le 0.3$). The range of the
distance in which the effect was observed, was estimated as about $60 h^{-1}
MPc$.

Other stars are known to have magnetic cycles similar to that of the
Sun. The relationship between these activity variations and the observed
radial-velocity is still not satisfactorily understood. In this first paper our
aim is to assess the long-term activity variations in the low end of the main
sequence, having in mind a planetary search perspective. Methods. We used a
sample of 30 M0-M5.5 stars from the HARPS M-dwarf planet search program with a
median timespan of observations of 5.2 years. We computed chromospheric
activity indicators based on the Ca II H and K, H{\alpha}, He I D3, and Na I D1
and D2 lines. All data were binned in to average out undesired effects such as
rotationally modulated atmospheric inhomogeneities. We searched for long-term
variability of each index and determined the correlations between them.
Results. While the S_CaII, H{\alpha}, and Na I indices showed significant
variability for a fraction of our stellar sample (39%, 33%, and 37%,
respectively), only 10% of our stars presented significant variability in the
He i index. We therefore conclude that this index is a poor activity indicator
at least for this type of stars. Although the H{\alpha} shows good correlation
with S_Ca II for the most active stars, the correlation is lost when the
activity level decreases. This result appears to indicate that the Ca
II-H{\alpha} correlation is dependent on the activity level of the star. The Na
I lines correlate very well with the S_Ca II index for the stars with low
activity levels we used, and are thus a good chromospheric activity proxy for
early-M dwarfs. We therefore strongly recommend the use of the Na I activity
index because the signal-to-noise ratio in the sodium lines spectral region is
always higher than for the calcium lines.

continued along any path in the complex plane deprived of a finite set of
points, f \in\mathcal{A}(\bar{\C} \setminus A), \sharp A <\infty. J. Nuttall
has put forward the important relation between the maximal domain of f where
the function has a single-valued branch and the domain of convergence of the
diagonal Pade approximants for f. The Pade approximants, which are rational
functions and thus single-valued, approximate a holomorphic branch of f in the
domain of their convergence. At the same time most of their poles tend to the
boundary of the domain of convergence and the support of their limiting
distribution models the system of cuts that makes the function f single-valued.
Nuttall has conjectured (and proved for many important special cases) that this
system of cuts has minimal logarithmic capacity among all other systems
converting the function f to a single-valued branch. Thus the domain of
convergence corresponds to the maximal (in the sense of minimal boundary)
domain of single-valued holomorphy for the analytic function f
\in\mathcal{A}(\bar{\C} \setminus A). The complete proof of Nuttall's
conjecture (even in a more general setting where the set A has logarithmic
capacity zero) was obtained by H. Stahl. In this work, we derive strong
asymptotics for the denominators of the diagonal Pade approximants for this
problem in a rather general setting. We assume that A is a finite set of branch
points of f which have the algebraic character and which are placed in a
generic position. The last restriction means that we exclude from our
consideration some degenerated ""constellations"" of the branch points.

to characterize the topography and material properties of a large variety of

specimen causes cantilever deflections that are measured by an optical sensing
mechanism and subsequently utilized to construct the sample topography. Recent
years have seen increased interest in using the AFM to characterize soft
specimens like gels and live cells. This remains challenging due to the complex
and competing nature of tip-sample interaction forces - large tip-sample
interaction force is necessary to achieve good signal-to-noise ratios; However,
large force tends to deform and destroy soft samples. In situ estimation of the
local tip-sample interaction force is needed to control the AFM cantilever
motion and prevent destruction of soft samples while maintaining a good
signal-to-noise ratio. This necessitates the ability to rapidly estimate the
tip-sample forces from the cantilever deflection during operation. This paper
proposes a first approach to a near real-time framework for tip-sample force
inversion. We pose the inverse problem of extracting the tip-sample force as an
unconstrained optimization problem. A fast, parallel forward solver is
developed by utilizing graphical processing units (GPU). This forward solver
shows an effective 30000 fold speed-up over a comparable CPU implementation,
resulting in milli-second calculation times. The forward solver is coupled with
a GPU based particle-swarm optimization implementation. We illustrate the

the dependence of the aspect ratio delta (namely, the lateral size N_{y} over

power-law decay as a function of delta. Its exponent gamma corresponds to a
sensitivity of the threshold depending on delta, and is inversely proportional
to N_{x} (i.e., delta at fixed N_{y}). Further, the power-law exponent zeta,
characterizing the nonlinearity of the I-V property in the intermediate region,
logarithmically increases as delta increases. Our simulations describe the
experimental result zeta=2.25 obtained by Parthasarathy et al. [Phys. Rev.

one-dimensional arrays obtained by Bascones et al. [Phys. Rev. B. 77 (2008)

to the Ohm's law at the large voltage limit, and the combined
tunneling-resistance is inversely proportional to delta. The extended
asymptotic equation with the first-order perturbation well describes the

fluctuations of observables cease and quantum fluctuations dominate.
Competition between different energies, such as kinetic energy, interactions or
thermodynamic potentials, can induce a quantum phase transition between
distinct ground states. Near a continuous quantum phase transition, the
many-body system is quantum critical, exhibiting scale invariant and universal
collective behavior \cite{Coleman05Nat, Sachdev99QPT}. Quantum criticality has
been actively pursued in the study of a broad range of novel materials
\cite{vdMarel03Nat, Lohneysen07rmp, G08NatPhys, Sachdev08NatPhys}, and can
invoke new insights beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm of critical
phenomena \cite{Senthil04prb}. It remains a challenging task, however, to
directly and quantitatively verify predictions of quantum criticality in a
clean and controlled system. Here we report the observation of quantum critical
behavior in a two-dimensional Bose gas in optical lattices near the
vacuum-to-superfluid quantum phase transition. Based on \textit{in situ}
density measurements, we observe universal scaling of the equation of state at
sufficiently low temperatures, locate the quantum critical point, and determine
the critical exponents. The universal scaling laws also allow determination of
thermodynamic observables. In particular, we observe a finite entropy per
particle in the critical regime, which only weakly depends on the atomic
interaction. Our experiment provides a prototypical method to study quantum
criticality with ultracold atoms, and prepares the essential tools for further
study on quantum critical dynamics.

  We show that surfaces with constant COT exist and we classify all graphs in

used in that proof was later generalised by Smirnov so as to apply to a general
O(n) loop model with $n\in [-2,2]$ (the case $n=0$ corresponding to SAWs).
  We modify this model by restricting to a half-plane and introducing a surface
fugacity $y$ associated with boundary sites (also called surface sites), and
obtain a generalisation of Smirnov's identity. The critical value of the
surface fugacity was conjectured by Batchelor and Yung in 1995 to be $y_{\rm

identity, just as the value of growth constant did in Smirnov's identity.

photons. During the RHIC running in the year 2006, STAR with the Forward Pion
Detector++ (FPD++) in place collected 6.8 inverse picobarn of data with an
average polarization of 60%. FPD++ had sufficient acceptance for ""jetlike""
objects, which are clustered responses of an electromagnetic calorimeter
primarily sensitive to incident photons, electrons and positrons. For the
""jet-like"" objects, we reconstructed the angle of the outgoing leading neutral
pion with respect to the fragmenting parton, thus enabling us to disentangle
the contributions to the forward $\pi^0$ asymmetries. The simulated data set
shows that on average there are approximately 2.5 fragmenting mesons per one
""jet-like"" object. Preliminary FPD++ results provide no evidence of measured
contributions to the asymmetry from jet fragmentation, implying the Sivers
distribution functions play a substantial role in producing the large inclusive
$\pi^0$ asymmetries previously measured by STAR.

  Low-Rank Representation","Manuscript accepted by NIPS 2011",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-rank representation (LRR) is an effective method for subspace clustering
and has found wide applications in computer vision and machine learning. The
existing LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It
suffers from $O(n^3)$ computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix
multiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover,
introducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy
computation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we
generalize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the
penalty to change adaptively. We also propose a novel rule to update the
penalty such that the convergence is fast. With our linearized ADM with
adaptive penalty (LADMAP) method, it is unnecessary to introduce auxiliary
variables and invert matrices. The matrix-matrix multiplications are further
alleviated by using the skinny SVD representation technique. As a result, we
arrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity $O(rn^2)$, where $r$ is the rank
of the representation matrix. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our
LADMAP method is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Although we only
present the results on LRR, LADMAP actually can be applied to solving more
general convex programs.

(TL($n$)) model on a vertically infinite lattice with two non-trivial
boundaries. When $n=1$ the ground state eigenvector of the transfer matrix of
this model can be interpreted as a probability distribution of the possible
states of the system. Because of special properties the transfer matrix has at
$n=1$, we can show that the eigenvector is a solution of the q-deformed
Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation, and we use this fact to explicitly calculate
some of the components of the eigenvector. In addition, recursive properties of
the transfer matrix allow us to compute the normalisation of the eigenvector,
and show that it is the product of four Weyl characters of the symplectic
group. The boundary condition of this model lends itself to calculations
relating to horizontal percolation. One of these calculations is a type of
correlation function that can be interpreted as the density of percolation
cluster crossings between the two boundaries of the lattice. It is an example
of a class of parafermionic observables recently introduced in an attempt to
rigorously prove conformal invariance of the scaling limit of critical
two-dimensional lattice models. We derive an exact expression for this
correlation function, and find that it can be expressed in terms of the same
symplectic characters as the normalisation. In order to better understand these
solutions, we use Sklyanin's scheme to perform separation of variables on the
symplectic character, transforming the multivariate character into a product of
single variable polynomials. Analysing the asymptotics of these polynomials
will lead, via the inverse transformation, to the asymptotic limit of the
symplectic character, and thus to the asymptotic limit of the ground state
normalisation and correlation function of the loop model.

on a prescriptive approach, there are programs with standard answer sets, but
without preferred answer sets. According to the standard prescriptive approach
no rule can be fired before a more preferred rule, unless the more preferred
rule is blocked. This is a rather imperative approach, in its spirit.
  In our approach, rules can be blocked by more preferred rules, but the rules
which are not blocked are handled in a more declarative style, their execution
does not depend on the given preference relation on the rules. An argumentation
framework (different from the Dung's framework) is proposed in this paper.
Argu- mentation structures are derived from the rules of a given program. An
attack relation on argumentation structures is defined, which is derived from
attacks of more preferred rules against the less preferred rules. Preferred
answer sets correspond to complete argumentation structures, which are not

characterize the static properties of quantum magnets, the dynamical
information locked in NMR 1/T1 relaxation rates remains notoriously difficult
to interpret. The difficulty arises from the fact that information about all
possible low-energy spin excitations of the electrons, and their coupling to
the nuclear moments, is folded into a single number, 1/T1. Here we develop a
quantitative theory of the NMR 1/T1 relaxation rate in a collinear
antiferromagnet, focusing on the specific example of BaFe2As2. One of the most
striking features of magnetism in BaFe2As2 is a strong dependence of 1/T1 on
the orientation of the applied magnetic field. By careful analysis of the
coupling between the nuclear and electronic moments, we show how this
anisotropy arises from the ""filtering"" of spin fluctuations by the form-factor
for transferred hyperfine interactions. This allows us to make convincing,
quantitative, fits to experimental 1/T1 data for BaFe2As2, for different field
orientations. We go on to show how a quantitative, angle-dependent theory for
the relaxation rate leads to new ways of measuring the dynamical parameters of
magnetic systems, in particular the spin wave velocities.

additional prior knowledge about the unknown object has to be integrated into

that the dimension of the problem can be significantly reduced in the curvelet

range. We confirm that the stellar mass fraction decreases as the total mass
increases and shows (20+/-4)% scatter; in addition, we show that it decreases
as the central entropy increases. The latter behavior supports a twofold
interpretation where heating from merging quenches the star-formation activity
of galaxies in massive systems, and feedback from supernovae and/or radio
galaxies drives a significant amount of gas to the regions beyond r_{500} or,
alternatively, a substantially large amount of intracluster light (ICL) is
associated with galaxies in nonrelaxed systems. Furthermore, less massive
clusters are confirmed to host less gas per unit total mass; however, they
exhibit higher mass fractions in metals, so that their ICM is more metal-rich.
This again supports the interpretation that in the potential wells of low-mass
systems the star-formation efficiency of galaxies was high or, alternatively,
some gas is missing from the hot phase of the ICM. The former hypothesis is
preferred as the main driver of the mass-dependent metal enrichment since the
total mass-to-optical luminosity ratio increases as the total mass increases.

wealth of information on the thermal and magnetic structure of a variety of
astrophysical plasmas, including that of the solar atmosphere. A correct
decoding of such information from the observed Stokes profiles requires a clear
understanding of the effects that radiatively induced quantum interferences (or
coherences) between pairs of magnetic sublevels produce on these observables,
in the absence and in the presence of magnetic fields of arbitrary strength.
Here we present a detailed theoretical investigation on the role of coherences
between pairs of sublevels pertaining to different fine-structure J-levels,
clarifying when they can be neglected for facilitating the modeling of the
linear polarization produced by scattering processes in spectral lines. To this
end, we apply the quantum theory of spectral line polarization and calculate
the linear polarization patterns of the radiation scattered at 90 degrees by a
slab of stellar atmospheric plasma, taking into account and neglecting the
above-mentioned quantum interferences. Particular attention is given to the
2S-2P, 5S-5P, and 3P-3S multiplets. We point out the observational signatures
of this kind of interferences and analyze their sensitivity to the energy
separation between the interfering levels, to the amount of emissivity in the
background continuum radiation, to lower-level polarization, and to the
presence of a magnetic field. Some interesting applications to the following

a phenomenon opposite to the famous Misner-Wheeler ""charge without charge""

gravity/nonlinear-gauge-field system to a charged lightlike brane as a matter
source. The ""charge-hiding"" effect occurs in a wormhole solution which connects
a non-compact ""universe"", comprising the exterior region of
Schwarzschild-(anti-)de-Sitter (SdS) or purely Schwarzschild black hole beyond
the Schwarzschild horizon, to a Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson-type (LCBR)
""tube-like"" ""universe"" via a wormhole ""throat"" occupied by the brane. In this
solution the whole electric flux produced by the brane is expelled into the
""tube-like"" ""universe"" and the brane is detected as neutral by an observer in
the non-compact ""universe"". Next, we find a truly charge-confining wormhole
solution when we couple the bulk gravity/nonlinear-gauge-field system to two
oppositely charged lightlike branes. The latter system possesses a ""two-throat""
wormhole solution, where the ""left-most"" and the ""right-most"" ""universes"" are
two identical copies of the exterior region of SdS black hole beyond the
Schwarzschild horizon, whereas the ""middle"" ""universe"" is of LCBR ""tube-like""
form with geometry dS_2 x S^2. It comprises the finite-extent intermediate
region of dS_2 between its two horizons. Both ""throats"" are occupied by the two
oppositely charged lightlike branes and the whole electric flux produced by the
latter is confined entirely within the middle ""tube-like"" ""universe"". A crucial
ingredient is the special form of the nonlinear gauge field action, which
contains both the standard Maxwell term as well as a square root of the latter.
This theory was previously shown to produce a QCD-like confining dynamics in
flat space-time.

presence of a soft spectral component that remained constant while the total X-
ray intensity varied by \pm10%. This stable soft component, found in the

conventional metallic state as obtained for optimal and overdoping,
respectively. The investigation is performed for the anomalous
high-frequency-oxygen-bond stretching modes (OBSM) which experimentally are
known to display a strong softening of the frequencies upon doping in the
cuprates. This most likely generic anomalous behaviour of the OBSM has been
shown to be due to a strong nonlocal electron-phonon interaction (EPI) mediated
by charge fluctuations on the ions. The modeling of the competing electronic
states of the cuprates is achieved in terms of consecutive orbital selective
incompressibility-compressibility transitions for the charge response. We
demonstrate that the softening of the OBSM in these states is due to nonlocally
induced dynamic charge inhomogenities in form of charge stripes along the CuO
bonds with different orbital character. Thus, a multi-orbital approach is
essential for the CuO plane. The dynamic charge inhomogeneities may in turn be
considered as precursors of static charge stripe order as recently observed in
La$_{2-x}$Ba$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ in a broad range of doping around x=1/8. The latter
may trigger a reconstruction of the Fermi surface into small pockets with
reduced doping. We argue that the incompressibility of the Cu3d orbital and
simultaneously the compressibility of the O2p orbital in the pseudogap state
seems to be required to nucleate dynamic stripes.

linked to the dynamical behavior of parental gas cloud, which governs when and

evolves to a matter dependent minimum where its energy density does not vanish.
In the early universe until the recent past of the Universe, the energy density
of the supersymmetron is negligible compared to the cold dark matter energy
density. Away from the supersymmetric minimum, the equation of state of the

dissipative part, they are given in terms of a Helicoid intersected by a

located inside the critical radius satisfying certain conditions CALR does take

Quasar pairs (6,000-300,000 light-years separation) exemplify the first stages
of this gravitational interaction. The final stages, through binary MBHs and
final collapse with gravitational wave emission, are consistent with the
sub-light-year separation MBHs inferred from optical spectra and
light-variability of two quasars. The double active nuclei of few nearby
galaxies with disrupted morphology and intense star formation (e.g., NGC 6240
and Mkn 463; ~2,400 and ~12,000 light-years separation respectively)
demonstrate the importance of major mergers of equal mass spirals in this
evolution, leading to an elliptical galaxy, as in the case of the double radio
nucleus (~15 light-years separation) elliptical 0402+379. Minor mergers of
galaxies with a smaller companion should be a more common occurrence, evolving
into spiral galaxies with active MBH pairs, but have hitherto not been seen.

old circum-nuclear stellar population of this galaxy, and the closeness of the

formation and stellar feedback. [...] The standard SK relation between surface
densities of cold (neutral+molecular) gas and star formation rate of simulated
galaxies shows a steepening at low gas surface densities, starting from a knee
whose position depends on disc gas fraction: for more gas-rich discs the
steepening takes place at higher surface densities. Because gas fraction and
metallicity are typically related, this environmental dependence mimics the
predictions of models where the formation of H2 is modulated by metallicity.
The cold gas surface density at which HI and molecular gas surface densities
equate can range from ~10 up to 34 Msun/pc^2. As expected, the SK relation
obtained using molecular gas shows much smaller variations among simulations.
We find that disc pressure is not well represented by the classical external
pressure of a disc in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Instead is well fit by
the expression P_fit = Sigma_cold sigma_cold kappa / 6, where the three
quantities on the right-hand side are cold gas surface density, vertical
velocity dispersion and epicyclic frequency. When the ""dynamical"" SK relation,
i.e. the relation that uses gas surface density divided by orbital time, is
considered, we find that all of our simulations stay on the same relation. We
interpret this as a manifestation of the equilibrium between energy injection
and dissipation in stationary galaxy discs, when energetic feedback is
effective and pressure is represented by the expression given above. These
findings further support the idea that a realistic model of the structure of
galaxy discs should take into account energy injection by SNe. [Abridged]

to this method as the variational Garrote (VG). We show that the combination of
the variational approximation and $L_0$ regularization has the effect of making
the problem effectively of maximal rank even when the number of samples is
small compared to the number of variables. The VG is compared numerically with
the Lasso method, ridge regression and the recently introduced paired mean
field method (PMF) (M. Titsias & M. L\'azaro-Gredilla., NIPS 2012). Numerical
results show that the VG and PMF yield more accurate predictions and more
accurately reconstruct the true model than the other methods. It is shown that
the VG finds correct solutions when the Lasso solution is inconsistent due to
large input correlations. Globally, VG is significantly faster than PMF and
tends to perform better as the problems become denser and in problems with
strongly correlated inputs. The naive implementation of the VG scales cubic
with the number of features. By introducing Lagrange multipliers we obtain a
dual formulation of the problem that scales cubic in the number of samples, but
close to linear in the number of features.

fundamental constants should be restricted to their dimensionless combinations,
the literature on variations of the gravitational constant $G$ is entirely
dimensionful. To illustrate applications of this to cosmology, we explicitly
give a dimensionless version of the parameters of the standard cosmological
model, and describe the physics of Big Bang Neucleosynthesis and recombination
in a dimensionless manner. The issue that appears to have been missed in many
studies is that in cosmology the strength of gravity is bound up in the
cosmological equations, and the epoch at which we live is a crucial part of the
model. We argue that it is useful to consider the hypothetical situation of
communicating with another civilization (with entirely different units),
comparing only dimensionless constants, in order to decide if we live in a
Universe governed by precisely the same physical laws. In this thought
experiment, we would also have to compare epochs, which can be defined by
giving the value of any {\it one} of the evolving cosmological parameters. By
setting things up carefully in this way one can avoid inconsistent results when
considering variable constants, caused by effectively fixing more than one
parameter today. We show examples of this effect by considering microwave
background anisotropies, being careful to maintain dimensionlessness
throughout. We present Fisher matrix calculations to estimate how well the fine
structure constants for electromagnetism and gravity can be determined with
future microwave background experiments. We highlight how one can be misled by
simply adding $G$ to the usual cosmological parameter set.

describing respectively, in simplified terms, a payment system and a credit
market. To this purpose we adopt the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution where the
role of the Hamiltonian is taken by the total money supply (i.e. including
money created from debt) of a set of interacting economic agents. As a result,
we can read the main thermodynamic quantities in terms of monetary ones. In
particular, we define for the credit market model a work term which is related
to the impact of monetary policy on credit creation. Furthermore, with our
formalism we recover and extend some results concerning the temperature of an
economic system, previously presented in the literature by considering only the
monetary base as conserved quantity. Finally, we study the statistical ensemble
for the Pareto distribution.

+\gamma $ calculation can precisely reproduce the observed life time of $\pi^0$
decay. Then, we calculate, for the first time, the T-matrix of the $Z^0
\rightarrow \gamma +\gamma $ process in which the vertex of the $\gamma^\mu
\gamma_5$ is responsible for the decay of the weak vector boson. Even though
the decay rate itself vanishes to zero due to the symmetry nature of two
photons (Landau-Yang theorem), the T-matrix of the process has neither linear
nor logarithmic divergences. Therefore, there is no room for the regularization
of the triangle diagrams with the $\gamma^\mu\gamma^5$ vertex. Further, the
T-matrices of all the triangle diagrams do not have any divergences at all, and
therefore it is rigorously proved that the anomaly equation is spurious and
appears only because of the improper regularization of unphysical amplitudes.

available energy levels, in contact with a classical (Maxwell-Boltzmann) or
quantum (Bose-Einstein) heat bath. The particle can undergo transitions between
the levels via thermal activation or deactivation. The energy levels are
alternately raised at a given rate regardless of occupation by the particle,
maintaining a fixed energy gap equal to epsilon between them. We explicitly
calculate the work, heat and entropy production rates. The efficiency in both
the classical and the quantum case goes to a limit between 100% and 50% that
depends on the relative rates of particle transitions and level elevation. In
the classical problem we explicitly find the large deviation functions for
heat, work, and internal energy.
