Hall regime. When the light scattering is spin dependent, we show that images
formed in the far field can be used to distinguish states of the system. The
spatial dependence of the far-field images is determined by the two-particle

transformation. Quasiholes in the system appear in images of the density formed
by collecting the scattered light with a microscope, where the quasihole
statistics are revealed by the reduction in density at the quasihole position.

bolometric double-beta decay experiment under construction at the Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. Two approaches to the computation of
experimental sensitivity for various background scenarios are presented, and an
extension of the sensitivity formulation to the discovery potential case is
also discussed. Assuming a background rate of 10^-2 cts/(keV kg y), we find
that, after 5 years of live time, CUORE has a 1 sigma sensitivity to the
neutrinoless double-beta decay half-life of T_1/2(1 sigma) = 1.6 \times 10^26 y
and thus a potential to probe the effective Majorana neutrino mass down to
40-100 meV; the sensitivity at 1.64 sigma, which corresponds to 90% C.L., will
be T_1/2(1.64 sigma) = 9.5 \times 10^25 y. This range is compared with the
claim of observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay in 76Ge and the
preferred range of the neutrino mass parameter space from oscillation results.

revisited. Employing the on-shell description of flames with arbitrary gas
expansion, a nonlinear second-order differential equation for the front
position of steady flame is derived. Solutions to this equation, obtained
numerically, reveal two distinct physical regimes of laminar flame propagation
controlled by the strong baroclinic effect. They differ by the front shape and
flame speed, the ratio of the total consumption rates in the two regimes being
1.4 to 1.8, depending on the value of the gas expansion coefficient. Comparison
with the existing experimental data on methane-air flames is made, and
explanation of the main trends in the observed flame behavior is given. It is
shown, in particular, that the faster (slower) regime of combustion is realized
in mixtures close to (far from) the stoichiometric composition, with pronounced
changeover in between.

a nondegenerate discrete Euclidean geometry on R_{Deg-A}, (3) the critical

binary systems via the incoherent combination of many ""short""
coherently-analyzed segments. The main focus of the work is on the construction
of a metric on the parameter space for such signals for use in matched-filter
based searches. The metric is defined using a maximum likelihood detection
statistic applied to a binary orbit phase model including eccentricity. We find
that this metric can be accurately approximated by its diagonal form in the
regime where the segment length is << the orbital period. Hence correlations
between parameters are effectively removed by the combination of many
independent observation. We find that the ability to distinguish signal
parameters is independent of the total semi-coherent observation span (for the
semi-coherent span >> the segment length) for all but the orbital angular
frequency. Increased template density for this parameter scales linearly with
the observation span. We also present two example search schemes. The first
uses a re parameterized phase model upon which we compute the metric on
individual short coherently analyzed segments. The second assumes long >> the
orbital period segment lengths from which we again compute the coherent metric
and find it to be approximately diagonal. In this latter case we also show that
the semi-coherent metric is equal to the coherent metric.

confines quarks by virtue of centre sector transitions. The phase diagram by
confinement is obtained as a function of the temperature and the chemical

existence of centre sector transitions in gauge theories with matter, we study

decay accounts for $\sim 50%$ of the magnetization and 50% of the resistance.
During the more rapid part of the decay, the concavity of the slope of the
decay changes sign and this inflection point can be used to provide a
characteristic time. The characteristic time is strongly and systematically
temperature dependent, ranging from $\sim1$x$10^2 s$ at 400K to $\sim3$x$10^5

optically thick emission lines, as opposed to the normal intensity reductions,
for astrophysical plasmas under certain conditions. In particular, the results
are predicted to be dependent both on the geometry of the emitting plasma and
the orientation of the observer. Hence in principle the detection of intensity
enhancement may provide a way of determining the geometry of an unresolved
astronomical source. To investigate such enhancements we have analyzed a sample
of active late-type stars observed in the far ultraviolet spectral region.
Emission lines of O VI in the FUSE satellite spectra of epsilon Eri, II Peg and
Prox Cen were searched for intensity enhancements due to opacity. We have found
strong evidence for line intensity enhancements due to opacity during active or
flare-like activity for all three stars. The O VI 1032/1038 line intensity
ratios, predicted to have a value of 2.0 in the optically thin case, are found
to be up to ~30% larger during several orbital phases. Our measurements,
combined with radiative transfer models, allow us to constrain both the
geometry of the O VI emitting regions in our stellar sources and the
orientation of the observer. A spherical emitting plasma can be ruled out, as
this would lead to no intensity enhancement. In addition, the theory tells us
that the line-of-sight to the plasma must be close to perpendicular to its
surface, as observations at small angles to the surface lead to either no
intensity enhancement or the usual line intensity decrease over the optically
thin value. For the future, we outline a laboratory experiment, that could be
undertaken with current facilities, which would provide an unequivocal test of
predictions of line intensity enhancement due to opacity, in particular the
dependence on plasma geometry.

search engines tend to satisfy the user's informational need on well-formulated
queries. One of the main remaining challenges is to satisfy the users' needs
when they provide a poorly formulated query. When the pages matching the user's
original keywords are judged to be unsatisfactory, query expansion techniques
are used to alter the result set. These techniques find keywords that are
similar to the keywords given by the user, which are then appended to the
original query leading to a perturbation of the result set. However, when the
original query is sufficiently ill-posed, the user's informational need is best
met using entirely different keywords, and a small perturbation of the original
result set is bound to fail.
  We propose a novel approach that is not based on the keywords of the original
query. We intentionally seek out orthogonal queries, which are related queries
that have low similarity to the user's query. The result sets of orthogonal
queries intersect with the result set of the original query on a small number
of pages. An orthogonal query can access the user's informational need while
consisting of entirely different terms than the original query. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by proposing a query expansion method derived
from these observations that improves upon results obtained using the Yahoo
BOSS infrastructure.

requires understanding the back-reaction of whatever localized objects source

broad class of geometries, directly relates the curvature of the
lower-dimensional geometry to asymptotic properties of various bulk fields near
the sources. Specializing to codimension-two sources, we find that the
contribution involving the asymptotic behaviour of the warp factor (which has a
definite sign for most supergravities and so is usually used to infer a
preference for anti-de Sitter geometries) is precisely canceled by the
contribution of the sources themselves (that are left out in earlier
treatments). We identify which combination of bulk fields survives this
cancelation, and so controls the sign of the lower-dimensional geometry, for
several supergravities in 6, 10 and 11 dimensions. Our results show precisely
why explicit 4D de Sitter solutions to 6D supergravity evade general no-go

photometric signatures common to these AHQs but atypical of other quasars.
These features are similar to some aspects of narrow-line Seyfert 1s and
correlations identified by Eigenvector 1, but also contain distinct features
that make AHQs difficult to classify. We demonstrate that AHQs comprise at

linked fit produces a tight correlation between narrow- and broad-line
velocities. We find that [O III] in AHQs sometimes has a standard narrow-line
profile and other times matches the H\beta core, but is rarely in between the
two, implying that the broadened core emission arises from a distinct physical
region. Another feature of AHQs is a diminished [O II] line, which might
indicate a connection between AHQs and the interstellar mediums of their host

the analogue of the method of images to calculate the back-reaction (or

on the shape and amplitude of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) power
spectrum from the post-reionization epoch. This is achieved by constructing a
new model of the kSZ power spectrum which we calibrate to the results of
hydrodynamic simulations. By construction, our method accounts for all relevant
density and velocity modes and so is unaffected by the limited box size of our
simulations. We find that radiative cooling and star-formation can reduce the
amplitude of the kSZ power spectrum by up to 33%, or 1 uK^2 at ell = 3000. This
is driven by a decrease in the mean gas density in groups and clusters due to
the conversion of gas into stars. Variations in the redshifts at which helium
reionization occurs can effect the amplitude by a similar fraction, while
current constraints on cosmological parameters (namely sigma_8) translate to a
further +-15% uncertainty on the kSZ power spectrum. We demonstrate how the
models presented in this work can be constrained -- reducing the astrophysical
uncertainty on the kSZ signal -- by measuring the redshift dependence of the
signal via kSZ tomography. Finally, we discuss how the results of this work can
help constrain the duration of reionization via measurements of the kinetic SZ
signal sourced by inhomogeneous (or patchy) reionization.

computed by the less demanding but less accurate Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)

liquid-liquid phase transition in hydrogen, a first order transition between a
lower pressure, molecular and insulating phase and a higher pressure, partially
dissociated and conducting phase. We provide new results along the T = 600K

transition pressure and specific volumes at coexistence for the model with RQMC
accuracy between the prediction of our procedure and the values that can be
directly inferred from the observed plateau in the pressure-volume curve along

isochrones for pre-main-sequence stars. An average age of 3.1 Myr is derived
for this population which is intermediate between that of objects embedded in
the cloud core of Rho Ophiuchi and low mass stars in the Upper Scorpius

mass-ratio inspirals (stellar compact objects spiraling into a spinning
supermassive black hole) and to produce the gravitational waveforms that
describe the gravitational-wave emission of these systems. This scheme combines
tools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar,
post-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which
provides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and
current octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since
we are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for
the computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH
perturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of
self-adjusting Kerr geodesics. The orbital evolution is thus equivalent to
solving the geodesic equations with time-dependent orbital elements, as
dictated by the MPM radiation-reaction prescription. To complete the scheme,
both the orbital evolution and wave generation require to map the
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates of the orbits to the harmonic coordinates in which
the different MPM quantities have been derived, a mapping that we provide
explicitly in this paper. This new kludge scheme is thus a combination of
approximations that can be used to model generic inspirals of systems with
extreme mass ratios to systems with more moderate mass ratios, and hence can
provide valuable information for future space-based gravitational-wave
observatories like LISA and even for advanced ground detectors. Finally, due to
the local character in time of our MPM self-force, this scheme can be used to
perform studies of the possible appearance of transient resonances in generic
inspirals.

We demonstrate empirically that any complex-valued object can be recovered from
the knowledge of the magnitude of just a few diffracted patterns by solving a
simple convex optimization problem inspired by the recent literature on matrix
completion. More importantly, we also demonstrate that our noise-aware
algorithms are stable in the sense that the reconstruction degrades gracefully
as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases. Finally, we introduce some theory
showing that one can design very simple structured illumination patterns such
that three diffracted figures uniquely determine the phase of the object we

better here than at any other redshift, with an effective limit H=21.5. With an

gradients with a Multilevel BDDC preconditioner. Because the coarse solve in
the first step has the same structure as the original problem, we can use this
procedure recursively and solve (a hierarchy of) coarse problems only
approximately, utilizing the coarse problems known from the BDDC. The resulting
algorithm thus first performs several upscaling steps, and then solves a
hierarchy of problems that have the same structure but increase in size while
sweeping down the levels, using the same components in the first and in the
third step on each level, and also reusing the components from the higher
levels. Because the coarsening can be quite aggressive, the number of levels
can be kept small and the additional computational cost is significantly
reduced due to the reuse of the components. We also provide the condition
number bound and numerical experiments confirming the theory.

isolated black hole is defined by only three parameters: mass, angular

light-crossing time scale. We find that the ""no hair"" theorem is not formally
applicable for black holes formed from collapse of a rotating neutron star.
Rotating neutron stars can self-produce particles via vacuum breakdown forming
a highly conducting plasma magnetosphere such that magnetic field lines are
effectively ""frozen-in"" the star both before and during collapse. In the limit
of no resistivity, this introduces a topological constraint which prohibits the
magnetic field from sliding off the newly-formed event horizon. As a result,
during collapse of a neutron star into a black hole, the latter conserves the
number of magnetic flux tubes $N_B = e \Phi_\infty /(\pi c \hbar)$, where
$\Phi_\infty \approx 2 \pi^2 B_{NS} R_{NS}^3 /(P_{\rm NS} c)$ is the initial
magnetic flux through the hemispheres of the progenitor and out to infinity. We
test this theoretical result via three-dimensional general relativistic plasma
simulations of rotating black holes that start with a neutron star dipole
magnetic field with no currents initially present outside the event horizon.
The black hole's magnetosphere subsequently relaxes to the split monopole
magnetic field geometry with self-generated currents outside the event horizon.
The dissipation of the resulting equatorial current sheet leads to a slow loss
of the anchored flux tubes, a process that balds the black hole on long
resistive time scales rather than the short light-crossing time scales expected

constraints that the detections of gamma rays from several of these sources
place on the contribution of population-III stars to the extragalactic

Lyman-alpha emission, can interact with gamma rays to produce electron-positron
pairs and create an optical depth to the propagation of gamma-ray emission, and
the detection of emission above 10 GeV can therefore constrain the production
of this background. We consider two initial mass functions for the early stars,
and use derived SEDs for each to put upper limits on the star-formation rate
density of massive early stars from redshifts 6 to 10. Our limits are
complementary to those set on a high near-IR background flux by ground-based
TeV-scale observations, and show that current data can limit star-formation in
the late stages of reionization to less than 0.5 M_solar yr^-1 Mpc^-3. Our

of Kubota's theorem. However, while these latter results are well-known to
those working in integral geometry or the theory of convex bodies, the results
are largely unknown to the physics community---so much so that even the 3-d

mathematical literature are, by and large, couched in terms of concepts that
are may not be familiar to many physicists. Therefore, in this work, we present
a simple geometrical method of calculating the ratio of average projected area
to surface area for convex bodies in arbitrary dimensions. We focus on a
pedagogical, physically intuitive treatment that it is hoped will be useful to
those in the physics community. We do discuss the mathematical background of
the theorem as well, pointing those who may be interested to sources that offer
the proofs that are standard in the fields of integral geometry and the theory
of convex bodies. We also provide discussion of the applications of the
theorem, especially noting that higher-dimensional ratios may be of use for
constructing observational tests of string theory. Finally, we examine the
limiting behavior of the ratio with the goal of offering intuition on its
behavior by pointing out a suggestive connection with a well-known fact in

that is untraceable by adversaries that control a small number of machines. To
provide efficient service to users, these anonymity systems make full use of
forwarding capacity when sending traffic between intermediate relays. In this
paper, we show that doing this leaks information about the set of Tor relays in
a circuit (path). We present attacks that, with high confidence and based
solely on throughput information, can (a) reduce the attacker's uncertainty
about the bottleneck relay of any Tor circuit whose throughput can be observed,
(b) exactly identify the guard relay(s) of a Tor user when circuit throughput
can be observed over multiple connections, and (c) identify whether two
concurrent TCP connections belong to the same Tor user, breaking unlinkability.
Our attacks are stealthy, and cannot be readily detected by a user or by Tor
relays. We validate our attacks using experiments over the live Tor network. We
find that the attacker can substantially reduce the entropy of a bottleneck
relay distribution of a Tor circuit whose throughput can be observed-the
entropy gets reduced by a factor of 2 in the median case. Such information
leaks from a single Tor circuit can be combined over multiple connections to
exactly identify a user's guard relay(s). Finally, we are also able to link two
connections from the same initiator with a crossover error rate of less than
1.5% in under 5 minutes. Our attacks are also more accurate and require fewer

for this kind of RHS a mathematical theorem also leads to time symmetric group
evolution. Scattering theory suggests to distinguish mathematically between
states (defined by a preparation apparatus) and observables (defined by a
registration apparatus (detector)). If one requires that scattering resonances
of width $\Gamma$ and exponentially decaying states of lifetime
$\tau=\frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}$ should be the same physical entities (for which
there is sufficient evidence) one is led to a pair of RHS's of Hardy functions
and connected with it, to a semigroup time evolution $t_{0}\leq t<\infty$, with
the puzzling result that there is a quantum mechanical beginning of time, just
like the big bang time for the universe, when it was a quantum system. The
decay of quasi-stable particles is used to illustrate this quantum mechanical

  The FPTAS is based on the correlation decay technique introduced by
Bandyopadhyay and Gamarnik [SODA 06] and Weitz [STOC 06]. The classic
correlation decay is defined with respect to graph distance. Although this
definition has natural physical meanings, it does not directly support an FPTAS
for systems on arbitrary graphs, because for graphs with unbounded degrees, the
local computation that provides a desirable precision by correlation decay may
take super-polynomial time. We introduce a notion of computationally efficient
correlation decay, in which the correlation decay is measured in a refined
metric instead of graph distance. We use a potential method to analyze the
amortized behavior of this correlation decay and establish a correlation decay
that guarantees an inverse-polynomial precision by polynomial-time local
computation. This gives us an FPTAS for spin systems on arbitrary graphs. This
new notion of correlation decay properly reflects the algorithmic aspect of the
spin systems, and may be used for designing FPTAS for other counting problems.

associated to root systems. The basic hypergeometric function in question was
constructed as explicit series expansion in symmetric Macdonald polynomials by
Cherednik in case the associated twisted affine root system is reduced. Its
construction was extended to the nonreduced case by the author. It is a
meromorphic Weyl group invariant solution of the spectral problem of the
Macdonald q-difference operators. The c-function expansion is its explicit
expansion in terms of the basis of the space of meromorphic solutions of the
spectral problem consisting of q-analogs of the Harish-Chandra series. We
express the expansion coefficients in terms of a q-analog of the Harish-Chandra
c-function, which is explicitly given as product of q-Gamma functions. The
c-function expansion shows that the basic hypergeometric function formally is a
q-analog of the Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function, which in turn
specializes to elementary spherical functions on noncompact Riemannian
symmetric spaces for special values of the parameters.

Business intelligence (BI) applications will play a vital role at this stage by
discovering the knowledge hidden in internal as well as external sources. On
the other hand, Knowledge Management (KM) will enhance the organisations
performance by providing collaborative tools to learn, create and share the
knowledge among the employees. The main intention of the BI is to enhance the
employees' knowledge with information that allows them to make decisions to
achieve its organisational strategies. However only twenty percent of data
exist in structured form, majority of banks knowledge is in unstructured or
minds of its employees. Organizations are needed to integrate KM with Knowledge
which is discovered from data and information. The purpose of this paper is to
discuss the need of business insiders in the process of knowledge discovery and
distribution, to make BI more relevant to business of the bank. We have also
discussed about the BI/KM applications in banking industry and provided a
framework to integrate BI and KM in banking industry.

monotherapy with interferon (IFN) and the other for combination therapy with
IFN and ribavirin. Optimal therapy for both the models is determined using the
steepest gradient method, by defining an objective functional which minimizes
the infected hepatocyte levels, virion population and the side-effects of the
drug(s). The optimal therapy for both the models shows an initial period of
high efficacy, followed by a gradual decline. The period of high efficacy
coincides with a significant decrease in the infected hepatocyte levels as well
as viral load, whereas the efficacy drops after liver regeneration through
restored hepatocyte levels. The period of high efficacy is not altered
significantly when the cost coefficients are varied, as long as the side
effects are relatively small. This suggests a higher dependence of the optimal
therapy on the model parameters in case of drugs with minimal side effects.
  We use the Latin hypercube sampling technique to randomly generate a large
number of patient scenarios (i.e, model parameter sets) and study the dynamics
of each set under the optimal therapy already determined. Results show an
increase in the percentage of responders (as indicated by drop in viral load
below detection levels) in case of combination therapy as compared to
monotherapy. Statistical tests performed to study the correlations between
sample parameters and the time required for the viral load to fall below
detection level, show a strong monotonic correlation with the death rate of
infected hepatocytes, identifying it to be an important factor in deciding
individual drug regimens.

processes from the knots of AGN jets as well as for blazar jets. A continuous
injection plasma model is developed to study the X-ray emission from the knots
of sources 1136-135, 1150+497, 1354+195 and 3C 371. The knot dynamics is then
studied within the framework of internal shock model. In such a scenario, knots
are formed due to the collision of two successive matter blobs emitted
sporadically from the central engine of AGN. Shocks, generated in such
collisions, accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. These electrons
subsequently emit radiation via synchrotron and/or inverse Compton processes in
the radio-to-X-ray energy range. The study of M87 knots involves a two zone
model where the electrons with a power-law distribution are further
accelerated. The synchrotron emission from these energetic electrons is then
used to explain the observed spectrum.
  The limb-brightening feature observed in the radio maps of the BL Lac object
MKN501 is studied considering shear acceleration of electrons at the boundary
of the jet. This interpretation does not require a large viewing angle of the
jet as demanded by the earlier models and is consistent with the constraints
obtained from very high energy studies. In case of MKN421, the dependence of
temporal behaviour of radiation emission on the particle acceleration mechanism
has been studied within the framework of two zone model.

as seen by observations of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in such structures,
the field needed to observe the AB periodicity in small molecular rings is
unrealistically large. The present study aims to identify conditions under
which magnetic field dependence can be observed in electronic conduction
through such molecules. We consider molecular ring structures modeled both
within the tight-binding (H\""uckel) model and as continuous rings. In fact,
much of the observed qualitative behavior can be rationalized in terms of a
much simpler two-state model. Dephasing in these models is affected by two
common tools: the B\""uttiker probe method and coherence damping within a
density matrix formulation. We show that current through a benzene ring can be
controlled by moderate fields provided that (a) conduction must be dominated by
degenerate (in the free molecule) molecular electronic resonances, associated
with multiple pathways as is often the case with ring molecules; (b)
molecular-leads electronic coupling must is weak so as to affect relatively
distinct conduction resonances; (c) molecular binding to the leads must be
asymmetric (e.g., for benzene, connection in the meta or ortho, but not para,
configurations) and, (d) dephasing has to be small. Under these conditions,
considerable sensitivity to an imposed magnetic field normal to the molecular
ring plane is found in benzene and other aromatic molecules. Interestingly, in
symmetric junctions (e.g. para connected benzene) a large sensitivity of the
transmission coefficient to magnetic field is not reflected in the
current-voltage characteristic. Although sensitivity to magnetic field is
suppressed by dephasing, quantitative estimates indicate that magnetic field
control can be observed under realistic condition.

source (P_5 GHz = 4.1 x 10^25 W/Hz) hosted by a disk galaxy. Optical images
have been used to model the host galaxy morphology confirming it to be
dominated by a strong (and warped) disk component that is observed close to
edge-on. At radio wavelengths, PKS1814-637 is about 480 pc in diameter and it
is classified as a compact steep spectrum source; such sources are usually
considered to be radio sources observed in the early stages of their evolution.
However, the optical and mid-IR spectroscopic properties of PKS1814-637 show
more in common with Seyfert galaxies than they do with radio galaxies, with the
detection of H_2, and PAH emission features, along with HI and silicate
absorption features, providing evidence for a rich ISM, likely related to the
disk morphology of the host galaxy. The interaction between the radio plasma
and the rich ISM in this and similar objects may have boosted their radio
emission, allowing them to more easily enter flux limited samples of radio
sources. In this case, PKS1814-637 represents a type of ""imposter"": an
intrinsically low power object that is selected in a radio flux limited sample
because of the unusually efficient conversion of jet power into radio emission.
This would make PKS1814-637 an extreme example of the effects of jet-cloud
interactions in galaxies containing a rich ISM, and perhaps a missing link
between radio galaxies and radio-loud Seyfert galaxies. However, it is probable
that the jet in PKS1814-637 is also intrinsically more powerful than in typical
Seyfert galaxies. The estimated BH mass is indeed higher than the majority of
Seyfert galaxies in the local Universe. We speculate that sources similar to
PKS1814-637 are likely to be more common at high redshifts.
