during its 2009 - 2010 outburst and decay to quiescence. The optical light
curve can be described by an exponential decay followed by a plateau, then a
more rapid fade towards quiescence. The plateau appears to be due to an extra
component of optical emission that brightens and then fades over ~ 40 days. We
show evidence for the origin of this optical 'flare' to be the synchrotron jet
during the decaying hard state, and we identify and isolate both disc and jet
components in the spectral energy distributions. The optical flare has the same
morphology and amplitude as a contemporaneous X-ray rebrightening. This
suggests a common origin, but no firm conclusions can be made favouring or
disfavouring the jet producing the X-ray flare. The quiescent optical
magnitudes are B >= 20.6, V >= 21.1, R >= 19.5, i' >= 19.2. From the optical
outburst amplitude we estimate a likely orbital period of < 22 h. We also
present near-infrared (NIR) photometry and polarimetry and rare mid-infrared
imaging (8 - 12 microns) when the source is nearing quiescence. The fading jet
component, and possibly the companion star may contribute to the NIR flux. We
derive deep mid-IR flux upper limits and NIR linear polarization upper limits.
With the inclusion of radio data, we measure an almost flat jet spectral index
between radio and optical; F_nu ~ nu^(~ +0.05). The data favour the jet break
to optically thin emission to reside in the infrared, but may shift to
frequencies as high as the optical or UV during the peak of the flare.

J162011+1724327 have been reported and discussed. With investigation of the
variations in the quasar inner structure we explore how much this effect can
affect the position determination and whether it can be (or not) detected with
Gaia mission. We used (a) a model of a relativistic disk, including the
perturbation that can increase brightness of a part of the disk, and
consequently offset the photocenter position, and (b) a model of a dusty torus
which absorbs and re-emits the incoming radiation from accretion disk. We
estimated the value of the photocenter offset due to these two effects. We
found that perturbations in the inner structure can significantly offset the
photocenter. It depends on the characteristics of perturbation and accretion
disk and structure of the torus. In the case of two considered QSOs the
observed photocenter offsets cannot be explained by variations in the accretion
disk and other effects should be considered. We discussed possibility of
exploding stars very close to the AGN source, and also possibility that there
are two variable sources in the center of these two AGNs that may indicate a
binary super-massive black hole system on a kpc (pc) scale. The Gaia mission
seems to be very perspective, not only for astrometry, but also for exploring
the inner structure of AGNs. We conclude that variations in the quasar inner
structure can affect the observed photocenter (up to several mas). There is a
chance to observe such effect in the case of bright and low-redshifted QSOs.

varies by a factor of two or more, and finds an increase in Ne/O with
increasing active region plasma temperature. The latter is reminiscent of
evidence for increasing Ne/O with stellar activity in low-activity coronae that
reaches a ""neon saturation"" in moderately active stars at approximately twice
the historically accepted solar value of about 0.15 by number. We argue that
neon saturation represents the underlying stellar photospheric compositions,
and that low activity coronae, including that of the Sun, are generally
depleted in neon. The implication would be that the solar Ne/O abundance ratio
should be revised upward by a factor of about two to n(Ne)/n(O)~0.3. Diverse
observations of neon in the local cosmos provide some support for such a
revision. Neon would still be of some relevance for reconciling helioseismology

survey data for the north-central region of the state of Goias (Brazil). The
results obtained indicate that most of the subtropical soil types are
characterized by Uranium contents of greater than one parts per million (ppm).
Only ultisol and oxisol soils are found to have Uranium contents lower than one
ppm. Thorium and Potassium abundances also display trends similar to those of
Uranium. The K/U ratios fall in the expected range of values for common soils
while the Th/U ratios are higher than normal. This latter observation may
indicate a characteristic feature of subtropical soils. Alternatively it may be
considered as indicative of disequilibrium conditions in radioactive series and
consequent underestimation of Uranium in soil layers of the study area. In this
context we point out the possibility of using results of radiometric surveys as
a convenient complementary tool in identifying geochemical zoning of soils in
subtropical environments. Analysis of aeromagnetic data reveals the presence of
a large number of magnetic lineaments. The analytic signal values point to the
existence of substantial small scale variations related to lithologic changes.
There are indications that deposition of soil types are controlled to a large
extent by the system of NE-SW trending faults and fracture systems. According
to results of radiogenic heat production calculations the cambisol soil in this
region are found to have a mean heat production of 3.32 \pm 5.9 \mu Wm-3 while
that of ultisol soil is only 0.36 \pm 0.3 \mu Wm-3. The mean heat production of
soil layers at the surface is 0.68 \pm 0.4 \mu Wm-3. Heat production values of
basement rocks are estimated to be more than 1.3 \muWm-3, after corrections for
density changes and non-equilibrium conditions of Uranium series.

assim- ilation, designed to keep the number of particles manageable by
focussing attention on regions of large probability. These regions are found by
min- imizing, for each particle, a scalar function F of the state variables.
Some previous implementations of the implicit filter rely on finding the
Hessians of these functions. The calculation of the Hessians can be cumbersome
if the state dimension is large or if the underlying physics are such that
derivatives of F are difficult to calculate. This is the case in many
geophysical applica- tions, in particular for models with partial noise, i.e.
with a singular state covariance matrix. Examples of models with partial noise
include stochastic partial differential equations driven by spatially smooth
noise processes and models for which uncertain dynamic equations are
supplemented by con- servation laws with zero uncertainty. We make the implicit
particle filter applicable to such situations by combining gradient descent
minimization with random maps and show that the filter is efficient, accurate
and reliable because it operates in a subspace whose dimension is smaller than
the state dimension. As an example, we assimilate data for a system of
nonlinear partial differential equations that appears in models of
geomagnetism.

typically associated with methods based on parameter fitting. The key idea is
to use the model equations to construct a transformation of the original
variables such that any set of steady states of the model under that
transformation lies on a common plane, irrespective of the values of the model
parameters. Model rejection can then be performed by assessing the degree to
which the transformed data deviate from coplanarity. We demonstrate our method
by applying it to models of multisite phosphorylation and cell death signaling.

dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo model. The model parameters are effective
energy barriers for the nucleation and propagation of graphene at the SiC
steps. When the model is applied to graphene growth on vicinal surfaces, a
strip width distribution is used to characterize the surface morphology.
Additional kinetic processes are included to study graphene growth on SiC
nano-facets. Our main result is that the original nano-facet is fractured into
several nano-facets during graphene growth. This phenomenon is characterized by
the angle at which the fractured nano-facet is oriented with respect to the
basal plane. The distribution of this angle across the surface is found to be
related to the strip width distribution for vicinal surfaces. As the terrace
propagation barrier decreases, the fracture angle distribution changes
continously from two-sided Gaussian to one-sided power-law. Using this
distribution, it will be possible to extract energy barriers from experiments
and interpret the growth morphology quantitatively.

waves are present. Stellar bow shocks, generated by runaway stars, have been
previously detected in small numbers and well-studied. Along with progress in
model development and improvements in observing instruments, our knowledge of
the emission produced by these objects and its origin can now be more clearly
understood. Aims: We produce a stellar bow-shock catalogue by applying uniform
search criteria and a systematic search process. This catalogue is a starting
point for statistical studies, to help us address fundamental questions such
as, for instance, the conditions under wich a stellar bow shock is detectable.
Methods: By using the newest infrared data releases, we carried out a search
for bow shocks produced by early-type runaway stars. We first explored whether
a set of known IRAS bow shock candidates are visible in the most recently
available IR data, which has much higher resolution and sensitivity. We then
carried out a selection of runaway stars from the latest, large runaway
catalogue available. In this first release, we focused on OB stars and searched
for bow-shaped features in the vicinity of these stars. Results: We provide a
bow-shock candidate survey that gathers a total of 28 members which we call the
Extensive stellar BOw Shock Survey (E-BOSS). We derive the main bow-shock
parameters, and present some preliminary statistical results on the detected
objects. Conclusions: Our analysis of the initial sample and the newly detected
objects yields a bow-shock detectability around OB stars of $\sim$ 10 per cent.
The detections do not seem to depend particularly on either stellar mass, age
or position. The extension of the E-BOSS sample, with upcoming IR data, and by
considering, for example, other spectral types as well, will allow us to
perform a more detailed study of the findings.

dependent major-merger rate since z=1. A stellar mass limited sample of close
major-merger pairs (the CPAIR sample) was selected from the archive of the
COSMOS survey. Pair fractions at different redshifts derived using the CPAIR
sample and a local K-band selected pair sample show no significant variations
with stellar mass. The pair fraction exhibits moderately strong cosmic
evolution, with the best-fitting evolutionary index m=2.2+-0.2. The
best-fitting function for the merger rate implies that galaxies with stellar
mass between 1E+10 -- 3E+11 M_sun have undergone 0.5 -- 1.5 major-mergers since
z=1. Our results show that, for massive galaxies at z<1, major mergers
involving star forming galaxies (i.e. wet and mixed mergers) can account for
the formation of both ellipticals and red quiescent galaxies (RQGs). On the
other hand, major mergers cannot be responsible for the formation of most low
mass ellipticals and RQGs. Our quantitative estimates indicate that major
mergers have significant impact on the stellar mass assembly of the most
massive galaxies, but for less massive galaxies the stellar mass assembly is
dominated by the star formation. Comparison with the mass dependent (U)LIRG
rates suggests that the frequency of major-merger events is comparable to or
higher than that of (U)LIRGs.

the Goodwillie tower which sends a spectrum X to the suspension spectrum of its
0th space X_0. This converges strongly to H_*(X_0) when X is 0-connected. The
E^1 term is the homology of the extended powers of X, and thus is a well known
functor of H_*(X), including structure as a bigraded Hopf algebra, a right
module over the mod 2 Steenrod algebra A, and a left module over the
Dyer-Lashof operations.
  Hopf algebra considerations show that all pages of the spectral sequence are
primitively generated, with primitives equal to a subquotient of the primitives
in E^1.
  We use an operad structure on the tower and the Z/2 Tate construction to show
how Dyer-Lashof operations and differentials interact. These then determine
differentials that hold for any spectrum X. These universal differentials then
lead us to construct, for every A-module M, an algebraic spectral sequence
depending functorially on M. The algebraic spectral sequence for H_*(X) agrees
with the topological spectral sequence for X for many spectra, including
suspension spectra and almost all generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spectra, and
appears to give an upper bound in general. The E^infty term of the algebraic
spectral sequence has form and structure similar to E^1, but now the right
A-module structure is unstable. Our explicit formula involves the derived
functors of destabilization as studied in the 1980's by W. Singer, J. Lannes

due to the development of a new quantitative theory based on Radiative
Alignment Torques (RAT). One of the distinguishing predictions of this theory
is a dependence of the grain alignment efficiency on the relative angle
($\Psi$) between the magnetic field and the anisotropy direction of the
radiation field. In an earlier study we found observational evidence for such
an effect from observations of the polarization around the star HD 97300 in the
Chamaeleon I cloud. However, due to the large uncertainties in the measured
visual extinctions, the result was uncertain.
  By acquiring explicit spectral classification of the polarization targets, we
have sought to perform a more precise reanalysis of the existing polarimetry
data.
  We have obtained new spectral types for the stars in our for our polarization
sample, which we combine with photometric data from the literature to derive
accurate visual extinctions for our sample of background field stars. This
allows a high accuracy test of the grain alignment efficiency as a function of
$\Psi$.
  We confirm and improve the measured accuracy of the variability of the grain
alignment efficiency with $\Psi$, seen in the earlier study. We note that the
grain temperature (heating) also shows a dependence on $\Psi$ which we
interpret as a natural effect of the projection of the grain surface to the
illuminating radiation source. This dependence also allows us to derive an
estimate of the fraction of aligned grains in the cloud.

protocluster clumps of different metallicities. In this model, gravitationally
bound cores form uniformly in the clump following a prescribed core formation
efficiency per unit time. After a contraction timescale which is equal to a few
times their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and populate the
IMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account in the form
of stellar winds. When the ratio of the effective energy of the winds to the
gravitational energy of the system reaches unity, gas is removed from the clump
and core and star formation are quenched. The power of the radiation driven
winds has a strong dependence on metallicity and it increases with increasing
metallicity. Thus, winds from stars in the high metallicity models lead to a
rapid evacuation of the gas from the protocluster clump and to a reduced star
formation efficiency, as compared to their low metallicity counterparts. We
derive the metallicity dependent star formation efficiency per unit time in
this model as a function of the gas surface density Sigma_g. This is combined
with the molecular gas fraction in order to derive the dependence of the
surface density of star formation Sigma_SFR on Sigma_g. This feedback regulated
model of star formation reproduces very well the observed star formation laws
in galaxies extending from low gas surface densities up to the starburst
regime. Furthermore, the results show a dependence of Sigma_SFR on metallicity
over the entire range of gas surface densities, and can also explain part of
the scatter in the observations.

an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly
more than $d log n$ adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average. If
instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise

propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise

size of vesicles follows a log-normal distribution that changes over time due
to fusion processes, their spatial distribution gives rise to distinct
patterns. Their occurrence depends on the concentration of proteins which are
synthesized based on the transcriptional activities of some genes. Hence,
differences in these spatio-temporal vesicle patterns allow indirect
conclusions about the (unknown) impact of these genes.
  By means of agent-based computer simulations we are able to reproduce such
patterns on real temporal and spatial scales. Our modeling approach is based on
Brownian agents with an internal degree of freedom, $\theta$, that represents
the different modes of motion. Conditions inside the cell are modeled by an
effective potential that differs for agents dependent on their value $\theta$.
Agent's motion in this effective potential is modeled by an overdampted
Langevin equation, changes of $\theta$ are modeled as stochastic transitions
with values obtained from experiments, and fusion events are modeled as
space-dependent stochastic transitions. Our results for the spatio-temporal
vesicle patterns can be used for a statistical comparison with experiments. We
also derive hypotheses of how the silencing of some genes may affect the

of galaxy clusters and cluster mass is a vital part of the application of X-ray
galaxy cluster surveys to test cosmological models. An understanding of how
these relations evolve with redshift is just emerging from a number of
observational data sets.
  The current literature provides a diverse and inhomogeneous picture of
scaling relation evolution. We attempt to transform these results and the data
on recently discovered distant clusters into an updated and consistent
framework, and provide an overall view of scaling relation evolution.
  We study in particular the M-T, L_X-T, and M-L_X relation combining 14
published data sets supplemented with recently published data of distant
clusters and new results from follow-up observations of the XMM-Newton Distant
Cluster Project (XDCP).
  We find that the evolution of the M-T relation is consistent with the
self-similar prediction, while the evolution of X-ray luminosity for a given
temperature and mass for a given X-ray luminosity is slower than predicted. Our
best fit results for the evolution factor E(z)^alpha are alpha = -1.04+-0.07
for the M-T relation, alpha = -0.23+0.12-0.62 for the L-T relation, and alpha =
-0.93+0.62-0.12 for the M-L_X relation. We find that selection biases are the
most likely reason for apparent inconsistencies between different published
data sets.
  The new results provide the currently most robust calibration of
high-redshift cluster mass estimates based on X-ray luminosity and temperature
and help us to improve the prediction of the number of clusters to be found in
future galaxy cluster X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA. The comparison of
evolution results with hydrodynamical cosmological simulations suggests that
early preheating of the intracluster medium provides the most suitable scenario
to explain the observed evolution.

non-thermal pressure and the anisotropic shape of the gas distribution of the

entropy injection and transport, varying radiative cooling, star formation and
accompanying supernova feedback, cosmic rays, and energetic feedback from
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the gas kinetic-to-thermal pressure
ratio from internal bulk motions depends on the cluster mass, and increases in
the outer-cluster due to enhanced substructure, as does the asphericity of the
ICM gas. With only a ~5-10% correction to projected (observable) ellipticities,
we can infer the 3D ellipticities. Our simulated Y-M-slope roughly follows the
self-similar prediction, except for a steepening due to a deficit of gas in
lower mass clusters at low redshift in our AGN-feedback simulations. AGN
feedback enhances slightly the overall Y-M-scatter, from ~11% to ~13%, a
reflection of accretion history variations due to cluster merging. If we split
the cluster system into lower, middle and upper bands of both P_kin/P_th and
long-to-short axis ratio, we find a ~10% effect on Y-M. Identifying observable
second parameters related to internal bulk flows and anisotropy for
cluster-selection to minimize Y-M scatter in a ""fundamental plane"" would allow
tighter cosmological parameter constraints.

treasure-trove of cosmological information. Interpreting current experiments

the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect; the amplitude of which depends
critically on the average thermal pressure profile of galaxy groups and
clusters. To this end, we use a suite of SPH simulations that include radiative
cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and energetic feedback from active
galactic nuclei (AGN). We examine in detail how the pressure profile depends on
cluster radius, mass, and redshift and provide an empirical fitting function.
We employ three different approaches for calculating the tSZ power spectrum: an
analytical approach that uses our pressure profile fit, a semi-analytical
method of pasting our pressure fit onto simulated clusters, and a direct
numerical integration of our simulated volumes. We demonstrate that the
detailed structure of the intracluster medium and cosmic web affect the tSZ
power spectrum. In particular, the substructure and asphericity of clusters
increase the tSZ power spectrum by 10-20% at ell ~2000-8000, with most of the
additional power being contributed by substructures. The contributions to the
power spectrum from radii larger than R_500 is ~ 20% at ell = 3000, thus
clusters interiors (r < R_500) dominate the power spectrum amplitude at these
angular scales.

adopts a blastwave scheme for supernova feedback that generates galactic
outflows without explicit wind particles, a star formation recipe based on a
high gas density threshold, and high temperature metal cooling. ErisMC's main
progenitor at z=3 resembles a ""Lyman break"" galaxy of mass M_vir=2.4e11 M_sun,
virial radius R_vir=48 kpc, and star formation rate 18 M_sun/yr, and its
metal-enriched CGM extends to 200 (physical) kpc from its center. Approximately
41, 9, and 50 percent of all gas-phase metals at z=3 are locked in a hot (T>
3e5 K), warm (3e5 >T> 3e4 K), and cold (T< 3e4 K) medium, respectively. We
identify three sources of heavy elements: 1) the main host, responsible for 60%
of all the metals found within 3R_vir; 2) its satellite progenitors,
responsible for 28% of all the metals within 3R_vir, and for only 5% of those
beyond 3R_vir; and nearby dwarfs, which give origin to 12% of all the metals
within 3R_vir and 95% of those beyond 3R_vir. Late (z<5) galactic ""superwinds""
account for only 9% of all the metals observed beyond 2R_vir, the bulk having
been released at redshifts 5< z < 8 by early star formation and outflows. In
the CGM, lower overdensities are typically enriched by `older', colder metals.
Heavy elements are accreted onto Eris along filaments via low-metallicity cold
inflows, and are ejected hot via galactic outflows at a few hundred km/s. The
outflow mass-loading factor is of order unity for the main halo, but can exceed
10 for nearby dwarfs. We stress that our ""zoom-in"" simulation focuses on the

the EM algorithm, lead to optimization problems that are inherently nonconvex,

are able to both analyze the statistical error associated with any global
optimum, and more surprisingly, to prove that a simple algorithm based on
projected gradient descent will converge in polynomial time to a small
neighborhood of the set of all global minimizers. On the statistical side, we
provide nonasymptotic bounds that hold with high probability for the cases of
noisy, missing and/or dependent data. On the computational side, we prove that
under the same types of conditions required for statistical consistency, the
projected gradient descent algorithm is guaranteed to converge at a geometric
rate to a near-global minimizer. We illustrate these theoretical predictions
with simulations, showing close agreement with the predicted scalings.

fully understood. Under ideal MHD conditions, the removal of angular momentum
from the disk progenitor by the typically embedded magnetic field may prevent
the formation of a rotationally supported disk during the main protostellar
accretion phase of low mass stars. This has been known as the magnetic braking
problem and the most investigated mechanism to alleviate this problem and help
removing the excess of magnetic flux during the star formation process, the so
called ambipolar diffusion (AD), has been shown to be not sufficient to weaken
the magnetic braking at least at this stage of the disk formation. In this
work, motivated by recent progress in the understanding of magnetic
reconnection in turbulent environments, we appeal to the diffusion of magnetic
field mediated by magnetic reconnection as an alternative mechanism for
removing magnetic flux. We investigate numerically this mechanism during the
later phases of the protostellar disk formation and show its high efficiency.
By means 3D MHD simulations, we show that this mechanism is able to transport
magnetic flux to the outskirts of the disk progenitor at time scales compatible
with the collapse, allowing the formation of a rotationally supported disk
around the protostar of dimensions ~100 AU. Since MHD turbulence is expected to
be present in protostellar disks, this is a natural mechanism for removing
magnetic flux excess and allowing the formation of these disks. This mechanism
dismiss the necessity of postulating a hypothetical increase of the Ohmic
resistivity as discussed in the literature. Together with our earlier work
which showed that magnetic flux removal from molecular cloud cores is very
efficient, this work calls for reconsidering the relative role of AD for the
processes of star and planet formation.

Keck/NIRC2 laser guide star adaptive optics images obtained in 2007 and 2009 in
broad-band K and in a narrow-band filter centered on the 1-0 S(1) emission line
of molecular hydrogen allow us to identify the outflows from all three objects.
We also present new, seeing-limited data on the photometric evolution of the OO
Ser reflection nebula and re-analyze previously published data. We find that OO
Ser declined in brightness from its outburst peak in 1995 to about 2003, but
that this decline has recently stopped and actually reversed itself in some
areas of the reflection nebula. The morphology and proper motions of the shock
fronts MHO 2218 near EC 37 suggest that they all originate in EC 37 and that
this is an outflow seen nearly along its axis. We identify a molecular hydrogen
jet emerging from the cometary nebula EC 53. The star illuminating EC 53 is
periodically variable with a period of 543 days, and has a close-by,
non-variable companion at a projected distance of 92 AU. We argue that the
periodic variability is the result of accretion instabilities triggered by
another very close, not directly observable, binary companion and that EC 53
can be understood in the model of a multiple system developing into a
hierarchical configuration.

encounter an attentional mechanism that learns to select gazes so as to
minimize tracking uncertainty. Unlike in our previous work, we introduce gaze
selection strategies which operate in the presence of partial information and
on a continuous action space. We show that a straightforward extension of the
existing approach to the partial information setting results in poor
performance, and we propose an alternative method based on modeling the reward
surface as a Gaussian Process. This approach gives good performance in the
presence of partial information and allows us to expand the action space from a

encompasses three main components. We must know: (1) the primordial population

distribution as stars form and natal clusters disperse, and (3) the role of
binary stellar evolution. In this article I review the most prominent theories
for binary formation: turbulent core fragmentation, disk fragmentation, and
competitive accretion. I argue that turbulent core fragmentation at all masses,
with disk fragmentation added in at the upper end of the mass spectrum, might
explain the trend towards increasing multiplicity for higher mass stars. In
addition, I provide a brief overview of the observational statistics and of
some of the important processes that modify the primordial distribution of

R$_\odot$ from the solar surface, and there are two most probable critical
heights, at which a prominence is much likely to get unstable; the primary one
is 0.13 R$_\odot$ and the secondary one is 0.19 R$_\odot$. (2) There exists
upper limit for the erupting velocity of eruptive prominences (EPs), which
decreases following a power law with increasing height and mass; the kinetic
energy of EPs accordingly has an upper limit too, which decreases as critical
height increases. (3) Stable prominences (SPs) are generally longer and heavier

calculated for both single-layer and multi-layer systems and the unstable

is found to precede the out-of-plane instability. The unstable wave-vector is
found to be approximately twice the Fermi wave-vector of one of the subbands at
a time and can change discontinuously as a function of density and dipolar
interaction strength. In multi-layer configurations, we find a large
enhancement of density wave instability driven by dilute quasiparticles in the
first excited subband. Finally, we provide a simple qualitative description of
the phase diagrams using a RPA-like approach. Compared to previous works done
within the RPA approximation, we find that inclusion of exchange interactions
stabilize the normal liquid phase further and increase the critical dipolar
interaction strength corresponding to the onset of density-wave instability by
over a factor of two.

will drive a given dynamic system from a given initial state to a given target

challenging problem in optimal control theory for which closed-form solutions
exist only for a few systems of small dimensions. This paper presents a very
generic solution to the minimum-time problem for arbitrary discrete-time linear
systems. It is a numerical solution based on sparse optimization, that is the
minimization of the number of nonzero elements in the state sequence over a
fixed control horizon. We consider both single input and multiple inputs

linear multi-agent systems with undirected communication topologies. It is
assumed that the agents have identical nominal dynamics while subject to
different norm-bounded parameter uncertainties, leading to weakly heterogeneous
multi-agent systems. Distributed controllers are designed for both continuous-
and discrete-time multi-agent systems, based on the relative states of
neighboring agents and a subset of absolute states of the agents. It is shown
for both the continuous- and discrete-time cases that the distributed robust
control problems under such controllers in the sense of quadratic stability are
equivalent to the $H_\infty$ control problems of a set of decoupled linear
systems having the same dimensions as a single agent. A two-step algorithm is
presented to construct the distributed controller for the continuous-time case,
which does not involve any conservatism and meanwhile decouples the feedback
gain design from the communication topology. Furthermore, a sufficient
existence condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities is derived for the
distributed discrete-time controller. Finally, the distributed robust
$H_\infty$ control problems of uncertain linear multi-agent systems subject to
external disturbances are discussed.

valid quantum theory of gravity must allow for the existence of light (compared
to the Planck scale) fermions, since we observe these in our universe. Within
the effective theory framework, we can thus show that UV completions for

wind. MCs transport magnetic flux and helicity away from the Sun. These
structures are not stationary but feature temporal evolution as they propagate
in the solar wind. Simplified analytical models are frequently used for the
description of MCs, and fit certain observational data well. The goal of the
present study is to investigate numerically the validity of an analytical model
which is widely used for the description of MCs, and to determine under which
conditions this model's implied assumptions cease to be valid. A numerical
approach is applied. Analytical solutions that have been derived in previous
studies are implemented in a \textbf{3-D magnetohydrodynamic} simulation code
as initial conditions. Initially, the analytical model represents the main
observational features of the MCs. However, these characteristics prevail only
if the structure moves with a velocity close to the velocity of the background
flow. In this case an MC's evolution can quite accurately be described using an
analytic, self-similar approach. The dynamics of the magnetic structures which
move with a velocity significantly above or below that of the velocity of the
solar wind is investigated in detail. Besides the standard case in which MCs
only expand and propagate in the solar wind, the case of an MC rotating around
its axis of symmetry is also considered, and the resulting influence on the
MC's dynamics is studied.

Unfortunately, the existing techniques and infrastructure that are still used

ill-suited for these new patterns of content exchange. In this paper, we take a
first step towards addressing this situation by introducing WebCloud, a content
distribution system for online social networking sites that works by re-
purposing web browsers to help serve content. In other words, when a user
browses content, WebCloud tries to fetch it from one of that user's friend's
browsers, instead of from the social networking site. The result is a more
direct exchange of content ; essentially, WebCloud leverages the spatial and
temporal locality of interest between social network users. Because WebCloud is
built using techniques already present in many web browsers, it can be applied
today to many social networking sites. We demonstrate the practicality of
WebCloud with microbenchmarks, simulations, and a prototype deployment.

matrix-valued Schur class over a finitely-connected planar domain and (2) the
matrix-valued version of the constrained Hardy algebra (bounded analytic
functions on the unit disk with derivative at the origin constrained to have
zero value). Emphasis is on examples where the matrix-valued version is not
obtained as a simple higher-multiplicity tensoring of the scalar-valued
version.

evolution typical of many-bodied coupled networks can be transformed into a
simple, relaxation-like dynamics, by relying on periodic dephasings of the
off-diagonal density matrix elements. This represents a case of ""quantum Zeno
effects"", where unitary evolutions are inhibited by projective measurements. We
present here a novel exploitation of these effects, by showing that a
relaxation-like behaviour is endowed to the polarization transfers occurring
within a N-spin coupled network. Experimental implementations and coupling
constant determinations for complex spin-coupling topologies, are thus
demonstrated within the field of liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

The model system consists of two different particles with spin-1/2 and spin-1,
which are randomly distributed on the lattice. It has been considered only spin
nearest-neighbor exchange interactions with $J>0$. This system can represent a
disordered magnetic binary alloy $A_{x}B_{1-x}$, obtained from the high
temperature quenching of a liquid mixture. The results were obtained by the use
of Monte Carlo simulations for several lattice sizes $L$, temperature $T$ and
concentration $x$ of ions $A$ with spin-1/2. We found its critical temperature,
through the reduced fourth-order Binder cumulant for the several values of the
concentration $x$ of particles (spin-1/2, spin-1), and also the magnetization,
the susceptibility and the specific heat as a function of temperature $T$.

neuron oscillators. We focus on the design of minimum-power current stimuli
that elicit spikes in neurons at desired times. We furthermore take the
charge-balanced constraint into account because in practice undesirable side
effects may occur due to the accumulation of electric charge resulting from
external stimuli. Charge-balanced minimum-power controls are derived for a
general phase model using the maximum principle, where the cases with unbounded
and bounded control amplitude are examined. The latter is of practical
importance since phase models are more accurate for weak forcing. The developed
optimal control strategies are then applied to both mathematically ideal and
experimentally observed phase models to demonstrate their applicability,
including the phase model for the widely studied Hodgkin-Huxley equations.

stage, a few tens of Mars-sized protoplanets collide with one another to form
terrestrial planets. Almost all previous studies on the orbital and accretional
evolution of protoplanets in this stage have been based on the assumption of
perfect accretion, where two colliding protoplanets always merge. However,
recent impact simulations have shown that collisions among protoplanets are not
always merging events, that is, two colliding protoplanets sometimes move apart
after the collision (hit-and-run collision). As a first step towards studying
the effects of such imperfect accretion of protoplanets on terrestrial planet
formation, we investigated the merging criteria for collisions of rocky
protoplanets. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method, we
performed more than 1000 simulations of giant impacts with various parameter
sets, such as the mass ratio of protoplanets, $\gamma$, the total mass of two
protoplanets, $M_{\rm T}$, the impact angle, $\theta$, and the impact velocity,
$v_{\rm imp}$. We investigated the critical impact velocity, $v_{\rm cr}$, at
the transition between merging and hit-and-run collisions. We found that the
normalized critical impact velocity, $v_{\rm cr}/v_{\rm esc}$, depends on
$\gamma$ and $\theta$, but does not depend on $M_{\rm T}$, where $v_{\rm esc}$
is the two-body escape velocity. We derived a simple formula for $v_{\rm
cr}/v_{\rm esc}$ as a function of $\gamma$ and $\theta$, and applied it to the
giant impact events obtained by \textit{N}-body calculations in the previous
studies. We found that 40% of these events should not be merging events.

parameterized with its closest point projection $\pi$ over a certain collection

on the background mesh. For $\Gamma_h$, we select the edges that have both
vertices on one side of $\Gamma$ and belong to a triangle that has a vertex on
the other side. By imposing restrictions on the size of triangles near the
curve and by requesting that certain angles in the mesh be strictly acute, we
prove that $\pi:\Gamma_h\rightarrow\Gamma$ is a homeomorphism, that it is $C^1$
on each edge in $\Gamma_h$ and provide bounds for the Jacobian of the
parameterization. The assumptions on the background mesh are both easy to
satisfy in practice and conveniently verified in computer implementations. The
parameterization analyzed here was previously proposed by the authors and
applied to the construction of high-order curved finite elements on a class of
planar piecewise $C^2$-curves.
