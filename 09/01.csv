selected field at the edge of the Pleiades cluster. The field was observed in
the period 2007 - 2010 with three different CCD-cameras at the University
Observatory Jena with telescopes from 25 to 90 cm. The flare duration is almost
one hour with an amplitude in the R-band of about 1.08 mag. The location of the
flare star in a color-magnitude diagram is consistent with age and distance of
the Pleiades. In the optical PSF of the flare star there are two 2MASS objects
(unresolved in most images in the optical Jena PSF), so it is not yet known
which one of them is responsible for this flare. The BVRIJHK colors yield
spectral types of M1 and M2 with extinction being A_V=0.231+/-0.024 mag and
A_V=0.266+/-0.020 for those two stars, consistent with the Pleiades cluster.

early-type (13/29) hosts, with the remaining three hosts having indeterminate
classifications. AGNs hosted by early-type galaxies have on average greater
luminosity than those hosted by spiral galaxies. Disturbances, such as tidal
tails, shells, star-forming knots, and asymmetries are seen as signposts of
interaction/merger activity. Disturbances such as these were found in 17 of the
29 objects and are evenly distributed among early-type and spiral galaxies. Two
of these systems are clearly merging with their companions. Compared to other
AGN of similar luminosity and redshift these PSQs have a higher fraction of
early-type hosts and disturbances. Our most luminous objects with disturbed
early-type host galaxies appear to be consistent with merger products. Thus,
these luminous disturbed galaxies may represent a phase in an evolutionary
scenario for merger driven activity and of hierarchical galaxy evolution. Our
less luminous objects appear to be consistent with Seyfert galaxies not
requiring triggering by major mergers. Many of these Seyferts are barred spiral
galaxies.

In this paper we present a theoretical framework to study how the overhead can

do not treat each buffer-map as an isolated data block, but consider the
correlations between the sequentially exchanged buffer-maps. Under this

of the schemes is proved mathematically. Moreover, we derive the theoretical

Furthermore, by combining with the traditional compression methods (on

height h' over set Y. For Y we may take the set of words of length <d. Such Y
is called a Shirshov's base of algebra A."" Shirshov's original proof was purely
combinatorical, but did not provide a reasonable upper estimate for the height.
Kolotov obtained an estimate for h(A) < s^(s^m) (m = deg(A), and s is the
number of generators) in 1981. I. Zelmanov asked for an exponential bound in
the Dniester Notebook. In 2011 Belov and Kharitonov get the estimate 2^87 m^(12
log_3(m)+48) l. This result answered Zelmanov question that in fact Shirshov's
height has subexponential growth. As a corollary from Amitzur-Levitsky theorem
we have the lower estimate of h(A) which is ((m/2)^2 - 1)(s - 1) + 1 . We
consider essential height over the sets of small words to obtain exact
estimations of Shirshov's height. Define by n-divisible such word w that may be
constructed as w = v u_1 u_2...u_n, where for every i from 2 to n u_(i-1) is
lexicographically less than u_i. The main results of the paper are the
following: Let M be the set of non-n-dividable words with: 1) finite essential
height over the words degree 2, then the number of lexicographically comparable
words with period 2 is less than (2l-1)(n-1)(n-2)/2; 2) finite essential height
over the words degree 3, then the number of lexicographically comparable words
with period 3 is less than (2l-1)(n-1)(n-2); 3) finite essential height over
the words degree (n-1), then the number of lexicographically comparable words
with period (n-1) is less than (l-2)(n-1). The case of the words of length 2 is
synthesized to the proof of the exponential estimation in Shirshov's Height
theorem.

factorization. They are insufficient to model (i) complex interactions between

Using these InfTucker, we conduct Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature

both continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous
Bayesian models on matrices and tensors, our models are based on latent
Gaussian or $t$ processes with nonlinear covariance functions. To efficiently
learn the InfTucker from data, we develop a variational inference technique on

independent of the details of how deposited energy is redistributed in the
medium, which is largely determined by transport coefficients such as shear
viscosity. Thus by matching the distribution of momentum associated with the
secondary jet in such measurements to the thermal distribution of the
underlying medium, one can obtain a model independent estimate on the amount of
parton shower energy deposited.

However, the critical temperature is suppressed to zero at half-filling, where
long-range charge-density-wave order also appears, degenerate with
superconductivity. This paper presents Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo

destination node with the help of several layers of relay nodes. Recent work by
Avestimehr et al. has approximated the capacity of this network up to an
additive gap. The communication scheme achieving this capacity approximation is
based on compress-and-forward, resulting in noise accumulation as the messages
traverse the network. As a consequence, the approximation gap increases
linearly with the network depth.
  This paper develops a computation alignment strategy that can approach the
capacity of a class of layered, time-varying wireless relay networks up to an
approximation gap that is independent of the network depth. This strategy is
based on the compute-and-forward framework, which enables relays to decode
deterministic functions of the transmitted messages. Alone, compute-and-forward
is insufficient to approach the capacity as it incurs a penalty for
approximating the wireless channel with complex-valued coefficients by a
channel with integer coefficients. Here, this penalty is circumvented by
carefully matching channel realizations across time slots to create
integer-valued effective channels that are well-suited to compute-and-forward.
Unlike prior constant gap results, the approximation gap obtained in this paper
also depends closely on the fading statistics, which are assumed to be i.i.d.
Rayleigh.

an adversary to ask queries from an oracle. Security is then defined by
requiring that as long as the queries satisfy some constraint, there is some
problem the adversary cannot solve, such as compute a certain piece of
information. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally new model of quantum
attacks on classical cryptographic protocols, where the adversary is allowed to
ask several classical queries in quantum superposition. This is a strictly
stronger attack than the standard one, and we consider the security of several
primitives in this model. We show that a secret-sharing scheme that is secure
with threshold $t$ in the standard model is secure against superposition
attacks if and only if the threshold is lowered to $t/2$. We use this result to
give zero-knowledge proofs for all of NP in the common reference string model.
While our protocol is classical, it is sound against a cheating unbounded
quantum prover and computational zero-knowledge even if the verifier is allowed
a superposition attack. Finally, we consider multiparty computation and show
that for the most general type of attack, simulation based security is not
possible. However, putting a natural constraint on the adversary, we show a
non-trivial example of a protocol that can indeed be simulated.

edge region of tokamaks and other magnetic confinement devices, as well as to
internal transport barriers. The result is a practical set equations that is
valid for large perturbation amplitudes [q{\delta}{\psi}/T = O(1), where
{\delta}{\psi} = {\delta}{\phi} - v_par {\delta}A_par/c], which is
straightforward to implement numerically, and which has straightforward
expressions for its conservation properties. Here, q is the particle charge,
{\delta}{\phi} and {\delta}A_par are the perturbed electrostatic and parallel
magnetic potentials, v_par is the parallel velocity, c is the speed of light,
and T is the temperature. The derivation is based on the quantity
{\epsilon}:=({\rho}/{\lambda})q{\delta}{\psi}/T << 1 as the small expansion
parameter, where {\rho} is the gyroradius and {\lambda} is the perpendicular
wavelength. Physically, this ordering requires that the E\times B velocity and
the component of the parallel velocity perpendicular to the equilibrium
magnetic field are small compared to the thermal velocity. For nonlinear
fluctuations saturated at ""mixing-length"" levels (i.e., at a level such that
driving gradients in profile quantities are locally flattened), {\epsilon} is
of order {\rho}/L, where L is the equilibrium profile scale length, for all
scales {\lambda} ranging from {\rho} to L. This is true even though
q{\delta}{\psi}/T = O(1) for {\lambda} ~ L. Significant additional
simplifications result from ordering L/R =O({\epsilon}), where R is the spatial
scale of variation of the magnetic field. We argue that these orderings are
well satisfied in strong-gradient regions, such as edge and screapeoff layer
regions and internal transport barriers in tokamaks, and anticipate that our
equations will be useful as a basis for simulation models for these regions.

recently. A particularly interesting approach is link traversal based query
execution which proposes to integrate the traversal of data links into the
construction of query results. Hence -in contrast to traditional query
execution paradigms- this approach does not assume a fixed set of relevant data
sources beforehand; instead, it discovers data on the fly and, thus, enables
applications to tap the full potential of the Web.
  While several authors study possibilities to implement the idea of link
traversal based query execution and to optimize query execution in this
context, no work exists that discusses the theoretical foundations of the
approach in general. Our paper fills this gap.
  We introduce a well-defined semantics for queries that may be executed using
the link traversal based approach. Based on this semantics we formally analyze
properties of such queries. In particular, we study the computability of
queries as well as the implications of querying a potentially infinite Web of
Linked Data. Our results show that query computation in general is not
guaranteed to terminate and that for any given query it is undecidable whether
the execution terminates. Furthermore, we define an abstract execution model
that captures the integration of link traversal into the query execution
process. Based on this model we prove the soundness and completeness of link
traversal based query execution and analyze an existing implementation
approach..

alpha-process elements carry a wealth of information on the star formation

[alpha/Fe] with the SFH timescale, correlating large abundance ratios with
short-lived SFH. We provide an empirical correlation between [alpha/Fe]
(measured from spectral indices) and the SFH (determined via a non-parametric
spectral-fitting method). We offer an empirical version of the iconic outline
of Thomas et al. (2005), relating star formation timescale with galaxy mass,
although our results suggest, in contrast, a significant population of old
(>10Gyr) stars even for the lowest mass ellipticals. In addition, the abundance
ratio is found to be strongly correlated with the time to build up the stellar
component, showing that the highest [alpha/Fe] (>+0.2) are attained by galaxies
with the shortest half-mass formation time (<2Gyr), or equivalently, with the
smallest (<40%) fraction of populations younger than 10Gyr. These observational
results support the standard hypothesis that star formation incorporates the
Fe-enriched interstellar medium into stars, lowering the high abundance ratio
of the old populations.

This conclusion applies in particular to the spectral endpoint, where also the
additional fermionic contributions are not large enough to increase the flux
significantly. When searching for the line signal originating from Z^1 Z^1
annihilations, this is actually a perfect situation, since the continuum signal
can be regarded as background to the smoking gun signature of a peak in the
photon flux at an energy that is nearly equal to the mass of the dark matter

luminosity of an old stellar population. Directly estimating the number of
low-mass stars from integrated flux measurements of old stellar systems is
therefore possible but very challenging given the numerous variables that can
affect the light at the percent level. Here we present a new population
synthesis model created specifically for the purpose of measuring the low-mass
initial mass function (IMF) down to ~0.1Msun for metal-rich stellar populations
with ages in the range 3-13.5 Gyr. Our fiducial model is based on the synthesis
of three separate isochrones and a combination of optical and near-IR empirical
stellar libraries in order to produce integrated light spectra over the
wavelength interval 0.35mu<lambda<2.4mu at a resolving power of R~2000. New
synthetic stellar atmospheres and spectra have been computed in order to model
the spectral variations due to changes in individual elemental abundances
including C, N, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and generic alpha elements. We
demonstrate the power of combining blue spectral features with surface
gravity-sensitive near-IR features in order to simultaneously constrain the
low-mass IMF, stellar population age, metallicity, and abundance pattern from
integrated light measurements. Finally, we show that the shape of the low-mass
IMF can also be directly constrained by employing a suite of surface
gravity-sensitive spectral features, each of which is most sensitive to a
particular mass interval.

However, these data alone cannot rule out the single AGN scenario where the
narrow emission-line region associated with the secondary is photoionized by
the broad-line AGN in the primary. Our new EVLA images at 1.4, 5.0, and 8.5 GHz

of host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes that
regulate star formation. We derive the total stellar mass fraction f_star as a
function of halo mass M500c from z=0.2 to z=1 using two complementary methods.
First, we derive f_star using a statistical Halo Occupation Distribution model
jointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar mass
function. This method enables us to probe f_star over a much wider halo mass
range than with group or cluster catalogs. Second, we derive f_star at group
scales using a COSMOS X-ray group catalog and we show that the two methods
agree to within 30%. We quantify the systematic uncertainty on f_star using
abundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty on
f_star (~10%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellar
mass measurements (~45% excluding IMF uncertainties). Assuming a Chabrier IMF,
we find 0.012<f_star<0.025 at M500c=10^13 Msun and 0.0057<f_star<0.015 at
M500c=10^14 Msun. These values are significantly lower than previously
published estimates. We investigate the cause of this difference and find that
previous work has overestimated f_star due to a combination of inaccurate
stellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies in
groups are early type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. Contrary to
previous claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f_star is always
significantly lower than f_gas for halos above 10^13 Msun. Combining our
results with recently published gas mas fractions, we find a shortfall in
f_star+f_gas at R500c compared to the cosmic mean. This shortfall varies with
halo mass and becomes larger towards lower halos masses.

short bursting sources have higher temperatures and normal neutrons in the

hosts of the PRGs (e.g. tidal tails, shells, bridges, etc.) are up to 2
magnitudes brighter than those present in their quiescent counterparts. Indeed,
if we consider the same surface brightness limits, the fraction of disturbed

the coordinates of the most probable optical counterpart of each HI line
detection, and a separate compilation provides a crossmatch to identifications

rho_sd=0.003-0.5 Msun/pc^3. Star formation occurs in very dense, cold,
self-gravitating clouds. Turbulence, driven by momentum feedback from supernova
events, destroys bound clouds and puffs up the disk vertically. Time-dependent
radiative heating (FUV) offsets gas cooling. We use our simulations to test a
new theory for self-regulated star formation. Consistent with this theory, the
disks evolve to a state of vertical dynamical equilibrium and thermal
equilibrium with both warm and cold phases. The range of star formation surface
densities and midplane thermal pressures is Sigma_SFR ~ 0.0001 - 0.01
Msun/kpc^2/yr and P_th/k_B ~ 100 -10000 cm^-3 K. In agreement with
observations, turbulent velocity dispersions are ~7 km/s and the ratio of the
total (effective) to thermal pressure is P_tot/P_th~4-5, across this whole
range. We show that Sigma_SFR is not well correlated with Sigma alone, but
rather with Sigma*(rho_sd)^1/2, because the vertical gravity from stars and
dark matter dominates in outer disks. We also find that Sigma_SFR has a strong,
nearly linear correlation with P_tot, which itself is within ~13% of the
dynamical-equilibrium estimate P_tot,DE. The quantitative relationships we find
between Sigma_SFR and the turbulent and thermal pressures show that star
formation is highly efficient for energy and momentum production, in contrast
to the low efficiency of mass consumption. Star formation rates adjust until
the ISM's energy and momentum losses are replenished by feedback within a
dynamical time.

version which demands the least possible fermionic content to account for the
whole established phenomenology for the well known particles and interactions.
Nevertheless, in its original form the minimal 3-3-1 model was proposed with a
set of three scalar triplets and one sextet in order to yield the spontaneous
breaking of the gauge symmetry and generate the observed fermion masses. Such a
huge scalar sector turns the task of clearly identifying the physical scalar
spectrum a clumsy labor. It not only adds an obstacle for the development of
its phenomenology but implies a scalar potential plagued with new free coupling
constants. In this work we show that the framework of the minimal 3-3-1 model
can be built with only two scalar triplets, but still triggering the desired
pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking and generating the correct fermion
masses. We present the exact physical spectrum and also show all the
interactions involving the scalars, obtaining a neat minimal 3-3-1 model far
more suited for phenomenological studies at the current Large Hadron Collider.

Roughly speaking, given a c\`adl\`ag function $f$, its truncated variation is
""the total variation which does not pay attention to small changes of $f$,
below some threshold $c>0$"". The very basic consequence of such approach is
that contrary to the total variation, $TV^c$ is always finite. This is
appealing to the stochastic analysis where so-far large classes of processes,
like semimartingales or diffusions, could not be studied with the total
variation. Recently in [6], another characterization of $TV^c$ was found.
Namely $TV^c$ is the smallest total variation of a function which approximates
$f$ uniformly with accuracy $c/2$. Due to these properties we envisage that
$TV^c$ might be a useful concept to the theory of processes.
  For this reason we determine some properties of $TV^c$ for some well-known
processes. In course of our research we discover intimate connections with
already known concepts of the stochastic processes theory.
  Firstly, for semimartingales we proved that $TV^c$ is of order $c^{-1}$ and
the normalized truncated variation converges almost surely to the quadratic
variation of the semimartingale as $c\searrow0$. Secondly, we studied the rate
of this convergence. As this task was much more demanding we narrowed to the
class of diffusions (with some mild additional assumptions). We obtained the
weak convergence to a so-called Ocone martingale. These results can be viewed
as some kind of large numbers theorem and the corresponding central limit
theorem.
  All the results above were obtained in a functional setting, viz. we worked
with processes describing the growth of the truncated variation in time.
Moreover, in the same respect we also treated two closely related quantities -
the so-called upward truncated variation and downward truncated variation.

representation ring of G over a suitable field k. In this preprint we construct
a ring homomorphism from the mod 2 Milnor K-theory k_*(F) to the graded ring gr
R(G, k) associated to Grothendieck's \gamma-filtration. We study this map in
particular cases, as well as a related map involving the W-group of F rather
than G. The latter is an isomorphism in all cases considered.
  Naturally this echoes the Milnor conjecture (now a theorem), which states
that k_*(F) is isomorphic to the mod 2 cohomology of the absolute Galois group
G, and to the graded Witt ring gr W(F).
  The machinery developed to obtain the above results seems to have independent
interest in algebraic topology. We are led to construct an analog of the
classical Chern character, which does not involve complex vector bundles and
Chern classes but rather real vector bundles and Stiefel-Whitney classes. Thus
we show the existence of a ring homomorphism whose source is the graded ring
associated to the real K-theory ring K(X) of the topological space X, again
with respect to the \gamma -filtration, and whose target is a certain
subquotient of the mod 2 cohomology of X.
  In order to define this subquotient, we introduce a collection of
distinguished Steenrod operations. They are related to Stiefel-Whitney classes
by combinatorial identities.

the discovery by R. Stubbings of a pre-eruption rise starting 18 days before
the eruption, peaking 1.1 mag brighter than its long-time average, and then
fading back towards quiescence 4 days before the eruption. This unique and
mysterious behavior is only the fourth known anticipatory rise closely spaced
before a nova eruption. We present 19 timings of photometric minima from 1986
to February 2011, where the orbital period is fast increasing with
P/dot{P}=313,000 yrs. From 2008-2011, T Pyx had a small change in this rate of
increase, so that the orbital period at the time of eruption was
0.07622950+-0.00000008 days. This strong and steady increase of the orbital
period can only come from mass transfer, for which we calculate a rate of
1.7-3.5x10^-7 Mo/yr. We report 6116 magnitudes between 1890 and 2011, for an
average B=15.59+-0.01 from 1967-2011, which allows for an eruption in 2011 if
the blue flux is nearly proportional to the accretion rate. The
ultraviolet-optical-infrared spectral energy distribution is well fit by a
power law with flux proportional to nu^1.0, although the narrow ultraviolet
region has a tilt with a fit of \nu^{1/3}. We prove that most of the T Pyx
light is not coming from a disk, or any superposition of blackbodies, but
rather is coming from some nonthermal source.

the simple model with overlapping conduction and valence bands, each with

  arXiv admin note: had substantial text overlap with arXiv:0901.3730",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Searching for an intermediate-range force has been considerable interests in
gravity experiments. In this paper, aiming at a scalar-tensor theory with an
intermediate-range force, we have derived the metric and equations of motion
(EOMs) in the first post-Newtonian (1PN) approximation for general matter
without specific equation of state and $N$ point masses firstly. Subsequently,
the secular periastron precession $\dot{\omega}$ of binary pulsars in harmonic
coordinates is given. After that, $\dot{\omega}$ of four binary pulsars data
(PSR B1913+16, PSR B1534+12, PSR J0737-3039 and PSR B2127+11C) have been used
to constrain the intermediate-range force, namely, the parameters $\alpha$ and
$\lambda$. $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ respectively represent the strength of the
intermediate-range force coupling and its length scale. The limits from four
binary pulsars data are respectively $\lambda=(4.95\pm0.02)\times10^{8}$m and
$\alpha=(2.30\pm0.01)\times10^{-8}$ if $\beta=1$ where $\beta$ is a parameter
like standard parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\beta_{PPN}$. When three
degrees of freedom ($\alpha$, $\lambda$ and $\bar{\beta}\equiv\beta-1$) in
1$\sigma$ confidence level are considered, it yields
$\alpha=(4.21\pm0.01)\times10^{-4}$, $\lambda=(4.51\pm0.01)\times10^{7}$m and
$\bar{\beta}=(-3.30\pm0.01)\times10^{-3}$. Through our research on the
scalar-tensor theory with the intermediate-range force, it shows that the
parameter $\alpha$ is directly related to the parameter $\gamma$
($\alpha=(1-\gamma)/(1+\gamma)$). Thus, this presents the constraints on
$1-\gamma$ by binary pulsars which is about $10^{-4}$ for three degrees of
freedom.

considered. It assumes that individuals (operators) governing the dynamics of a
certain system try to follow an optimal strategy in controlling its motion but
fail to do this perfectly because similar strategies are indistinguishable for
them. The main attention is focused on the systems where the optimal dynamics
implies the stability of a certain equilibrium point in the corresponding phase
space. In such systems the fuzzy rationality gives rise to some neighborhood of
the equilibrium point, the region of dynamical traps, wherein each point is
regarded as an equilibrium one by the operators. So when the system enters this
region and while it is located in it, maybe for a long time, the operator
control is suspended. To elucidate a question as to whether the dynamical traps
on their own can cause emergent phenomena the stochastic factors are eliminated
from consideration. In this case the system can leave the dynamical trap region
only because of the mismatch between actions of different operators. By way of
example, a chain of oscillators with dynamical traps is analyzed numerically.
As demonstrated the dynamical traps do induce instability and complex behavior
of such systems.

these observations, we propose that the $\gamma$-ray variability and flares are
due to statistical fluctuations of knots that can accelerate electrons to
$\sim$PeV energies. The maximum achievable energy of electrons is adopted to be
proportional to the size of the knot, which is assumed to follow a power-law
distribution. Thus the low energy electron flux will be stable due to the large
number of small knots, while the high energy electron flux may experience large
fluctuations. Monte Carlo realization of such a picture can reproduce the
observational data quite well given proper model parameters.

the simultaneous evolution of the waveform and of the timelike matching
surface. This allows us to produce a full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform of
the l=2, m=2,-2 modes of the gravitational waveform of an equal-mass

simulations well in phase, though less well in amplitude for the inspiral. As a
second application of this method, we study a merger of black holes with spins
antialigned in the orbital plane (the ""superkick"" configuration). During the
ringdown of the superkick, the phases of the mass- and current-quadrupole
radiation become locked together, because they evolve at the same quasinormal
mode frequencies. We argue that this locking begins during merger, and we show
that if the spins of the black holes evolve via geodetic precession in the
perturbed black-hole spacetime of our model, then the spins precess at the
orbital frequency during merger. In turn, this gives rise to the correct
behavior of the radiation, and produces a kick similar to that observed in
numerical simulations.

the spheroids, we carefully consider the variation of the bulge-to-total
luminosity ratio of the galaxy populations and the M_bh/M_sph ratio, which,

mass functions derived from the galaxy luminosity and mass functions show very
good agreement, both in shape and in normalization. The resultant SMBH mass
function and integrated mass density for the local epoch (z~0) match well those

cosmic downsizing, the upper end of the mass function remains roughly constant

learn a full Euclidean metric through an expectation-minimization (EM)

sharp, high conductance on/off transition by exploiting the sharp step in the
density of states at band edges. The nature of the density of states, is
strongly dependent on quantum dimensionality. To know the current/voltage curve
requires us to specify both the n-side dimensionality and the p-side
dimensionality of pn junctions. We find that a typical bulk 3d-3d tunneling pn
junction has only a quadratic turn-on function, while a pn junction consisting
of two overlapping quantum wells (2d-2d) would have the preferred step function
response. We consider nine physically distinguishable possibilities: 3d-3d,
2d-2dedge, 1d-1dend, 2d-3d, 1d-2d, 0d-1d, 2d-2dface, 1d-1dedge and 0d-0d. Thus

junctions.
  Quantum confinement, or reduced dimensionality on each side of a pn junction
has the added benefit of significantly increasing the tunnel conductance at the
turn-on threshold.

through side channels can be used to recover important semantic information.
For instance, attackers can find out which website, or which page on a website,
a user is accessing simply by monitoring the packet size distribution. We show
that traffic analysis is even a greater threat to privacy than previously
thought by introducing a new attack that can be carried out remotely. In
particular, we show that, to perform traffic analysis, adversaries do not need
to directly observe the traffic patterns. Instead, they can gain sufficient
information by sending probes from a far-off vantage point that exploits a
queuing side channel in routers. To demonstrate the threat of such remote
traffic analysis, we study a remote website detection attack that works against
home broadband users. Because the remotely observed traffic patterns are more
noisy than those obtained using previous schemes based on direct local traffic
monitoring, we take a dynamic time warping (DTW) based approach to detecting
fingerprints from the same website. As a new twist on website fingerprinting,
we consider a website detection attack, where the attacker aims to find out
whether a user browses a particular web site, and its privacy implications. We
show experimentally that, although the success of the attack is highly
variable, depending on the target site, for some sites very low error rates. We
also show how such website detection can be used to deanonymize message board

several studies about the problems arising during the implementation of an ERP
system. The main problem areas are around the complexity of ERP systems. One
vision to overcome some of these problems is federated ERP. Federated ERP
systems are built of components from different vendors, which are distributed
within a network. All components act as one single ERP system from the user
perspective. The decreased complexity of such a system would require lower
installation and maintenance cost. Additional, only the components which are
needed to cover the company's business processes would be used. Several
theories around this concept exist, but a feasibility assessment of developing
a federated ERP system has not been done yet. Based on a literary analysis of
existing methods for feasibility studies, this paper is applying strategic
planning concepts and referential data from the traditional ERP development to
provide a first assessment of the overall feasibility of developing a platform
for federated ERP systems. An analytical hierarchical approach is used to
define effort and effect related criteria and their domain values. The
assessment as the criteria is done in comparison to the development of a
classical ERP system. Using the developed criteria, a net present value
calculation is done. The calculation of the net present value is done on an
overall, not company specific level. In order to estimate the weighted average
cost of capital, the values from successful software companies are used as a

entanglement entropy exist: one comes from conformal field theory (CFT), and
the other is for entanglement support of matrix product state (MPS)
approximation. They indicates that the matrix dimension of the MPS represents a
length scale of spin correlation. On the other hand, the quantum spin-chain
models can be mapped onto two-dimensional (2D) classical ones. Motivated by the
scaling and the mapping, we introduce new entanglement entropy for 2D classical
spin configuration as well as entanglement spectrum, and examine their basic
properties in Ising and 3-state Potts models on the square lattice. They are
defined by the singular values of the reduced density matrix for a Monte Carlo
snapshot. We find scaling relations concerned with length scales in the
snapshot at $T_{c}$. There, the spin configuration is fractal, and various
sizes of ordered clusters coexist. Then, the singular values automatically
decompose the original snapshot into a set of images with different length
scale. This is the origin of the scaling. In contrast to the MPS scaling,
long-range spin correlation can be described by only few singular values.
Furthermore, we find multiple gaps in the entanglement spectrum, and in
contrast to standard topological phases, the low-lying entanglement levels
below the gap represent spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on these
observations, we discuss about the amount of information contained in one
snapshot in a viewpoint of the CFT scaling.

converting two popular online learning algorithms into their differentially

understanding of the crystallization process is still elusive. By computer
simulations of the hard-sphere model we reveal the mechanism by which thermal
fluctuations drive the transition from the supercooled liquid state to the
crystal state. In particular we show that fluctuations in bond orientational
order trigger the nucleation process, contrary to the common belief that the
transition is initiated by density fluctuations. Moreover, the analysis of bond
orientational fluctuations shows that these not only act as seeds of the
nucleation process, but also i) determine the particular polymorph which is to
be nucleated from them and ii) at high density favour the formation of fivefold
structures which can frustrate the formation of crystals. These results can
shed new light on our understanding of the relationship between crystallization
and vitrification.

$\Leb_2(\Rd)$-based Sobolev spaces with the help of a vector differential
operator $\mathbf{P}$ which consists of finitely or countably many differential
operators $P_n$ which themselves are linear combinations of distributional

Here we ensure that the vector distributional adjoint operator
$\mathbf{P}^{\ast}$ of $\mathbf{P}$ is well-defined in the distributional
sense. We then provide sufficient conditions under which our generalized
Sobolev space will become a reproducing-kernel Hilbert space whose reproducing
kernel can be computed via the associated Green function $G$. As an application
of this theoretical framework we use $G$ to construct multivariate minimum-norm
interpolants $s_{f,X}$ to data sampled from a generalized Sobolev function $f$
on $X$. Among other examples we show the reproducing-kernel Hilbert space of
the Gaussian function is equivalent to a generalized Sobolev space.

transport of relevant nutrients, and therefore their feeding rate. We propose a
modeling approach to the problem of optimal feeding at zero Reynolds number. We
consider a simplified spherical swimmer deforming its shape tangentially in a
steady fashion (so-called squirmer). Assuming that the nutrient is a passive
scalar obeying an advection-diffusion equation, the optimal use of flow fields
by the swimmer for feeding is determined by maximizing the diffusive flux at
the organism surface for a fixed rate of energy dissipation in the fluid. The
results are obtained through the use of an adjoint-based numerical optimization
implemented by a Legendre polynomial spectral method. We show that, to within a
negligible amount, the optimal feeding mechanism consists in putting all the
energy expended by surface distortion into swimming - so-called treadmill
motion - which is also the solution maximizing the swimming efficiency.
Surprisingly, although the rate of feeding depends strongly on the value of the
P\'eclet number, the optimal feeding stroke is shown to be essentially
independent of it, which is confirmed by asymptotic analysis. Within the
context of steady actuation, optimal feeding is therefore found to be
equivalent to optimal swimming for all P\'eclet numbers.

Differently from previous approaches, we require the network to be
topologically homogeneous, so that the metric is derived from pure
event-counting. Emergence from events has an operational motivation in
requiring that every physical quantity---including space-time---be defined
through precise measurement procedures. Topological homogeneity is a
requirement for having space-time metric emergent from the pure topology of
causal connections, whereas physically homogeneity corresponds to the
universality of the physical law. We analyze in detail the case of 1+1
dimensions. If we consider the causal connections as an exchange of classical
information, we can establish coordinate systems via an Einsteinian protocol,
and this leads to a digital version of the Lorentz transformations. In a
computational analogy, the foliation construction can be regarded as the
synchronization with a global clock of the calls to independent subroutines
(corresponding to the causally independent events) in a parallel distributed
computation. Thus the Lorentz time-dilation emerges as an increased density of
leaves within a single tic-tac of a clock, whereas space-contraction results
from the corresponding decrease of density of events per leaf. The operational
procedure of building up the coordinate system introduces an in-principle
indistinguishability between neighboring events, resulting in a network that is
coarse-grained, the thickness of the event being a function of the observer's
clock.

numerical simulation"" (CNS), is proposed to accurately simulate the propagation
of micro-level inherent physical uncertainty of chaotic dynamic systems. The
chaotic Hamiltonian H\'{e}non-Heiles system for motion of stars orbiting in a
plane about the galactic center is used as an example to show its basic ideas
and validity. Based on Taylor expansion at rather high-order and MP (multiple
precision) data in very high accuracy, the CNS approach can provide reliable
trajectories of the chaotic system in a finite interval $t\in[0,T_c]$, together
with an explicit estimation of the critical time $T_c$. Besides, the residual
and round-off errors are verified and estimated carefully by means of different
time-step $\Delta t$, different precision of data, and different order $M$ of
Taylor expansion. In this way, the numerical noises of the CNS can be reduced
to a required level, i.e. the CNS is a rigorous algorithm. It is illustrated
that, for the considered problem, the truncation and round-off errors of the
CNS can be reduced even to the level of $10^{-1244}$ and $10^{-1000}$,
respectively, so that the micro-level inherent physical uncertainty of the
initial condition (in the level of $10^{-60}$) of the H\'{e}non-Heiles system
can be investigated accurately. It is found that, due to the sensitive
dependence on initial condition (SDIC) of chaos, the micro-level inherent
physical uncertainty of the position and velocity of a star transfers into the
macroscopic randomness of motion. Thus, chaos might be a bridge from the
micro-level inherent physical uncertainty to the macroscopic randomness in
nature. This might provide us a new explanation to the SDIC of chaos from the
physical viewpoint.

Fermi and astrometric relative velocities that are geometrically defined in
general relativity. Mainly, we state that kinematic and spectroscopic relative
velocities only depend on the 4-velocities of the observer and the test
particle, unlike Fermi and astrometric relative velocities, that also depend on
the acceleration of the observer and the corresponding relative position of the
test particle, but only at the event of observation and not around it, as it
would be deduced, in principle, from the definition of these velocities.
Finally, we propose an open problem in general relativity that consists on
finding intrinsic expressions for Fermi and astrometric relative velocities
avoiding terms that involve the evolution of the relative position of the test
particle. For this purpose, the proofs given in this paper can serve as
inspiration.

inhomogeneous control of qudit ensembles is possible based on a semi-analytic
protocol that synthesizes the target through a sequence of alternating rf and
microwave-driven SU(2) rotations in overlapping irreducible subspaces. Several
examples of robust control are studied, and the semi-analytic protocol is
compared to a brute force, full numerical search. For small inhomogeneities, <
1%, both approaches achieve average fidelities greater than 0.99, but the brute
force approach performs superiorly, reaching high fidelities in shorter times
and capable of handling inhomogeneities well beyond experimental uncertainty.
The full numerical search is also applied to tomographic addressing whereby two
different nonclassical states of the spin are produced in two halves of the

60'south-west offset regions. Owing to its lower background level, Suzaku has
better sensitivity to Fe K-alpha lines than other satellites. Using precise Fe
line measurements, we studied the temperature structure, possible bulk motions,
and iron abundance distributions in the intracluster medium (ICM). The observed
spectra were well-represented by a single-temperature model, and two- or three-
temperature model did not improve chi-square substantially. The temperature,
derived from K-alpha line ratios of H-like and He-like Fe, agree with those
derived from the single-temperature model. Because the line ratio is a steep
function of temperature, the consistency supports the accuracy of temperature
measurements conducted with Suzaku. Within the 34'region, the redshift derived
from the central energy of the He-like Fe line is consistent with that from
optical observations, within a calibration error of 18 eV or 818 km/s in the
line of sight. This value is smaller than the sound velocity of ICM, which is
1500 km/s. The central energy of Fe lines at the 44'offset region around the
NGC 4839 subcluster is also consistent with those within the 34'region. These
results on the temperature and velocity structure suggest that the core of the
cluster is in a relaxed state, and non-thermal electrons relevant to the radio
halo are accelerated by intracluster turbulence rather than large-scale shocks.
Fe abundance is almost constant at 0.4 solar within the 34'region, and
decreases with radius. This value is slightly lower than those of other

describe electronic properties of strongly correlated materials. Because of the
rapid growth of the Hilbert space, the size of the finite bath used to
represent the infinite lattice is severely limited. In view of the increasing
interest in the effect of multi-orbital and multi-site Coulomb correlations in
transition metal oxides, high-Tc cuprates, iron-based pnictides, organic
crystals, etc., it is appropriate to explore the range of temperatures and bath
sizes in which ED provides accurate results for various system properties. The
bath must be large enough to achieve a sufficiently dense level spacing, so
that useful spectral information can be derived, especially close to the
Fermi-level. For an adequate projection of the lattice Green's function onto a
finite bath, the choice of the temperature is crucial. The role of these two
key ingredients in ED DMFT is discussed for a wide variety of systems in order
to establish the domain of applicability of this approach. Three criteria are
used to illustrate the accuracy of the results: (i) the convergence of the
self-energy with bath size, (ii) quality of the discretization of the bath
Green's function, and (iii) comparisons with complementary results obtained via
CTQMC DMFT. The materials comprise a variety of three- and five-orbital
systems, as well as single-band Hubbard models for two-dimensional triangular,
square and honeycomb lattices, where non-local Coulomb correlations are
important. The main conclusion from these examples is that a larger number of
correlated orbitals or sites requires a smaller number of bath levels. Down to
temperatures of 5 to 10 meV (for typical band widths W=2 eV) two bath levels
per correlated impurity orbital or site are usually adequate.

HAS shows that, with increasing N coverage (and decreasing stripe widths), the

finite-sized N-containing patches reduces from 3.5% to 1.8% and that, beyond a
critical exposure, the lateral expansion of the patches increases again

compressive stress is partially relieved via another mechanism, which turns out
to be nucleation of Cu-vacancy trenches. In full agreement with the above and

such stress is effectively relieved when stripes of clean Cu(001) form along

extremely sharp red edge to the Si II 1260 Angstrom feature, which stems from
the fastest moving ejecta on the far side of the SN 1006 shell--material that
is just encountering the reverse shock. Comparing HST far-UV spectra obtained
with COS in 2010 and with STIS in 1999, we have measured the change in this

edge of the Si II feature has shifted blueward by 0.19 +/- 0.05 Angstroms,
which means that the material hitting the reverse shock in 2010 was moving
slower by 44 +/- 11 km/s than the material that was hitting it in 1999, a
change corresponding to - 4.2 +/- 1.0 km/s/yr. This is the first observational
confirmation of a long-predicted dynamic effect for a reverse shock: that the
shock will work its way inward through expanding supernova ejecta and encounter
ever slower material as it proceeds. We also find that the column density of
shocked Si II (material that has passed through the reverse shock) has
decreased by 7 +/- 2% over the ten-year period. The decrease could indicate
that in this direction the reverse shock has been ploughing through a dense
clump of Si,leading to pressure and density transients.

(TIR-FCCS) has recently (S. Yordanov et al., Optics Express 17, 21149 (2009))
been established as an experimental method to probe hydrodynamic flows near
surfaces, on length scales of tens of nanometers. Its main advantage is that
fluorescence only occurs for tracer particles close to the surface, thus
resulting in high sensitivity. However, the measured correlation functions only
provide rather indirect information about the flow parameters of interest, such
as the shear rate and the slip length. In the present paper, we show how to
combine detailed and fairly realistic theoretical modeling of the phenomena by
Brownian Dynamics simulations with accurate measurements of the correlation
functions, in order to establish a quantitative method to retrieve the flow
properties from the experiments. Firstly, Brownian Dynamics is used to sample
highly accurate correlation functions for a fixed set of model parameters.
Secondly, these parameters are varied systematically by means of an
importance-sampling Monte Carlo procedure in order to fit the experiments. This
provides the optimum parameter values together with their statistical error
bars. The approach is well suited for massively parallel computers, which
allows us to do the data analysis within moderate computing times. The method
is applied to flow near a hydrophilic surface, where the slip length is
observed to be smaller than 10nm, and, within the limitations of the
experiments and the model, indistinguishable from zero.

an old stellar population to heat the dust, underestimates the observations of
dust emission at infrared wavelengths by a factor of ~ 3. Supplementing this
basic model with a young stellar component of low star formation activity in
both the inner disk (SFR ~ 0.21 Msun/yr) and dust ring (SFR ~ 0.05 Msun/yr), we
are capable of solving the discrepancy in the dust energy budget of the
Sombrero galaxy at wavelengths shortwards of 100 \mum. To account for the
increased FIR/submm emission beyond 100 \mum, we propose a additional dust
component distributed in quiescent clumps. This model with a clumpy dust
structure predicts three-quarters of the total dust content (~ 2.8 x 10^7 Msun)

the assumption of a clumpy dust structure in the Sombrero galaxy is supported

$f_1(1285)\pi$ decay channel by the E852/BNL experiment, however, this state
still lacks confirmation. We present a first event selection of the
diffractively produced $(K\bar{K}\pi\pi)^{-}$ system showing clean $f_1(1285)$
and $f_1(1420)$ resonances at competing statistics. A partial-wave analysis
started on $f_1(1285)\pi$ and $f_1(1420)\pi$ decay channels will further
complete the search for spin-exotics in the 2008/09 COMPASS data.

task in investigating many biological processes. Typical examples are detecting
differences between an inferred network and the corresponding gold standard, or
evaluating changes in a dynamic network along time. Although fruitful insights
can be drawn by qualitative or feature-based methods, a distance must be used
whenever a quantitative assessment is required. Here we introduce the
Ipsen-Mikhailov metric for biological network comparison, based on the
difference of the distributions of the Laplacian eigenvalues of the compared
graphs. Being a spectral measure, its focus is on the general structure of the
net so it can overcome the issues affecting local metrics such as the edit
distances. Relation with the classical Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
is discussed, showing the finer discriminant resolution achieved by the
Ipsen-Mikhailov metric. We conclude with three examples of application in
functional genomic tasks, including stability of network reconstruction as
robustness to data subsampling, variability in dynamical networks and
differences in networks associated to a classification task.

two-level bosonic atoms are discussed using modern formulations of the
classical Sylvester's algorithm for the decomposition of homogeneous
polynomials in two variables. In particular, the symmetric rank and symmetric
border rank of spin squeezed states is calculated as well as their
Schr\""odinger-cat-like decomposition as the sum of macroscopically different
coherent spin states; Fock states provide an example of states for which the
symmetric rank and the symmetric border rank are different.

below for metric measure spaces (X,d,m) which is stable under measured
Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and rules out Finsler geometries. It can be given
in terms of an enforcement of the Lott, Sturm and Villani geodesic convexity
condition for the entropy coupled with the linearity of the heat flow. Besides
stability, it enjoys the same tensorization, global-to-local and
local-to-global properties. In these spaces, that we call RCD(K,\infty) spaces,
we prove that the heat flow (which can be equivalently characterized either as
the flow associated to the Dirichlet form, or as the Wasserstein gradient flow
of the entropy) satisfies Wasserstein contraction estimates and several
regularity properties, in particular Bakry-Emery estimates and the L^\infty-Lip
Feller regularization. We also prove that the distance induced by the Dirichlet
form coincides with d, that the local energy measure has density given by the
square of Cheeger's relaxed slope and, as a consequence, that the underlying
Brownian motion has continuous paths. All these results are obtained
independently of Poincar\'e and doubling assumptions on the metric measure
structure and therefore apply also to spaces which are not locally compact, as
the infinite-dimensional ones

correlations of valence neutrons to explain the behavior of charge radii in the

decrease of the charge radius between $^6$He and $^8$He is caused by a subtle
interplay between three effects: dineutron correlations, a spin-orbit
contribution to the charge radius, and a core swelling effect. We demonstrate
that two-neutron angular correlations in the $2^+_1$ resonance of $^6$He differ
markedly from the ground-state correlations in $^{6,8}$He.

component upgrades is a complex task, and the users need to have an expressive

interested in. Recent research has shown that it is possible to develop solvers
that handle preferences expressed as a combination of a few basic criteria used
in the MISC competition, ranging from the number of new components to the
freshness of the final configuration. In this work we introduce a set of new
criteria that allow the users to specify their preferences for solutions with
components aligned to the same upstream sources, provide an efficient encoding

of the normal-to-superconductive phase transition - detected first in a LTSC
tin, in 1989, and then confirmed in HTSC materials with much more higher
resolution (by a sensitive SFCO method) - and the other weakly expressed
effect, detected also both in LTSC & HTSC materials before their heat
capacity's known ""jump"". In a low-Tc superconductive tin this thermal effect is
detected a half century ago, by Corak, but passed unnoticed so far. We show in
this work that, externally similar these 2 fine effects really and truly have
the same physical roots. To prove this assumption theoretically, and to reveal
the reasons for their common origin, we use here a concept, which admits
existence of two types of the Cooper pairs in SC materials - ""singlet"" and
""triplet"". As we conclude in this paper, they show completely different,
non-traditional temperature behavior upon cooling of SC materials. We believe
that this study results (along with the ""triplet"" superconductivity, proven
experimentally in Josephson junctions quite recently, with the ferromagnetic
barrier) may obtain key importance for the true understanding of the real
nature of the superconductive phenomenon (in whole) and to uncover electron
""pairing"" mechanisms above the Meissner expel (in particular).

algorithm makes use of the reference signals to estimate the total frequency

non-Gaussian impulse noise interfering with pilot signals. Thus, the algorithm
maps trained data into a high dimensional feature space and uses the structural
risk minimization (SRM) principle to carry out the regression estimation for
the frequency response function of the highly selective channel. The
simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method which has good
performance and high precision to track the variations of the fading channels
compared to the conventional LS method and it is robust at high speed mobility.
