studied by focusing on the Gaussian cyclic Z-interference channel. To this end,
the symmetric feedback capacity of the linear shift deterministic cyclic
Z-interference channel (LD-CZIC) is completely characterized for all

the most powerful tools in the investigation of superconductors, where it
provides information on the order parameter (OP), a fundamental property of the
superconducting state. In the past 20 years, successive improvements of the

making it suited to study new superconductors with ""exotic"" properties such as

the OP to fine structural details present unprecedent challenges for this

understanding of these materials, despite some apparent inconsistencies that
can be overcome if a homogeneous treatment of the data is used. We also
demonstrate that, if properly extended theoretical models for Andreev
reflection are used, directional PCAR spectroscopy can provide detailed
information not only on the amplitude and symmetry of the OPs, but also on the
nature of the pairing boson, and even give some hints about the shape of the

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Palomar-Green survey that have well-measured
CIV emission-line and X-ray properties (including 164 objects with measured
Gamma). We find that RQ quasars with both strong CIV emission and small CIV
blueshifts can be classified as ""hard-spectrum"" sources that are (relatively)
strong in the X-ray as compared to the UV. On the other hand, RQ quasars with
both weak CIV emission and large CIV blueshifts are instead ""soft-spectrum""
sources that are (relatively) weak in the X-ray as compared to the UV. This
work helps to further bridge optical/soft X-ray ""Eigenvector 1"" relationships

contours: the rank-based contours and the cover-based contours.
  In this paper, we present three dynamic algorithms for maintaining the
half-space depth of points and contours: The first maintains the half-space
depth of a single point in a data set in $O(\log n)$ time per update
(insertion/deletion) and overall linear space. By maintaining such a data

maintaining the rank-based contours in $O(n\cdot\log n)$ time per update and

contours at data points while maintaining the same complexities. A corollary of
this discussion is a strong structural result of independent interest

sensitive to the connection between star formation and dark matter halos over
the entire cosmic star formation history. Here we develop a model that
associates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos. The
model is based on a parameterized relation between the dust-processed infrared
luminosity and (sub)halo mass. By adjusting 3 free parameters, we attempt to
simultaneously fit the 4 frequency bands of the Planck measurement of the CIB
anisotropy power spectrum. To fit the data, we find that the star-formation
efficiency must peak on a halo mass scale of ~ 5x10^12 solar mass and the
infrared luminosity per unit mass must increase rapidly with redshift. By
comparing our predictions with a well-calibrated phenomenological model for
shot noise, and with a direct observation of source counts, we show that the
mean duty cycle of the underlying infrared sources must be near unity,
indicating that the CIB is dominated by long-lived quiescent star formation,
rather than intermittent short ""star bursts"". Despite the improved flexibility
of our model, the best simultaneous fit to all four Planck channels remains
relatively poor. We discuss possible further extensions to alleviate the
remaining tension with the data. Our model presents a theoretical framework for

same redshift, and that the discrepant redshift of C IV in component A is a
consequence of the BAL absorption in the spectrum of this component. LBQS
0103-2753 is one of the most closely spaced binary QSOs known, and is one of
relatively few dual AGN showing confirmed broad emission lines from both
components. While statistical studies of binary QSOs suggest that simultaneous
fueling of both black holes during a merger may be relatively rare, LBQS
0103-2753 demonstrates that such fueling can occur at high luminosity at a late
stage in the merger at nuclear spacing of only a few kpc, without severe
obscuration of the nuclei.

coupling between the nucleotides and the electrodes and hence the current
signals, we employ a pair of single-walled close-ended (6,6) carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) as electrodes. We then investigate the electron transport properties of
nucleotides sandwiched between such electrodes by using first-principles
quantum transport theory. In particular we consider the extreme case where the
separation between the electrodes is the smallest possible that still allows
the DNA translocation. The benzene-like ring at the end cap of the CNT can
strongly couple with the nucleobases and therefore both reduce conformational
fluctuations and significantly improve the conductance. The optimal molecular
configurations, at which the nucleotides strongly couple to the CNTs, and which
yield the largest transmission, are first identified. Then the electronic
structures and the electron transport of these optimal configurations are
analyzed. The typical tunneling currents are of the order of 50 nA for voltages
up to 1 V. At higher bias, where resonant transport through the molecular
states is possible, the current is of the order of several $\mu$A. Below 1 V
the currents associated to the different nucleotides are consistently
distinguishable, with adenine having the largest current, guanine the
second-largest, cytosine the third and finally thymine the smallest. We further
calculate the transmission coefficient profiles as the nucleotides are dragged
along the DNA translocation path and investigate the effects of configurational
variations. Based on these results we propose a DNA sequencing protocol
combining three possible data analysis strategies.

$N$ arms, with rewards on all arms evolving at each time as Markov chains with
known parameters. A player seeks to activate $K \geq 1$ arms at each time in
order to maximize the expected total reward obtained over multiple plays. RMAB
is a challenging problem that is known to be PSPACE-hard in general. We
consider in this work the even harder non-Bayesian RMAB, in which the
parameters of the Markov chain are assumed to be unknown \emph{a priori}. We
develop an original approach to this problem that is applicable when the
corresponding Bayesian problem has the structure that, depending on the known
parameter values, the optimal solution is one of a prescribed finite set of
policies. In such settings, we propose to learn the optimal policy for the
non-Bayesian RMAB by employing a suitable meta-policy which treats each policy
from this finite set as an arm in a different non-Bayesian multi-armed bandit
problem for which a single-arm selection policy is optimal. We demonstrate this
approach by developing a novel sensing policy for opportunistic spectrum access
over unknown dynamic channels. We prove that our policy achieves
near-logarithmic regret (the difference in expected reward compared to a
model-aware genie), which leads to the same average reward that can be achieved
by the optimal policy under a known model. This is the first such result in the
literature for a non-Bayesian RMAB. For our proof, we also develop a novel
generalization of the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound.

approximately 2.6. From combined analysis of Chandra, Swift and XMM-Newton

10^{39} erg s^{-1} in the first observation to ~ 0.5 x 10^{39} ergs s^{-1} over

exhibiting a faster decline of the thermal component. We do not find evidence

presence of a thermal component at kT ~ 1 keV in conjunction with a non-thermal
high energy tail, is also consistent with spectral properties of other ULXs in

been recently formulated as a non-Bayesian restless multi-armed bandit problem.
In this problem, there are N arms (corresponding to channels) and one player
(corresponding to a secondary user). The state of each arm evolves as a
finite-state Markov chain with unknown parameters. At each time slot, the
player can select K < N arms to play and receives state-dependent rewards
(corresponding to the throughput obtained given the activity of primary users).
The objective is to maximize the expected total rewards (i.e., total
throughput) obtained over multiple plays. The performance of an algorithm for
such a multi-armed bandit problem is measured in terms of regret, defined as
the difference in expected reward compared to a model-aware genie who always
plays the best K arms. In this paper, we propose a new continuous exploration
and exploitation (CEE) algorithm for this problem. When no information is
available about the dynamics of the arms, CEE is the first algorithm to
guarantee near-logarithmic regret uniformly over time. When some bounds
corresponding to the stationary state distributions and the state-dependent
rewards are known, we show that CEE can be easily modified to achieve
logarithmic regret over time. In contrast, prior algorithms require additional
information concerning bounds on the second eigenvalues of the transition
matrices in order to guarantee logarithmic regret. Finally, we show through
numerical simulations that CEE is more efficient than prior algorithms.

increasing B, becoming quasi-linear in the quantum Hall regime, in accord with
the reported behavior of the transport gap. By adjusting the two free

H\beta, and sometimes [O III] broader than ~1000 km/s, in total comprising \sim
10-30% (most likely ~25%) of Type I quasars at 0.2 < z < 0.8. We find that
virial masses using the H\beta and Mg II lines systematically differ for ANLs
by an average of as much as 0.5 dex. Because the broad H\beta component width
increases in ANLs but Mg II does not, we might suspect H\beta-based virial
masses for ANLs are wrong but Mg II masses are correct. If this is due to an
outflow reaching the lower-ionization potential H\beta line, C IV masses will
be similarly flawed. However, we cannot be certain of this explanation without
followup work, and may be unable to identify which quasars are ANLs at z > 0.8.
Therefore, it is essential that ANLs be well-understood and well-modeled in
order to allow the use of virial mass estimators on large optical spectroscopic
catalogs, particularly at z < 0.4 and z > 2.0 where only one broad line is
available for use in mass estimation.

first 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the formation and evolution of
Betelgeuse's bow shock. The models include realistic low temperature cooling
and cover a range of plausible interstellar medium densities and stellar
velocities between 0.3 - 1.9 cm-3 and 28 - 73 km/s. We show that the flow
dynamics and morphology of the bow shock differ substantially due to the
preferential growth of Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the
models. The former dominate the models with slow stellar velocities resulting
in a clumpy bow shock sub-structure, whereas the latter produce a smoother,
more layered sub-structure in the fast models. If the mass in the bow shock
shell is low, as seems to be implied by the AKARI luminosities (~0.003 Msun),
then Betelgeuse's bow shock is very young and is unlikely to have reached a
steady state. The circular nature of the bow shock shell is consistent with
this conclusion. Thus, our results suggest that Betelgeuse entered the red

Lya emission may be detectable up to z~8.5, i.e. well into the reionization

of their unusual colours. We quantify this effect in some of the filters used

galaxies with high Lya fluxes may exhibit much bluer J-H colours at z=8-10 than
any normal type of galaxy at these redshifts. This colour signature can arise
even if pop III stars account for as little as ~1e-3 to ~1e-2 of the stellar

and high spatial resolution (256 grid points per scale height) are chosen to
mitigate the effects of wave nonlinearity. To complement the existing numerical
studies, we focus on the primary physical variables such as the spatial profile

instead of secondary quantities such as the planetary migration rate. Our

the theory. We find that the use of a too large time-step without properly
resolving the dynamical time scale around the planet produces incorrect
results, and may lead to spurious gap opening. Global simulations of planet
migration and gap opening violating this requirement may be affected by

influence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution is becoming more
evident, their large scale environments may help us understand the evolutionary
processes leading to activity. The effect of activity can be seen particularly
by showing if different types of active galaxies are formed by similar
mechanisms. Our aim is to study the supercluster-scale environments of active
galaxies up to redshift 0.4. Our data includes quasars, BL Lac objects, Seyfert
and radio galaxies. We use a three-dimensional low-resolution
luminosity-density field constructed of a sample of luminous red galaxies in
the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculate the
average density of this field in a volume of a 3\,$h^{-1}$Mpc sphere around
each AGN for estimating the environmental density levels of different types of
AGN. This analysis gives us the distribution of AGN in the global environment
of superclusters, filaments, and voids. Our results show that while radio-quiet
quasars and Seyfert galaxies are mostly located in low-density regions, radio
galaxies have higher environmental densities. BL Lac objects usually have
low-density environments, but some of them are also in very high density
regions. Our results give support to the theory of galaxy evolution where
galaxies are affected by two modes of AGN feedback: quasar mode that turns a
blue star-forming galaxy into a red and dead one, and radio mode that regulates
the growth of massive elliptical galaxies. We conclude that quasars are in
lower density environments than radio galaxies most likely because the galaxies
in rich environments have evolved to a state suitable for radio-loud activity
earlier. Galaxies in poor environment have evolved slower, and are still going
through the earlier quasar mode feedback in galaxy evolution.

quite bright with line-to-FIR continuum luminosity ratios that are
~7.0\times10^{-4} (Cloverleaf) and 2.1\times10^{-3} (SMMJ02399). With ratios
2-10 times larger than the average value for nearby galaxies, neither source
exhibits the line-to-continuum deficits seen in nearby sources. The line
strengths also indicate large ionized gas fractions, ~8 to 17% of the molecular
gas mass. The [OIII]/[NII] line ratio is very sensitive to the effective
temperature of ionizing stars and the ionization parameter for emission arising
in the narrow-line region (NLR) of an AGN. Using our previous detection of the
[OIII] 88 {\mu}m line, the [OIII]/[NII] line ratio for SMMJ02399-0136 indicates
the dominant source of the line emission is either stellar HII regions ionized
by O9.5 stars, or the NLR of the AGN with ionization parameter log(U) = -3.3 to
-4.0. A composite system, where 30 to 50% of the FIR lines arise in the NLR

onboard the XMM-Newton satellite we are able to take detailed spectra of the
remnant. In addition, we use the MOS data to obtain spectral information at
higher energies. Results: The spectrum shows signs of recombination and we
derive the conditions for which the remnant and SNR in general are able to cool
rapidly enough to become over-ionised. The elemental abundances found are
mostly in agreement with the mean LMC abundances. Our models and calculations
favour the lower age estimate mentioned in the literature of $\sim4000$ year.

identified from a 9.3-day periodic transit signal in the Kepler photometry.
From high-resolution spectroscopy of the star, we find a stellar effective
temperature Teff=5541 \pm 60 K, a metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.13 \pm 0.06, and a
surface gravity log(g)=4.59 \pm 0.10. We combine the estimate of Teff and
[Fe/H] with an estimate of the stellar density derived from the photometric
light curve to deduce a stellar mass of M_star = 0.936 \pm 0.040 M_Sun and a
stellar radius of R_star = 0.850 \pm 0.018 R_Sun. We rule out the possibility
that the transits result from an astrophysical false positive by first
identifying the subset of stellar blends that reproduce the precise shape of
the light curve. We conclude that the planetary scenario is more than three
orders of magnitude more likely than a blend. The blend scenario is
independently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: we measure a
transit depth with Spitzer at 4.5 {\mu}m of 547+113-110 ppm, consistent with
the depth measured in the Kepler optical bandpass of 567\pm6 ppm. We determine
a physical radius of the planet Kepler-19b of R_p = 2.209 \pm 0.048 R_Earth.
From radial-velocity observations of the star, we find an upper limit on the
planet mass of 20.3 M_Earth, corresponding to a maximum density of 10.4 g
cm^-3. We report a significant sinusoidal deviation of the transit times from a
predicted linear ephemeris, which we conclude is due to an additional
perturbing body in the system. We cannot uniquely determine the orbital
parameters of the perturber, as various dynamical mechanisms match the
amplitude, period, and shape of the transit timing signal and satisfy the host
star's radial velocity limits. However, the perturber in these mechanisms has
period <160 days and mass <6 M_Jup, confirming its planetary nature as
Kepler-19c. [Abridged]

characteristic masses of stars in terms of fundamental constants; the almost
complete invariance of this mass as a function of the star-forming environment
suggests that this should be possible. Here I provide such a calculation. The
typical stellar mass is set by the characteristic fragment mass in a
star-forming cloud, which depends on the cloud's density and temperature
structure. Except in the very early universe, the latter is determined mainly
by the radiation released as matter falls onto seed protostars. The energy
yield from this process is ultimately set by the properties of deuterium
burning in protostellar cores, which determines the stars' radii. I show that
it is possible to combine these considerations to compute a characteristic
stellar mass almost entirely in terms of fundamental constants, with an
extremely weak residual dependence on the interstellar pressure and
metallicity. This result not only explains the invariance of stellar masses, it
resolves a second mystery: why fragmentation of a cold, low-density
interstellar cloud, a process with no obvious dependence on the properties of
nuclear reactions, happens to select a stellar mass scale such that stellar
cores can ignite hydrogen. Finally, the weak residual dependence on the
interstellar pressure and metallicity may explain recent observational hints of
a smaller characteristic mass in the high pressure, high metallicity cores of
giant elliptical galaxies.

most minihalos were photoevaporated by ionizing photons from star-forming
galaxies, these galaxies also drove large outflows, which in some cases would
have reached the minihalos in advance of ionization fronts. In the previous
papers in this series, we carried out high-resolution, three-dimensional

found that, for a fiducial set of parameters, minihalos were transformed into
dense, chemically homogenous stellar clusters. Here we conduct a suite of
simulations that follow these interactions over a wide range of parameters
including minihalo mass, minihalo formation redshift, outflow energy, outflow
redshift, distance, concentration, and spin. In almost all cases, the shocked
minihalos form molecules through nonequillibrium reactions and then cool
rapidly to become compact, chemically-homogenous stellar clusters. Furthermore,
we show that the unique properties of these clusters make them a prime target
for direct study with the next generation of telescopes, and that there are
many reasons to suspect that their low-redshift counterparts are the observed

why the observation of electron-electron renormalization effects has been so
elusive in the recent experiments. We argue that the strength of Coulomb
interactions in graphene may be characterized by an effective fine structure
constant given by
$\alpha^{\star}(\mathbf{k},\omega)\equiv2.2/\epsilon(\mathbf{k},\omega)$, where
$\epsilon(\mathbf{k},\omega)$ is the dynamical dielectric function. At long
wavelengths, $\alpha^{\star}(\mathbf{k},\omega)$ appears to have its smallest
value in the static regime, where $\alpha^{\star}(\mathbf{k}\to0,0)\approx1/7$

strength of Coulomb interactions in graphene is not universal, but depends
highly on the scale of the phenomenon of interest. We propose a prescription in

programming environment for processing large datasets. We focus on the
practical and popular clustering problems, $k$-center and $k$-median. We
develop fast clustering algorithms with constant factor approximation
guarantees. From a theoretical perspective, we give the first analysis that
shows several clustering algorithms are in $\mathcal{MRC}^0$, a theoretical
MapReduce class introduced by Karloff et al. \cite{KarloffSV10}. Our algorithms
use sampling to decrease the data size and they run a time consuming clustering
algorithm such as local search or Lloyd's algorithm on the resulting data set.
Our algorithms have sufficient flexibility to be used in practice since they
run in a constant number of MapReduce rounds. We complement these results by
performing experiments using our algorithms. We compare the empirical
performance of our algorithms to several sequential and parallel algorithms for
the $k$-median problem. The experiments show that our algorithms' solutions are
similar to or better than the other algorithms' solutions. Furthermore, on data
sets that are sufficiently large, our algorithms are faster than the other
parallel algorithms that we tested.

thermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (WD) in a binary system; however,
little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physical

imaging obtained at the location of SN 2011fe/PTF11kly, the closest SN Ia
discovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-light
luminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits on

vast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the exploding

3.5 times the mass of the Sun. These observations favour a scenario where the

affects gravity, in the sense that a test particle near a massive object in a

that opposes the local attraction to the massive object. This effect
distinguishes different comoving 3-manifolds, potentially providing a
theoretical justification for the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space observational
hypothesis and a dynamical test for cosmic topology. It is necessary to check
if this effect occurs in a fully relativistic solution of the Einstein
equations that has a multiply connected spatial section. A Schwarzschild-like
exact solution that is multiply connected in one spatial direction is checked
for analytical and numerical consistency with the heuristic result. The T$^1$
(slab space) heuristic result is found to be relativistically correct. For a
fundamental domain size of $L$, a slow-moving, negligible-mass test particle
lying at distance $x$ along the axis from the object of mass $M$ to its nearest
multiple image, where $GM/c^2 \ll x \ll L/2$, has a residual acceleration away
from the massive object of $4\zeta(3) G(M/L^3)\,x$, where $\zeta(3)$ is
Ap\'ery's constant. For $M \sim 10^14 M_\odot$ and $L \sim 10$ to $20\hGpc$,
this linear expression is accurate to $\pm10%$ over $3\hMpc \ltapprox x
\ltapprox 2\hGpc$. Thus, at least in a simple example of a multiply connected

Newtonian-like reasoning, and its linear derivation is accurate over about
three orders of magnitude in $x$.

demonstrate that optical activity is not a privilege of the electronic charge
excitations but it can also emerge for the spin excitations in magnetic matter.
The square-lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$ offers an ideal arena to
test this idea, since it can be transformed to a chiral form by application of
external magnetic fields. As a direct proof of the field-induced chiral state,
we observed large optical activity when the light is in resonance with spin
excitations at sub-terahertz frequencies. In addition, we found that the
magnetochiral effect, the absorption difference for the light beams propagating
parallel and anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field, has an exceptionally
large amplitude close to 100%. All these features are ascribed to the

flattened disks rotate faster than the equivalent spherical mass distribution
(as spelled out for this application in McGaugh 2011b). They further argue that
the the intrinsic scatter in the BTFR is merely tiny rather than zero. This
difference is within the uncertainty of the uncertainties, so confirms rather
than refutes my result. Worse, these papers miss the basic point. Why does MOND
have any predictions come true? Why does it provide such an effective and
economical description of galaxy dynamics? They do nothing to address these
deeper questions. One can imagine that the apparently MONDian behavior of
galaxies is merely an approximation to some phenomenology that emerges in the
context of LCDM, but we have yet to demonstrate how this occurs. Until we
confront this issue seriously, and confirm the existence of non-baryonic cold
dark matter in the laboratory, it is reasonable to remain skeptical of LCDM as
well as of MOND.

analytically tractable way to characterize the information-theoretic capacity

channel is studied under the assumption that the transmitters can cooperate via
coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission. In [1], the authors considered the
linear asymmetric model of Wyner, where each transmitter is connected to its
own receiver and its successor, and is aware of its own message as well as M-1
preceding messages. The per user DoF was shown to go to M/(M+1) as the number
of users increases to infinity. In this work, the same model of channel
connectivity is considered, with a relaxed cooperation constraint that bounds
the maximum number of transmitters at which each message can be available, by a
cooperation order M. We show that the relaxation of the cooperation constraint,
while maintaining the same load imposed on a backhaul link needed to distribute
the messages, results in a gain in the DoF. In particular, the asymptotic limit
of the per user DoF under the cooperation order constraint is (2M)/(2M+1) .
Moreover, the optimal transmit set selection satisfies a local cooperation
constraint. i.e., each message needs only to be available at neighboring
transmitters. [1] A. Lapidoth, S. Shamai (Shitz) and M. A. Wigger, ""A linear

is that similarities between objects can be measured in many different metrics.
For instance similarity between two papers can be based on common authors,
where they are published, keyword similarity, citations, etc. As such, graphs
with multiple edges is a more accurate model to describe similarities between
objects. Each edge/metric provides only partial information about the data;
recovering full information requires aggregation of all the similarity metrics.
Clustering becomes much more challenging in this context, since in addition to
the difficulties of the traditional clustering problem, we have to deal with a
space of clusterings. We generalize the concept of clustering in single-edge
graphs to multi-edged graphs and investigate problems such as: Can we find a
clustering that remains good, even if we change the relative weights of
metrics? How can we describe the space of clusterings efficiently? Can we find
unexpected clusterings (a good clustering that is distant from all given
clusterings)? If given the ground-truth clustering, can we recover how the
weights for edge types were aggregated? %In this paper, we discuss these
problems and the underlying algorithmic challenges and propose some solutions.

the spatial distribution and line ratios expected from a McKee-Ostriker (MO)

to directly probe the cosmic growth history of density perturbations. A
distribution function approach where RSD can be written as a sum over density
weighted velocity moment correlators has recently been developed. We use Nbody
simulations to investigate the individual contributions and convergence of this
expansion for dark matter. If the series is expanded as a function of powers of
mu, cosine of the angle between the Fourier mode and line of sight, there are a
finite number of terms contributing at each order. We present these terms and
investigate their contribution to the total as a function of wavevector k. For
mu^2 the correlation between density and momentum dominates on large scales.
Higher order corrections, which act as a Finger-of-God (FoG) term, contribute
1% at k~0.015h/Mpc, 10% at k~0.05h/Mpc at z=0, while for k>0.15h/Mpc they
dominate and make the total negative. These higher order terms are dominated by
density-energy density correlations which contribute negatively to the power,
while the contribution from vorticity part of momentum density auto-correlation
is an order of magnitude lower. For mu^4 term the dominant term on large scales
is the scalar part of momentum density auto-correlation, while higher order
terms dominate for k>0.15h/Mpc. For mu^6 and mu^8 we find it has very little
power for k<0.15h/Mpc. We also compare the expansion to the full 2D P^ss(k,mu)
as well as to their multipoles. For these statistics an infinite number of
terms contribute and we find that the expansion achieves percent level accuracy
for kmu<0.15h/Mpc at 6th order, but breaks down on smaller scales because the
series is no longer perturbative. We explore resummation of the terms into FoG
kernels, which extend the convergence up to a factor of 2 in scale. We find
that the FoG kernels are approximately Lorentzian.

RJ is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 RJ.
Orbiting its slightly evolved G0 host with a 4.438-day period, this
0.431\pm0.041 MJ planet is the least-irradiated within this
largest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetary
physics. The planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low density
of 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. We detect the occultation of the planet at a
significance of 3.7{\sigma} in the Kepler bandpass. This yields a geometric
albedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scattered
light and emitted thermal flux. We use multiple observations with Warm Spitzer
to detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m
bandpasses, respectively. The occultation photometry timing is consistent with
a circular orbit, at e < 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e < 0.09 (3{\sigma}). The
occultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model with
no dayside temperature inversion. The Kepler occultation detection provides
significant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure are
preliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths in
hot Jupiter atmospheres. If Kepler-12b and HD 209458b, which intercept similar
incident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interior
energy source needed to explain the large radius of Kepler-12b is three times
larger than that of HD 209458b. This may suggest that more than one
radius-inflation mechanism is at work for Kepler-12b, or that it is less
heavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

determine the structure of the Green's function of $H_{\alpha}$.
  Developing Weyl-Titchmarsh theory requires control over certain

consider existence and uniqueness of solutions of 2nd-order differential

to understand public opinion towards real world events. In this paper, we
investigate over 1.5 million Twitter messages (tweets) for the period 9th March
2011 to 31st May 2011 in order to track awareness and anxiety levels in the
Tokyo metropolitan district to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and subsequent
tsunami and nuclear emergencies. These three events were tracked using both
English and Japanese tweets. Preliminary results indicated: 1) close
correspondence between Twitter data and earthquake events, 2) strong
correlation between English and Japanese tweets on the same events, 3) tweets
in the native language play an important roles in early warning, 4) tweets
showed how quickly Japanese people's anxiety returned to normal levels after
the earthquake event. Several distinctions between English and Japanese tweets
on earthquake events are also discussed. The results suggest that Twitter data
can be used as a useful resource for tracking the public mood of populations
affected by natural disasters as well as an early warning system.

the planet's internal density structure and this information is not identical
to that contained in the gravitational moments. The forthcoming Juno mission to
Jupiter might determine Jupiter's normalized moment of inertia NMoI=C/MR^2 by
measuring Jupiter's pole precession and the Lense-Thirring acceleration of the
spacecraft (C is the axial moment of inertia, and M and R are Jupiter's mass
and mean radius, respectively). We investigate the possible range of NMoI
values for Jupiter based on its measured gravitational field using a simple
core/envelope model of the planet assuming that J_2 and J_4 are perfectly known
and are equal to their measured values. The model suggests that for fixed
values of J_2 and J_4 a range of NMOI values between 0.2629 and 0.2645 can be
found. The Radau-Darwin relation gives a NMoI value that is larger than the
model values by less than 1%. A low NMoI of ~ 0.236, inferred from a dynamical
model (Ward & Canup, 2006, ApJ, 640, L91) is inconsistent with this range, but
the range is model dependent. Although we conclude that the NMoI is tightly
constrained by the gravity coefficients, a measurement of Jupiter's NMoI to a
few tenths of percent by Juno could provide an important constraint on
Jupiter's internal structure. We carry out a simplified assessment of the error
involved in Juno's possible determination of Jupiter's NMoI.

display both high dimensional propulsion velocities (up to ~ 21 micrometer per

with natural microorganisms and other artificial propellers. Their propulsion
characteristics are studied theoretically using an elastohydrodynamic model
which takes into account the elasticity of the nanowire and its hydrodynamic
interaction with the fluid medium. The critical role of flexibility in this
mode of propulsion is illustrated by simple physical arguments, and is
quantitatively investigated with the help of an asymptotic analysis for
small-amplitude swimming. The theoretical predictions are then compared with
experimental measurements and we obtain good agreement. Finally, we demonstrate
the operation of these nanomotors in a real biological environment (human
serum), emphasizing the robustness of their propulsion performance and their

variables outstrips the number n of samples available to construct the

formalism called masked covariance estimation, where each entry of the sample
covariance estimator is reweighted to reflect an a priori assessment of its
importance. This paper provides a short analysis of the masked sample
covariance estimator by means of a matrix concentration inequality. The main
result applies to general distributions with at least four moments. Specialized
to the case of a Gaussian distribution, the theory offers qualitative
improvements over earlier work. For example, the new results show that n = O(B

B up to a relative spectral-norm error, in contrast to the sample complexity n
= O(B log^5 p) obtained by Levina and Vershynin.

magnetic susceptibility. The protocol followed in doing so has been outlined in
some recent work. Various plots of entan- glement comparing the experimental
extraction with theoretical estimates are given. Quantitative comparison
between concurrence and entanglement witness is given for both the theoretical

temperature and field. The spin system studied is a chain, which exhibits
dimerisation and yields fascinating entanglement properties when the
temperature and magnetic field is varied. These spin systems exhibit quantum
phase transition (QPT) at low temperatures, when the magnetic field is swept
through a critical value. We show explicitly for the first time, using tools
used in quantum information processing (QIP), that quantum phase transition
(QPT) can be captured experimentally using canonically conjugate observables.
Macroscopically, quantum complementarity relation clearly delineates entangled
states from separable states across the QPT. We have estimated the partial
information sharing in this system from our magnetization and susceptibility

presented and discussed in physical terms. They go beyond the usual Dirac phase
factors and they exhibit nonlocal quantal behavior, with the well-known
Relativistic Causality of classical fields affecting directly the phases of
wavefunctions in the Schr\""odinger Picture. These nonlocal phase behaviors,
apparently overlooked in path-integral approaches, give a natural account of
the dynamical nonlocality character of the various (even static) Aharonov-Bohm
phenomena, while at the same time they seem to respect Causality. For particles
passing through nonvanishing magnetic or electric fields they lead to
cancellations of Aharonov-Bohm phases at the observation point, generalizing
earlier semiclassical experimental observations (of Werner & Brill) to
delocalized (spread-out) quantum states. This leads to a correction of
previously unnoticed sign-errors in the literature, and to a natural
explanation of the deeper reason why certain time-dependent semiclassical
arguments are consistent with static results in purely quantal Aharonov-Bohm
configurations. These nonlocalities also provide a remedy for misleading
results propagating in the literature (concerning an uncritical use of Dirac
phase factors, that persists since the time of Feynman's work on path
integrals). They are shown to conspire in such a way as to exactly cancel the
instantaneous Aharonov-Bohm phase and recover Relativistic Causality in earlier
"" paradoxes"" (such as the van Kampen thought-experiment), and to also complete
Peshkin's discussion of the electric Aharonov-Bohm effect in a causal manner.
The present formulation offers a direct way to address time-dependent single-
vs double-slit experiments and the associated causal issues -- issues that have
recently attracted attention, with respect to the inability of current theories
to address them.

data sample in the redshift range of $0.1<z<2.0$, we get the improved
constraints and more sufficient comparison. We show that OHD is not only able
to play almost the same role in constraining cosmological parameters as SNe Ia
does but also provides the effective measurement of the deviation of the DE
models from standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In the holographic and agegraphic
scenarios, the results indicate that the FEH is more preferable than HH
scenario. However, both two time scenarios show better approximations to
$\Lambda$CDM model than the length scenarios.

has also practical safety applications by providing improved crowd situational

clustering in order to uncover globally, which users participate in a given

Au-Ge flux (AGF) as well as in Sn flux (SF). X-ray powder-diffraction and EDX
measurements indicate that in the latter case Sn atoms from the flux are
incorporated in the samples, leading to a decrease of the lattice constants by
~ 0.3% compared to AGF samples. For both types of samples, a strong anisotropy
of the magnetization M for the magnetic field B parallel and perpendicular to
the c direction is observed with M||/M^{\bot} ~ 6 - 7 in low fields just above
10 K. This anisotropy is preserved to high fields and temperatures and can be
quantitatively explained by crystal electric field effects. Antiferromagnetic
ordering sets in around 10 K as previously found for polycrystalline samples.
From the magnetization data of our single crystals we obtain the phase diagrams
for the AGF and SF samples. The magnetic properties depend strongly on the flux
employed. While the AGF samples exhibit a complex behavior indicative of
several magnetic transitions, the SF samples adopt a simpler antiferromagnetic
structure with a single spin-flop transition. This effect of a more ordered
state induced by disorder in form of Sn impurities is qualitatively explained
within the ANNNI model, which assumes ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
interactions in agreement with the magnetic structure previously inferred from
neutron-scattering experiments on polycrystalline CeAu2Ge2 by Loidl et al.

argon-hydrogen plasma produced in a reactive ion etching (RIE) system.
Electronic transport measurements in combination with Raman spectroscopy are
used to link the electric mean free path to the optically extracted defect
concentration. We emphasize the role of the self-bias of the graphene in
suppressing the erosion of the akes during plasma processing. We show that
under the chosen plasma conditions the process does not introduce considerable
damage to the graphene sheet and that hydrogenation occurs primarily due to the
hydrogen ions from the plasma and not due to fragmentation of water adsorbates
on the graphene surface by highly accelerated plasma electrons. For this reason
the hydrogenation level can be precisely controlled. The hydrogenation process
presented here can be easily implemented in any RIE plasma system.

Using these noncommutative deformed canonical commutation relations, a model
describing the dynamics of the noncommutative complex scalar field is proposed.
The noncommutative field equations are solved, and the vacuum energy is
calculated to the second order in the parameter of noncommutativity. As an
application to this model, the Casimir effect, due to the zero point
fluctuations of the noncommutative complex scalar field, is considered. It
turns out that in spite of its smallness, the noncommutativity gives rise to a
repulsive force at the microscopic level, leading to a modifed Casimr potential
with a minimum at the point amin= racine(5/84){\pi}{\theta}.

found elsewhere working in the Batyrev-Borisov framework. When G is an
invertible nondegenerate quasihomogeneous polynomial, the Chiodo-Ruan

associate a particular complex structure for \mathcal{M}_G with a particular
Kaehler structure for the mirror \widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_G. We make this
association for such G when the ambient space of \mathcal{M}_G is CP^2, CP^3,

motion for the fluid potentials and the energy-momentum tensor in the first
order in the noncommutative parameter. The density current does not receive any
noncommutative corrections and it is conserved under the action of the
commutative generators $P_{\mu}$ but the energy-momentum tensor is not.
Therefore, we determine the set of constraints under which the energy-momentum
tensor is divergenceless. Another set of constraints on the fluid potentials is
obtained from the requirement of the invariance of the action under the
generalization of the volume preserving transformations of the noncommutative
spacetime. We show that the proposed action describes noncommutative fluid
models by casting the energy-momentum tensor in the familiar fluid form and
identifying the corresponding energy and momentum densities. In the commutative
limit, they are identical to the corresponding quantities of the relativistic
perfect fluids. The energy-momentum tensor contains a dissipative term that is
due to the noncommutative spacetime and vanishes in the commutative limit.
Finally, we particularize the theory to the case when the complex fluid
potentials are characterized by a function $K(z,\bar{z})$ that is a deformation
of the complex plane and show that this model has important common features
with the commutative fluid such as infinitely many conserved currents and a
conserved axial current that in the commutative case is associated to the
topologically conserved linking number.

to be closely related to the expansion properties of the corresponding

  In the sequential case, where the processor has a fast memory of size $M$,
too small to store three $n$-by-$n$ matrices, the lower bound on the number of
words moved between fast and slow memory is, for many of the matrix
multiplication algorithms, $\Omega((\frac{n}{\sqrt M})^{\omega_0}\cdot M)$,

With $p$ parallel processors, each with fast memory of size $M$, the lower
bound is $p$ times smaller.
  These bounds are attainable both for sequential and for parallel algorithms
and hence optimal. These bounds can also be attained by many fast algorithms in
linear algebra (e.g., algorithms for LU, QR, and solving the Sylvester

$n$ rays emanating from the origin such that two neighboring rays are separated
by an angle of $2\pi/n$. The center of the disks have to lie on the rays, and
no two disk centers are allowed to lie on the same ray. We require that the
disks have disjoint interiors, and that for every ray the segment between the
origin and the boundary of its associated disk avoids the interior of the
disks. Let $\r$ be the sum of the disk radii. We introduce a greedy strategy
that constructs such a disk arrangement that can be covered with a disk
centered at the origin whose radius is at most $2\r$, which is best possible.
The greedy strategy needs O(n) arithmetic operations.
  As an application of our result we present an algorithm for embedding
unordered trees with straight lines and perfect angular resolution such that it
can be covered with a disk of radius $n^{3.0367}$, while having no edge of
length smaller than 1. The tree drawing algorithm is an enhancement of a recent
result by Duncan et al. [Symp. of Graph Drawing, 2010] that exploits the
heavy-edge tree decomposition technique to construct a drawing of the tree that
can be covered with a disk of radius $2 n^4$.

  Interconnection System of Non-Hamiltonian Base Graphs",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hamiltonicity is an important property in parallel and distributed
computation. Existence of Hamiltonian cycle allows efficient emulation of
distributed algorithms on a network wherever such algorithm exists for
linear-array and ring, and can ensure deadlock freedom in some routing
algorithms in hierarchical interconnection networks. Hamiltonicity can also be
used for construction of independent spanning tree and leads to designing fault
tolerant protocols. Optical Transpose Interconnection Systems or OTIS (also
referred to as two-level swapped network) is a widely studied interconnection
network topology which is popular due to high degree of scalability,
regularity, modularity and package ability. Surprisingly, to our knowledge,
only one strong result is known regarding Hamiltonicity of OTIS - showing that
OTIS graph built of Hamiltonian base graphs are Hamiltonian. In this work we
consider Hamiltonicity of OTIS networks, built on Non-Hamiltonian base and
answer some important questions. First, we prove that Hamiltonicity of base
graph is not a necessary condition for the OTIS to be Hamiltonian. We present
an infinite family of Hamiltonian OTIS graphs composed on Non-Hamiltonian base
graphs. We further show that, it is not sufficient for the base graph to have
Hamiltonian path for the OTIS constructed on it to be Hamiltonian. We give
constructive proof of Hamiltonicity for a large family of Butterfly-OTIS. This
proof leads to an alternate efficient algorithm for independent spanning trees
construction on this class of OTIS graphs. Our algorithm is linear in the
number of vertices as opposed to the generalized algorithm, which is linear in
the number of edges of the graph.

ordered state in the underdoped regime. We identify two distinct
disorder-induced magnetic phases of this type depending on the strength of the
scatterers. For weak potential scatterers used to model dopant disorder, charge
reorganization may push local regions in-between the impurities across the
magnetic phase boundary, whereas for strong scatterers used to model
substitutional ions, a local static magnetic moment is formed around each
impurity. We calculate the density of states and find a remarkably universal
low-energy behavior largely independent of both disorder and magnetization.
However, the magnetic regions are characterized by larger (reduced)
superconducting gap (coherence peaks) and a sub-gap kink in the density of

methods for estimating the partition function and marginal probabilities in
graphical models, respectively. The computational complexity of the Bethe
approximation is decided by the number of operations required to solve a set of
non-linear equations, the so-called Bethe equation. Although the BP algorithm
was inspired and developed independently, Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2004)
showed that the BP algorithm solves the Bethe equation if it converges
(however, it often does not). This naturally motivates the following question
to understand limitations and empirical successes of the Bethe and BP methods:
is the Bethe equation computationally easy to solve? We present a
message-passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in a polynomial number of
operations for general binary graphical models of n variables where the maximum
degree in the underlying graph is O(log n). Our algorithm can be used as an
alternative to BP fixing its convergence issue and is the first fully
polynomial-time approximation scheme for the BP fixed-point computation in such

keep $f(R)$ gravity consistent with CMB observations ensures the energy flow
from dark energy to dark matter in the corresponding interacting model, which

developed for the purpose of studying magnetically-confined fusion plasmas on
energy confinement timescales. This code is used to evolve the combined system
of electron and ion fluid equations and Maxwell equations in toroidal
configurations with axisymmetric equilibria. Uniquely, the equilibrium is
co-evolved with the turbulence, and is thus modified by it. CENTORI is
applicable to tokamaks of arbitrary aspect ratio and high plasma beta. A
predictor-corrector, semi-implicit finite difference scheme is used to compute
the time evolution of fluid quantities and fields. Vector operations and the
evaluation of flux surface averages are speeded up by choosing the Jacobian of
the transformation from laboratory to plasma coordinates to be a function of
the equilibrium poloidal magnetic flux. A subroutine, GRASS, is used to
co-evolve the plasma equilibrium by computing the steady-state solutions of a
diffusion equation with a pseudo-time derivative. The code is written in
Fortran 95 and is efficiently parallelized using Message Passing Interface
(MPI). Illustrative examples of output from simulations of a tearing mode in a
large aspect ratio tokamak plasma and of turbulence in an elongated
conventional aspect ratio tokamak plasma are provided.

sources. They are mostly associated to active galactic nuclei (AGN) and (at
soft gamma rays) to gamma-ray bursts (GRB), but not only. Active galactic
nuclei consist of accreting supermassive black holes hosted by a galaxy that
present in some cases powerful relativistic jet activity. These sources, which
have been studied in gamma rays for several decades, are probably the most
energetic astrophysical objects, and their appearance depends much on whether
their jets point to us. Gamma-ray bursts, thought to be associated to
collapsing or merging stellar-mass objects at cosmological distances, are also
accreting highly relativistic jet sources that shine strongly at high energies.
These are very short-duration events, but they are also the most luminous.
Recently, star formation galaxies have turned out to be also gamma-ray
emitters. On the other hand, clusters of galaxies have not been detected beyond
X-rays yet. These are the largest known structures in the Universe; in their
formation through accretion and merging, shocks and turbulence are generated,
which may lead to gamma-ray production. In this work, the gamma-ray physics of
AGNs is briefly presented, as well as that of starburst galaxies, GRBs and
clusters of galaxies. Afterwards, we consider some particular cases of
gamma-ray production in non-blazar AGN jets interacting with their medium at
different scales.

as it collapses to form a low-mass protostar and circumstellar disk.
Two-dimensional (2D) chemodynamical models are required to properly study this
process.
  Aims: The goal of this work is to follow, for the first time, the chemical
evolution in two dimensions all the way from a pre-stellar core into a
circumstellar disk. Of special interest is the question whether the chemical
composition of the disk is a result of chemical processing during the collapse
phase, or whether it is determined by in situ processing after the disk has
formed.
  Methods: Our model combines a semi-analytical method to get 2D axisymmetric
density and velocity structures with detailed radiative transfer calculations
to get temperature profiles and UV fluxes. Material is followed in from the
core to the disk and a full gas-phase chemistry network -- including freeze-out
onto and evaporation from cold dust grains -- is evolved along these
trajectories. The abundances thus obtained are compared to the results from a
static disk model and to observations of comets.
  Results: The chemistry during the collapse phase is dominated by a few key
processes, such as the evaporation of CO or the photodissociation of H2O. At
the end of the collapse phase, the disk can be divided into zones with
different chemical histories. The disk is not in chemical equilibrium at the
end of the collapse, so care must be taken when choosing the initial abundances
for stand-alone disk chemistry models. Our model results imply that comets must
be formed from material with different chemical histories: some of it is
strongly processed, some of it remains pristine. Variations between individual
comets are possible if they formed at different positions or different times in
the solar nebula.

The TD was
predicted long ago as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) associated with the
spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale symmetry in the walking
technicolor (WTC) (initially dubbed ""scale-invariant technicolor""). Being pNGB,
the TD should have a mass M_TD lighter than other techni-hadrons like
techni-rho meson; It has recently been estimated to be M_TD ~= 500-600 GeV for
the typical WTC model, which is well in the discovery range of the ongoing LHC
experiment. Noting that all the TD couplings to the standard model (SM)
particles arise only through loop of the techni-fermions with their induced
Yukawa couplings to the composite TD, we find that the TD-WW and ZZ couplings
get dramatically suppressed compared with those of the SM Higgs which has
tree-level couplings proportional to their masses. In contrast, TD couplings to
gg, t tbar and gamma gamma are not suppressed and hence are relatively enhanced
compared to those of the SM Higgs. We explicitly evaluate the TD LHC production
cross sections at sqrt(s)=7 TeV times the branching ratios in terms of the TD
mass M_TD as an input parameter for the region 200 GeV < M_TD < 1000 GeV in the
typical WTC models. Remarkably, the WW/ZZ mode is shown to be consistent with
the recent ATLAS and CMS bounds for M_TD > 350(400) GeV in the one-doublet
(one-family) model, thanks to the suppressed WW/ZZ coupling in sharp contrast
to the SM Higgs. On the other hand, the gg, gamma gamma and t tbar modes are
not suppressed compared to the SM Higgs: Particularly in the one-family model
with M_TD ~= 500-600 GeV, the cross section times the TD -> gamma gamma
branching ratio gets gigantically enhanced to be ~ 10^(-3)-10^(-2) pb, which is
large enough to be discovered within the first-year's run at LHC and hence a
smoking-gun of the TD.

how it manifests itself during stellar eclipses and planetary transits, and the
increasingly important role its measurements play in guiding our understanding
of the formation and evolution of close binary stars and exoplanet systems.

"1109.1751","Antoon Pelsser","Antoon Pelsser","Time-Consistent Actuarial Valuations",,,,,"q-fin.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent theoretical results establish that time-consistent valuations (i.e.
pricing operators) can be created by backward iteration of one-period
valuations. In this paper we investigate the continuous-time limits of
well-known actuarial premium principles when such backward iteration procedures
are applied. We show that the one-period variance premiumprinciple converges to
the non-linear exponential indifference valuation. Furthermore, we study the
convergence of the one-period standard-deviation principle and establish that
the Cost-of-Capital principle, which is widely used by the insurance industry,
converges to the same limit as the standard-deviation principle. Finally, we
study the connections between our time-consistent pricing operators, Good Deal
Bound pricing and pricing under model ambiguity.

""principle of solidarity"" between space-time and the physical phenomena
occurring in it (formulated by the Italian matematician B. Finzi in 1955). This
is accomplished by means of a deformation of the Minkowski metric, implemented
by assuming that the metric coefficients depend on the energy of the process
considered. Such a formalism (""Deformed Special Relativity"") allows one, among
the others, to deal with the breakdown of Lorentz invariance and to recover it
in a generalized sense.

system of particles is shown to lead to the conclusion that interactions can be
represented by the action of cosets of the group. By application of this
principle to Pauli spinors, the symplectic group Sp(n) is shown to be the
largest group of isometries of the space. Interactions between particles are
represented by the complete quaternionic flag variety Sp(n)/Sp(1)^n.
