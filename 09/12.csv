Safety whose values depend on physical and mechanical soil properties analyzed

semi-empirical approach based on the use of geophysical methods and the
employment of a geophysical Factor of Safety recently introduced by the authors
in terms of local resistivities and slope angles. In this paper, we show an
application of our proposal on a test area of about 2000 m2 on Sarno Mountains
(Campania Region - Southern Italy), where shallow landslides involving
pyroclastic soils periodically occur triggered by critical rainfall events.
Starting from two resistivity tomography surveys performed on the test area in
autumn and spring, we obtained maps of the geophysical Factor of Safety at
different depths for the two seasons. We also estimated the values of the
Factor of Safety by using the infinite slope model in the dry and saturated
scenario. A comparison between the values of the geophysical and geotechnical
Factor of Safety shows advantages and disadvantages of our approach.

technique takes into account the anisotropy of the electrostatic
electron-positron interaction in the lowest order. The states due to different
values of the quantum number $(l_z)$ of angular momentum are found to be no
longer degenerate as is the case in the conventional theory. The physical
origin of this elimination of the conventional degeneracy may intuitively be
attributed to the state-dependent inertial \emph{broadening} of the rotating
charge clouds; the corresponding \emph{anisotropic} deformation (in the
quadrupole approximation) lowers then the negative electrostatic interaction
energy. The result of this influence of anisotropy is that the states with
$l_z=0$ adopt smaller binding energy whereas the states with maximal value of
$|l_z|$ (for fixed principal quantum number $n$) have the largest binding
energy within the angular momentum multiplet $(-|l_{z,\mathrm{max}}| \le l_z

discuss various shortcomings of this measure and develop a new model of problem
difficulty that corrects these deficiencies. We show that Taillards algorithm
can be modeled with high fidelity as a simple variant of a straightforward
random walk. The random walk model accounts for nearly all of the variability
in the cost required to locate both optimal and sub-optimal solutions to random
JSPs, and provides an explanation for differences in the difficulty of random
versus structured JSPs. Finally, we discuss and empirically substantiate two
novel predictions regarding tabu search algorithm behavior. First, the method
for constructing the initial solution is highly unlikely to impact the
performance of tabu search. Second, tabu tenure should be selected to be as
small as possible while simultaneously avoiding search stagnation; values
larger than necessary lead to significant degradations in performance.

satisfaction and optimization problems, such as graph coloring used in register
allocation. Graph coloring is also used to model more traditional CSPs relevant
to AI, such as planning, time-tabling and scheduling. Provably optimal
solutions may be desirable for commercial and defense applications.
Additionally, for applications such as register allocation and code
optimization, naturally-occurring instances of graph coloring are often small
and can be solved optimally. A recent wave of improvements in algorithms for
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and 0-1 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) suggests
generic problem-reduction methods, rather than problem-specific heuristics,
because (1) heuristics may be upset by new constraints, (2) heuristics tend to
ignore structure, and (3) many relevant problems are provably inapproximable.
  Problem reductions often lead to highly symmetric SAT instances, and
symmetries are known to slow down SAT solvers. In this work, we compare several
avenues for symmetry breaking, in particular when certain kinds of symmetry are
present in all generated instances. Our focus on reducing CSPs to SAT allows us
to leverage recent dramatic improvement in SAT solvers and automatically
benefit from future progress. We can use a variety of black-box SAT solvers
without modifying their source code because our symmetry-breaking techniques
are static, i.e., we detect symmetries and add symmetry breaking predicates
(SBPs) during pre-processing.
  An important result of our work is that among the types of
instance-independent SBPs we studied and their combinations, the simplest and
least complete constructions are the most effective. Our experiments also
clearly indicate that instance-independent symmetries should mostly be
processed together with instance-specific symmetries rather than at the
specification level, contrary to what has been suggested in the literature.

introduces a new formulation for the forward model in the form of a nonlinear

transform is approximated to yield a high-order misfit unction which is then
used to derive a regularized inverse problem. In particular, we consider the

improves upon the local linearization of the forward mapping. The inverse

the current state is called a decision process with non-Markovian rewards
(NMRDP). In decision-theoretic planning, where many desirable behaviours are
more naturally expressed as properties of execution sequences rather than as
properties of states, NMRDPs form a more natural model than the commonly
adopted fully Markovian decision process (MDP) model. While the more tractable
solution methods developed for MDPs do not directly apply in the presence of
non-Markovian rewards, a number of solution methods for NMRDPs have been
proposed in the literature. These all exploit a compact specification of the
non-Markovian reward function in temporal logic, to automatically translate the
NMRDP into an equivalent MDP which is solved using efficient MDP solution
methods. This paper presents NMRDPP (Non-Markovian Reward Decision Process
Planner), a software platform for the development and experimentation of
methods for decision-theoretic planning with non-Markovian rewards. The current
version of NMRDPP implements, under a single interface, a family of methods
based on existing as well as new approaches which we describe in detail. These
include dynamic programming, heuristic search, and structured methods. Using
NMRDPP, we compare the methods and identify certain problem features that
affect their performance. NMRDPPs treatment of non-Markovian rewards is
inspired by the treatment of domain-specific search control knowledge in the
TLPlan planner, which it incorporates as a special case. In the First
International Probabilistic Planning Competition, NMRDPP was able to compete
and perform well in both the domain-independent and hand-coded tracks, using
search control knowledge in the latter.

ultimately on the Etingof-Geer-Schiffmann computation of the monodromy of the
trigonometric KZ connection. It relies on two new ingredients: an affine
extension of the duality between the R-matrix of U_h(sl_k) and the quantum Weyl
group element of U_h(sl_2), and a formula expressing the quantum Weyl group
action of the coroot lattice of SL_2 in terms of the commuting generators of
U_h(Lsl_2). Using this formula, we define quantum Weyl group operators for the
quantum loop algebra U_h(Lgl_2) and show that they describe the monodromy of
the trigonometric Casimir connection on a tensor product of evaluation modules
of the Yangian Ygl_2

impulsive noises which possibly contain a large number of outliers. The
approach is of Bayesian type, and it exploits a heavy-tailed t distribution for
data noise to achieve robustness with respect to outliers. A hierarchical model
with all hyper-parameters automatically determined from the given data is
described. An algorithm of variational type by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the true posteriori distribution and a separable
approximation is developed. The numerical method is illustrated on several one-
and two-dimensional linear and nonlinear inverse problems arising from heat
conduction, including estimating boundary temperature, heat flux and heat
transfer coefficient. The results show its robustness to outliers and the fast
and steady convergence of the algorithm.

achieved in heavy-fermion compounds, which contain a dense lattice of localized
magnetic moments interacting with a sea of conduction electrons to form a 3D

would persist upon effectively reducing the dimensionality of these materials

such an ultimately strongly-correlated system of heavy electrons confined
within a 2D square-lattice of Ce-atoms (2D Kondo lattice), which was realized
by fabricating epitaxial superlattices built of alternating layers of
heavy-fermion CeCoIn5 and conventional metal YbCoIn5. The field-temperature
phase diagram of the superlattices exhibits highly unusual behaviors, including
a striking enhancement of the upper critical field relative to the transition
temperature. This implies that the force holding together the superconducting
electron-pairs takes on an extremely strong coupled nature as a result of
two-dimensionalization.

representation and accurate classification. As opposed to previous work, our
learning methodology is capable of incorporating a diverse family of
classification cost functions (including those used in popular boosting
methods), while avoiding the need for involved optimization techniques. We show
that DDL can be solved by a sequence of updates that make use of well-known and
well-studied sparse coding and dictionary learning algorithms from the

of curved thin beams, with section of order $\delta$, which takes into account
the specific geometry of such beams. A deformation $v$ is split into an
elementary deformation and a warping. The elementary deformation is the analog
of a Bernoulli-Navier's displacement for linearized deformations replacing the
infinitesimal rotation by a rotation in SO(3) in each cross section of the rod.
Each part of the decomposition is estimated with respect to the $L^2$ norm of
the distance from gradient $v$ to SO(3). This result relies on revisiting the
rigidity theorem of Friesecke-James-M\""uller in which we estimate the constant
for a bounded open set star-shaped with respect to a ball. Then we use the
decomposition of the deformations to derive a few asymptotic geometrical
behavior: large deformations of extensional type, inextensional deformations
and linearized deformations. To illustrate the use of our decomposition in
nonlinear elasticity, we consider a St Venant-Kirchhoff material and upon
various scaling on the applied forces we obtain the $\Gamma$-limit of the
rescaled elastic energy. We first analyze the case of bending forces of order
$\delta^2$ which leads to a nonlinear inextensional model. Smaller pure bending
forces give the classical linearized model. A coupled extensional-bending model
is obtained for a class of forces of order $\delta^2$ in traction and of order
$\delta^3$ in bending.

structure, called the m-Tamari lattice and denoted by T_n^(m), which
generalizes the usual Tamari lattice T_n obtained when m=1. This lattice was
introduced by F. Bergeron in connection with the study of coinvariant spaces.
He conjectured several intriguing formulas dealing with the enumeration of
intervals in this lattice. One of them states that the number of intervals in
T_n^(m) is $$ \frac {m+1}{n(mn+1)} {(m+1)^2 n+m\choose n-1}. $$ This conjecture
was proved recently, but in a non-bijective way, while its form strongly
suggests a connection with plane trees. Here, we prove another conjecture of
Bergeron, which deals with the number of labelled, intervals. An interval [P,Q]
of T_n^(m) is labelled, if the north steps of Q are labelled from 1 to n in
such a way the labels increase along any sequence of consecutive north steps.
We prove that the number of labelled intervals in T_n^(m) is $$
{(m+1)^n(mn+1)^{n-2}}. $$ The form of these numbers suggests a connection with
parking functions, but our proof is non-bijective. It is based on a recursive
description of intervals, which translates into a functional equation satisfied
by the associated generating function. This equation involves a derivative and
a divided difference, taken with respect to two additional variables. Solving
this equation is the hardest part of the paper. Finding a bijective proof
remains an open problem.

use several measurements to estimate the two contributions: observations with a
(partly) blocked FOV, a convolution of the FTS spectral atlas, imaging in the
pupil plane, umbral profiles, and spurious polarization signal in telluric
lines. The measurements allow us to estimate the spatial PSF of POLIS and the
main spectrograph of the German VTT. We use the PSF for a deconvolution of both
spectropolarimetric data and investigate the effect on the spectra. The
parasitic contribution can be directly and accurately determined for POLIS,
amounting to about 5%. We estimate a lower limit of about 10% across the full
FOV for the dispersed stray light. In quiet Sun regions, the stray-light level
from the close surroundings (d< 2"") of a given spatial point is about 20%. The
stray light reduces to below 2% at a distance of 20"" from a lit area for both

vortex pair in the vicinity of a symmetry line (or ""wall""), in order to
understand why the presence of the wall, even far from the vortices,
accelerates fluid mixing around the vortex pair. An asymptotic analysis, in the
limit of large distances to the wall, allows to approximate the wall effect as
a constant translation of the vortex pair parallel to the wall, plus a
straining flow which induces a natural blinking vortex mechanism with period
half the rotation period. A Melnikov analysis of lagrangian particles, in the
frame translating and rotating with the vortices, shows that a homoclinic
bifurcation indeed occurs, so that the various separatrices located near the
vortex pair (and rotating with it) do not survive when a wall is present. The
thickness of the resulting inner stochastic layer is estimated by using the
separatrix map method, and is shown to scale like the inverse of the squared
distance to the wall. This estimation provides a lower-bound to the numerical
thickness measured from either Poincar\'e sections or simulations of lagrangian
particles transported by the exact potential velocity field in the laboratory
frame. In addition, it is shown that the outer homoclinic cycle, separating the
vortices from the external (open) flow, is also perturbed from inside by the
rotation of the vortex pair. As a consequence, a stochastic layer is shown to
exist also in the vicinity of this cycle, allowing fluid exchange between the
vortices and the outer flow. However, the thickness of this outer stochastic
zone is observed to be much smaller than the one of the inner stochastic zone
near vortices, as soon as the distance to the wall is large enough.

strong electric field is a spectacular manifestation of the relativistic
energy-momentum relation for the Dirac fermions. This fundamental prediction of
Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) has not yet been confirmed experimentally as the
generation of a sufficiently strong electric field extending over a large
enough space-time volume still presents a challenge. Surprisingly, distant
areas of physics may help us to circumvent this difficulty. In condensed matter
and solid state physics (areas commonly considered as low energy physics), one
usually deals with quasi-particles instead of real electrons and positrons.
Since their mass gap can often be freely tuned, it is much easier to create
these light quasi-particles by an analogue of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. This
motivates our proposal of a quantum simulator in which excitations of
ultra-cold atoms moving in a bichromatic optical lattice represent particles
and antiparticles (holes) satisfying a discretized version of the Dirac
equation together with fermionic anti-commutation relations. Using the language
of second quantization, we are able to construct an analogue of the spontaneous
pair creation which can be realized in an (almost) table-top experiment.

Association Rule Mining. Generally, many algorithms use either the bottom-up or
top-down approaches for finding these frequent itemsets. When the length of
frequent itemsets to be found is large, the traditional algorithms find all the
frequent itemsets from 1-length to n-length, which is a difficult process. This
problem can be solved by mining only the Maximal Frequent Itemsets (MFS).
Maximal Frequent Itemsets are frequent itemsets which have no proper frequent
superset. Thus, the generation of only maximal frequent itemsets reduces the
number of itemsets and also time needed for the generation of all frequent
itemsets as each maximal itemset of length m implies the presence of 2m-2
frequent itemsets. Furthermore, mining only maximal frequent itemset is
sufficient in many data mining applications like minimal key discovery and
theory extraction. In this paper, we suggest a novel method for finding the
maximal frequent itemset from huge data sources using the concept of
segmentation of data source and prioritization of segments. Empirical
evaluation shows that this method outperforms various other known methods.

collaborate. Second, we modify the communication mechanism to also allow us to
focus on a sequence of communicating programs, where each program in the
sequence may successively remove some of the remaining models. This mimics a
network of leaders, where the first leader has the first say and may remove
models that he or she finds unsatisfactory. Using this particular communication
mechanism allows us to capture the entire polynomial hierarchy. This means, in
particular, that communicating ASP could be used to solve problems that are
above the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, such as some forms of
abductive reasoning as well as PSPACE-complete problems such as STRIPS
planning.

quantum field theory. It provides a geometric rationale for supersymmetry
(SUSY) and a formalism in which super-Poincare invariance follows from Poincare
invariance. HST unifies particles and black holes, realizing both as
excitations of non-commutative geometrical variables on a holographic screen.
Compact extra dimensions are interpreted as finite dimensional unitary
representations of super-algebras, and have no moduli. Full field theoretic
Fock spaces, and continuous moduli are both emergent phenomena of
super-Poincare invariant limits in which the number of holographic degrees of
freedom goes to infinity. Finite radius de Sitter (dS) spaces have no moduli,
and break SUSY with a gravitino mass scaling like $\Lambda^{1/4}$. We present a
holographic theory of inflation and fluctuations. The inflaton field is an
emergent concept, describing the geometry of an underlying HST model, rather
than ""a field associated with a microscopic string theory"". We argue that the
phrase in quotes is meaningless in the HST formalism.

supernova remnants (SNRs) in the TeV and GeV gamma-rays. Either relativistic
electrons (due to the inverse-Compton scattering) or protons (due to the pion
decays) may be responsible for this emission. In particular, the broad-band
spectra of SNRs may be explained in both leptonic and hadronic scenarios.
Another kind of observational data, namely, images of SNRs, is an important
part of experimental information. We present a method to model gamma-ray images
of Sedov SNRs in uniform media and magnetic field due to hadronic emission.
These gamma-rays are assumed to appear as a consequence of meson decays
produced in inelastic collisions of accelerated protons with thermal protons
downstream of the shock - a model would be relevant for SNRs without firm
confirmations of the shock-cloud interaction, as e.g. SN1006. Distribution of
surface brightness of the shell-like SNR is synthesized numerically for a
number of configurations. An approximate analytical formula for azimuthal and
radial variation of hadronic gamma-ray brightness close to the shock is
derived. The properties of images as well as the main factors determining the
surface brightness distribution are determined. Some conclusions which would be
relevant to SN1006 are discussed.

process by which electrons at shock fronts are accelerated to relativistic

process is applicable to a myriad of astronomical jet sources such as AGN,
X-ray binaries and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as well as to particle acceleration
in the solar wind and supernovae, and the acceleration of cosmic rays. The
accurate measurement of the distribution of p is of fundamental importance to
differentiate between the possible theories of electron acceleration at any
relativistic shock front; there is division as to whether p has a universal
value or whether it has a distribution, and if so, what that distribution is.
Here one such source of synchrotron emission is examined: the blast waves of
GRB afterglows observed by the Swift satellite. Within the framework of the GRB
blast wave model, the constraints placed on the distribution of p by the
observed X-ray spectral and temporal indices are examined and the distribution
parametrized. The results show that the observed distribution of spectral
indices is inconsistent with an underlying distribution of p composed of a
single discrete value but consistent with a Gaussian distribution centred at p
= 2.4 and having a width of 0.6. This finding disagrees with theoretical work
that argues for a single, universal value of p, but also demonstrates that the
width of the distribution is not as wide as has been suggested by some authors.

synchrotron emission due to cooling of a non-thermal electron distribution in
an equipartition magnetic field and inverse Compton emission due to the
scattering off synchrotron photons (SSC) and external soft photons (EC) by the
same distribution of electrons. We show that the VHE gamma ray flux cannot be
explained by SSC process thereby suggesting the EC mechanism as a plausible
emission process at this energy. The EC scattering of BLR photons to VHE
energies will be in Klein-Nishina regime predicting a steep spectrum which is
contrary to the observations. However the infrared photons from the dusty torus
can be boosted to VHE energies with the scattering process remaining in the
Thomson regime. Though EC process can successfully explain the observed VHE
flux, it require a magnetic field much lower than the equipartition value to
reproduce the observed X-ray flux. Hence we attribute the X-ray emission due to
SSC process. We derive the physical parameters of 3C 279 considering the above
mentioned emission processes. In addition we assume the size of emission region
constrained by a variability timescale of one day. This model can successfully
reproduce the broadband spectrum of 3C 279 but predicts substantially large

observations collected in 2009 September with ESPaDOnS at the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and covering a full span of 7d or ~2.5
orbital/rotational cycles of V4046 Sgr. Small circularly polarised Zeeman
signatures are detected in the photospheric absorption lines but not in the
accretion-powered emission lines of V4046 Sgr, thereby demonstrating that both
system components host large-scale magnetic fields weaker and more complex than
those of younger, fully-convective cTTSs of only a few Myr and similar masses.
  Applying our tomographic imaging tools to the collected data set, we
reconstruct maps of the large-scale magnetic field, photospheric brightness and
accretion-powered emission at the surfaces of both stars of V4046 Sgr. We find
that these fields include significant toroidal components, and that their
poloidal components are mostly non-axisymmetric with a dipolar component of
50-100G strongly tilted with respect to the rotation axis; given the similarity
with fields of partly-convective main-sequence stars of similar masses and
rotation periods, we conclude that these fields are most likely generated by
dynamo processes. We also find that both stars in the system show cool spots
close to the pole and extended regions of low-contrast, accretion-powered
emission; it suggests that mass accretion is likely distributed rather than
confined in well defined high-contrast accretion spots, in agreement with the
derived magnetic field complexity.

isturbance to trigger transition to turbulence in shear flows. This involves
constructing a variational problem that searches over all disturbances of fixed
initial amplitude, which respect the boundary conditions, incompressibility and
the Navier--Stokes equations, to maximise a chosen functional over an
asymptotically long time period. The functional must be selected such that it
identifies turbulent velocity fields by taking significantly enhanced values
compared to those for laminar fields. We illustrate this approach using the
ratio of the final to initial perturbation kinetic energies (energy growth) as
the functional and the energy norm to measure amplitudes in the context of pipe
flow. Our results indicate that the variational problem yields a smooth
converged solution providing the amplitude is below the threshold amplitude for
transition. This optimal is the nonlinear analogue of the well-studied (linear)
transient growth optimal. At and above this threshold, the optimising search
naturally seeks out disturbances that trigger turbulence by the end of the
period, and convergence is then practically impossible. The first disturbance
found to trigger turbulence as the amplitude is increased identifies the
`minimal seed' for the given geometry and forcing (Reynolds number). We
conjecture that it may be possible to select a functional such that the
converged optimal below threshold smoothly converges to the minimal seed at
threshold. This seems at least approximately true for our choice of energy
growth functional and the pipe flow geometry chosen here.

Blazhko effect, and the spin-down of rapid rotators. The methods proposed are
of explorative type, and can be of significant aid when performing a more

methods are based on a straightforward decomposition of the input time series
into a fast ""clocking"" periodicity and smooth modulating curves. The fast
frequency, referred to as the carrier frequency, can be obtained from earlier
observations (for instance in the case of photometric data the period can be
obtained from independently measured radial velocities), postulated using some
simple physical principles (Keplerian rotation laws in accretion disks), or
estimated from the data as a certain mean frequency. The smooth modulating
curves are described by trigonometric polynomials or splines. The data
approximation procedures are based on standard computational packages
implementing simple or constrained least-squares fit-type algorithms.

of order of the sources' size - typically less than 1 AU. Such a beam probes
matter and curvature distributions that are very different from coarse-grained

smoothed on scales much larger than 1 AU. The beam typically travels through
unclustered dark matter and hydrogen with a mean density much less than the
cosmic mean, and through dark matter halos and hydrogen clouds. Using N-body

under-dense. From this we argue that modelling the probability distribution for
AU-diameter beams is absolutely critical. Standard analyses predict a huge
variance for such tiny beam sizes, and nonlinear corrections appear to be
non-trivial. It is not even clear whether under-dense regions lead to dimming
or brightening of sources, owing to the uncertainty in modelling the expansion
rate which we show is the dominant contribution. By considering different
reasonable approximations which yield very different cosmologies we argue that
modelling ultra-narrow beams accurately remains a critical problem for
precision cosmology. This could appear as a discordance between angular
diameter and luminosity distances when comparing SN observations to BAO or CMB

depending on the detuning of the tone from the small-signal resonant frequency,

response as a function of detuning, near where the classical Duffing
bifurcation occurs. This trough has been understood as a classical interference
between two metastable responses with opposite phase. We use Wigner function
studies to show that while this picture is roughly correct, there are also more
quantum mechanical aspects to this feature. Second, at low damping we study the
emergence of sharp, discrete spectral features from a continuum response. We
show that these the structures, associated with discrete transitions between
different excited-state eigenstates of the oscillator, provide an interesting
example of a quantum Fano resonance. The trough in the Fano response evolves

sharp avoided crossings, the slow variable discretization (SVD) approach is
adopted in the region of small hyperradii. At larger hyperradii, where the
adiabatic potentials and couplings are smooth, the traditional adiabatic method
suffices. Despite the high degree of complexity, recombination into deeply

masses, as well as the occurrence rate of planetary systems around solar-type

of solar-type stars harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period up
to 100 days. Different properties are observed for the population of planets
less massive than about 30M-Earth compared to the population of gaseous giant
planets. The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets (SEN)
is strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence rate does
not exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN planets belong
to multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of the SEN planets seems
limited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence rate of gaseous giant planets

beyond. The precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to

small to explain the magnitude of $A_N$ observed in the PHENIX experiment. A
larger contribution, which does not vanish at high energies, comes from the
interference of pion and $a_1$-Reggeon exchanges. The unnatural parity of $a_1$
guarantees a substantial phase shift, although the magnitude is strongly
suppressed by the smallness of diffractive $\pi p\to a_1 p$ cross section. We
replace the Regge $a_1$ pole by the Regge cut corresponding to the $\pi\rho$
exchange in the $1^+S$ state. The production of such a state, which we treat as
an effective pole $a$, forms a narrow peak in the $3\pi$ invariant mass
distribution in diffractive $\pi p$ interactions . The cross section is large,

associated ($a$) particles are measured by the ALICE experiment in Pb-Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV for transverse momenta $0.25 <
p_{T}^{t,\, a} < 15$ GeV/$c$, where $p_{T}^t > p_{T}^a$. The shapes of the pair
correlation distributions are studied in a variety of collision centrality
classes between 0 and 50% of the total hadronic cross section for particles in
the pseudorapidity interval $|\eta| < 1.0$. Distributions in relative azimuth
$\Delta\phi \equiv \phi^t - \phi^a$ are analyzed for $|\Delta\eta| \equiv
|\eta^t - \eta^a| > 0.8$, and are referred to as ""long-range correlations"".
Fourier components $V_{n\Delta} \equiv \langle \cos(n\Delta\phi)\rangle$ are
extracted from the long-range azimuthal correlation functions. If particle
pairs are correlated to one another through their individual correlation to a
common symmetry plane, then the pair anisotropy $V_{n\Delta}(p_{T}^t, p_{T}^a)$
is fully described in terms of single-particle anisotropies $v_n (p_{T})$ as
$V_{n\Delta}(p_{T}^t, p_{T}^a) = v_n(p_{T}^t) \, v_n(p_{T}^a)$. This
expectation is tested for $1 \leq n \leq 5$ by applying a global fit of all
$V_{n\Delta} (p_{T}^t, p_{T}^a)$ to obtain the best values $v_{n}\{GF\}
(p_{T})$. It is found that for $2 \leq n \leq 5$, the fit agrees well with data
up to $p_T^a \sim 3$-4 GeV/$c$, with a trend of increasing deviation as
$p_{T}^t$ and $p_{T}^a$ are increased or as collisions become more peripheral.
This suggests that no pair correlation harmonic can be described over the full
$0.25 < p_{T} < 15$ GeV/$c$ range using a single $v_n(p_T)$ curve; such a
description is however approximately possible for $2 \leq n \leq 5$ when $p_T^a
< 4$ GeV/$c$. For the $n=1$ harmonic, however, a single $v_1(p_T$ curve is not
obtained even within the reduced range $p_T^a < 4$ GeV/$c$.

plausibly be interpreted as being caused by a helical/toroidal jet magnetic
field. Faraday Rotation is a rotation of the plane of polarization that occurs
when the polarized radiation passes through a magnetized plasma. The sign of
the RM is determined by the direction of the line-of-sight B-Field in the
region causing the Faraday Rotation, and an ordered toroidal or helical
magnetic field associated with an AGN jet will thus produce a distinctive
bilateral distribution of positive and negative RMs across the jet. We present

to city $j$, where they may infect, or be infected by, others. Starting from a
continuous time Markov description of the model the deterministic equations,
which are valid in the limit when the population of each city is infinite, are
recovered. The stochastic fluctuations about the fixed point of these equations
are derived by use of the van Kampen system-size expansion. The fixed point
structure of the deterministic equations is remarkably simple: a unique
non-trivial fixed point always exists and has the feature that the fraction of
susceptible, infected and recovered individuals is the same for each city

analogously simple dynamics: all oscillations have a single frequency, equal to
