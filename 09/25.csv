reaction-diffusion equation coupled with subsystem of ordinary differential

precancerous cells, whose proliferation is controled by growth factors
diffusing in the extracellular medium and binding to the cell surface. We

obtained in the previous work of one of the authors to a general Hill-type
production function and full parameter set. Using spectral analysis and
perturbation theory we derive conditions for the linearized stability of such

an over-complete dictionary from which every training signal can be best
approximated by a linear combination of only a few codewords. This task is
often achieved by iteratively executing two operations: sparse coding and
dictionary update. In the literature, there are two benchmark mechanisms to
update a dictionary. The first approach, such as the MOD algorithm, is
characterized by searching for the optimal codewords while fixing the sparse
coefficients. In the second approach, represented by the K-SVD method, one
codeword and the related sparse coefficients are simultaneously updated while
all other codewords and coefficients remain unchanged. We propose a novel
framework that generalizes the aforementioned two methods. The unique feature
of our approach is that one can update an arbitrary set of codewords and the
corresponding sparse coefficients simultaneously: when sparse coefficients are
fixed, the underlying optimization problem is similar to that in the MOD
algorithm; when only one codeword is selected for update, it can be proved that
the proposed algorithm is equivalent to the K-SVD method; and more importantly,
our method allows us to update all codewords and all sparse coefficients
simultaneously, hence the term simultaneous codeword optimization (SimCO).
Under the proposed framework, we design two algorithms, namely, primitive and
regularized SimCO. We implement these two algorithms based on a simple gradient
descent mechanism. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of
the proposed algorithms, as compared with two baseline algorithms MOD and
K-SVD. Results show that regularized SimCO is particularly appealing in terms
of both learning performance and running speed.

was posed as an open question whether such a result holds for uncountable

the abelian case.

(I) For small enough external densities the shell becomes kinetically dominated

unmagnetized ""thin shell"" case, which produces bright reverse shock emission
that peaks well after the prompt GRB. (II) For larger external densities the
shell remains highly magnetized and the reverse shock is strongly suppressed.
It eventually transfers most of its energy through pdV work to the shocked
external medium, whose afterglow emission peaks on a timescale similar to the
prompt GRB duration. (III) For even larger external densities there is no
initial impulsive acceleration phase. (IV) For the highest external densities
the flow remains Newtonian.

time variability. Despite such impulsive behavior, most models of these sources
assume a steady state for simplicity. Here I consider a time-dependent outflow
that is initially highly magnetized and divided into many well-separated
sub-shells, as it experiences impulsive magnetic acceleration and interacts
with the external medium. In AGN the deceleration by the external medium is
usually unimportant and most of the initial magnetic energy is naturally
converted into kinetic energy, leading to efficient dissipation in internal
shocks as the sub-shells collide. Such efficient low-magnetization internal
shocks can also naturally occur in GRBs, where the deceleration by the external
medium can be important. A strong low-magnetization reverse shock can develop,
and the initial division into sub-shells allows it to be relativistic and its
emission to peak on the timescale of the prompt GRB duration (which is not
possible for a single shell). Sub-shells also enable the outflow to reach much
higher Lorentz factors that help satisfy existing constraints on GRBs from
intrinsic pair opacity and from the afterglow onset time.

unresolved point sources, but not bright point sources. In this paper, we
introduce a foreground cleaning technique in Fourier space, which allows us to
handle all such foregrounds simultaneously and thus sidestep any special
treatments to bright point sources. Its feasibility is tested with a simulated
data cube for the 21 CentiMeter Array experiment. This data cube includes more
realistic models for the 21 cm signal, continuum foregrounds, detector noise
and frequency-dependent instrumental response. We find that a combination of
two weighting schemes can be used to protect the frequency coherence of
foregrounds: the uniform weighting in the uv plane and the inverse-variance
weighting in the spectral fitting. The visibility spectrum is therefore well
approximated by a quartic polynomial along the line of sight. With this method,
we demonstrate that the huge foreground contamination can be cleaned out
effectively with residuals on the order of \sim10 mK, while the spectrally
smooth component of the cosmological signal is also removed, bringing about
systematic underestimate in the extracted power spectrum primarily on large

centuries, i.e. without human population and productivity continuing to grow
exponentially, and without extreme events such as economic collapse or
singularity. In such a world, which is not unlike the current situation,
gigascale space projects face a combination of inhibiting factors: the enormous
cost threshold, the need for risky and costly development of often quite
application specific technology, the relatively little benefit with respect to
the costs for the sponsors, the time span of at least a few generations and the
absence of a sense of urgency. It will be argued that the best chance of
getting an interstellar project started in this generation is to establish an
international network of non governmental organizations (NGOs) focused on
private and public fundraising for interstellar exploration, similar to e.g.
the WWF. It is shown that this path reduces the massive barriers to entry as
well as the level of governmental support needed. The path is argued to fit
best with three defining features of gigascale space projects, which should be
recognized to the fullest: their almost absolute nonprofit character, their
massive cost in terms of time and resources and their non-urgency leading to
procrastination. Even if relatively modest but recurring funding is found
enough resources can be gathered over time, provided the majority of the NGOs'
income is saved up in a long term fund similar to that of the Noble Foundation

Ensemble Control encompasses a class of problems that involves the guidance of

The subject originates from the study of complex spin dynamics in Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging (MRI). A fundamental question
concerns ensemble controllability, which determines the existence of controls
that transfer the system between desired initial and target states. For
ensembles of finite-dimensional time-varying linear systems, the necessary and
sufficient controllability conditions and analytical optimal control laws have
been shown to depend on the singular system of the operator characterizing the

transitions with log-wide distributed rates. An induced current arises, which
is controlled by the strength of the driving, and an associated topological
term appears in the expression for the energy absorption rate. Due to the
sparsity, the crossover from linear response to saturation is mediated by an
intermediate regime, where the current is exponentially small in $\sqrt{N}$,
which is related to the work of Sinai on ""random walk in a random environment"".

on the time-of-arrival perturbation technique, a method for detecting moons of
pulsar planets, and the photometric transit timing technique, a method for
detecting moons of transiting planets. Realistic thresholds are derived and
analysed in the in the context of the types of moons that are likely to form
and be orbitally stable for the lifetime of the system.
  For the case of the time-of-arrival perturbation technique, the analysis is
conducted in two stages. First, a preliminary investigation is conducted
assuming that planet and moon's orbit are circular and coplanar. This analysis
is then applied to the case of the pulsar planet PSR B1620-26 b, and used to
conclude that a stable moon orbiting this pulsar planet could be detected, if
its mass was >5% of its planet's mass (2.5 Jupiter masses), and if the
planet-moon distance was ~ 2% of the planet-pulsar separation (23 AU).
Time-of-arrival expressions are then derived for mutually inclined as well as
non-circular orbits.
  For the case of the photometric transit timing technique, a different
approach is adopted. First, analytic expressions for the timing perturbation
due to the moon are derived for the case where the orbit of the moon is
circular and coplanar with that of the planet and where the planet's orbit is
circular and aligned to the line-of-sight, circular and inclined with respect
to the line-of-sight or eccentric and aligned to the line-of-sight. Second, the
timing noise is investigated analytically, for the case of white photometric
noise, and numerically, using SOHO lightcurves, for the case of realistic and
filtered realistic photometric noise. [...] Abstract truncated due to the

induces a set of synthesized channels from many instances of a memoryless
channel, such that a fraction of the synthesized channels becomes near perfect
for data transmission and the other fraction becomes near useless for this
task. Mahdavifar and Vardy have recently exploited this phenomenon to construct
codes that achieve the symmetric private capacity for private data transmission
over a degraded wiretap channel. In the current paper, we build on their work
and demonstrate how to construct quantum wiretap polar codes that achieve the
symmetric private capacity of a degraded quantum wiretap channel with a
classical eavesdropper. Due to the Schumacher-Westmoreland correspondence
between quantum privacy and quantum coherence, we can construct quantum polar
codes by operating these quantum wiretap polar codes in superposition, much
like Devetak's technique for demonstrating the achievability of the coherent
information rate for quantum data transmission. Our scheme achieves the
symmetric coherent information rate for quantum channels that are degradable
with a classical environment. This condition on the environment may seem
restrictive, but we show that many quantum channels satisfy this criterion,
including amplitude damping channels, photon-detected jump channels, dephasing
channels, erasure channels, and cloning channels. Our quantum polar coding
scheme has the desirable properties of being channel-adapted and symmetric
capacity-achieving along with having an efficient encoder, but we have not
demonstrated that the decoding is efficient. Also, the scheme may require
entanglement assistance, but we show that the rate of entanglement consumption
vanishes in the limit of large blocklength if the channel is degradable with
classical environment.

dispersed in an insulating matrix the electrical connectedness is established
by interparticle tunneling or hopping processes. These systems are
intrinsically non-percolative and a coherent description of the functional
dependence of the conductivity $\sigma$ on the filler properties, and in
particular of the conductor-insulator transition, requires going beyond the
usual continuum percolation approach by relaxing the constraint of a fixed
connectivity distance. In this article we consider dispersions of conducting
spherical particles which are connected to all others by tunneling conductances
and which are subjected to an effective attractive square well potential. We
show that the conductor-insulator transition at low contents $\phi$ of the
conducting fillers does not determine the behavior of $\sigma$ at larger
concentrations, in striking contrast to what is predicted by percolation
theory. In particular, we find that at low $\phi$ the conductivity is governed
almost entirely by the stickiness of the attraction, while at larger $\phi$
values $\sigma$ depends mainly on the depth of the potential well. As a
consequence, by varying the range and depth of the potential while keeping the
stickiness fixed, composites with similar conductor-insulator transitions may
display conductivity variations of several orders of magnitude at intermediate
and large $\phi$ values. By using a recently developed effective medium theory
and the critical path approximation we explain this behavior in terms of
dominant tunneling processes which involve interparticle distances spanning
different regions of the square-well fluid structure as $\phi$ is varied. Our
predictions could be tested in experiments by changing the potential profile

of generalized information measures, where a series of convex functions and
multiplicative likelihood ratios are nested alternately. While these
information measures can be viewed as a special case of the most general
Zakai-Ziv generalized information measure, this special nested structure calls
for attention and motivates our study. Specifically, a certain choice of the
convex functions leads to an information measure that extends the notion of the
Bhattacharyya distance (or the Chernoff divergence): While the ordinary
Bhattacharyya distance is based on the (weighted) geometric mean of two
replicas of the channel's conditional distribution, the more general
information measure allows an arbitrary number of such replicas. We apply the
data processing inequality induced by this information measure to a detailed
study of lower bounds of parameter estimation under additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) and show that in certain cases, tighter bounds can be obtained by
using more than two replicas. While the resulting lower bound may not compete
favorably with the best bounds available for the ordinary AWGN channel, the
advantage of the new lower bound, relative to the other bounds, becomes
significant in the presence of channel uncertainty, like unknown fading. This
different behavior in the presence of channel uncertainty is explained by the
convexity property of the information measure.

Zoo and SDSS DR7. The galaxies lie in the redshift range $0.04<z<0.1$ and have
stellar masses larger than $logM_*=10.4$. We select only face-on spiral
galaxies in order to avoid contamination by light from the disk in the SDSS
fiber and enabling the robust visual identification of spiral structure.
Overall, we find that galaxies with larger central stellar velocity
dispersions, regardless of morphological type, have older ages, higher
metallicities, and an increased overabundance of alpha-elements. Age and
alpha-enhancement, at fixed velocity dispersion, do not depend on morphological
type. The only parameter that, at a given velocity dispersion, correlates with
morphological type is metallicity, where the metallicity of the bulges of
spiral galaxies is 0.07 dex higher than that of the ellipticals. However, for
galaxies with a given total stellar mass, this dependence on morphology
disappears. Under the assumption that, for our sample, the velocity dispersion
traces the mass of the bulge alone, as opposed to the total mass (bulge+disk)
of the galaxy, our results imply that the formation epoch of galaxy and the
duration of its star-forming period are linked to the mass of the bulge. The
extent to which metals are retained within the galaxy, and not removed as a
result of outflows, is determined by the total mass of the galaxy.

strengthens this interpretation and reinforces the idea that field equations in

from the two factors. The original superstring and the reduced model are in
direct correspondence at the classical level but their relation at the quantum
level remains an open question. As was found earlier, the one-loop partition
functions of the two theories computed on the respective classical backgrounds
match; here we explore the fate of this relation at the two-loop level. We
consider the example of the reduced theory solution corresponding to the long
folded spinning string in AdS. The logarithm of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring
partition function computed on the spinning string background is known to be
proportional to the universal scaling function which depends on the string
tension ~ \l^{1/2} where \l=\lambda is `t Hooft coupling. Its ""quantum"" part is
f(\l) = a1 + \l^{-1/2} a2 + ... where the one-loop term is a1 = - 3 \ln 2 and
the two-loop term is minus the Catalan's constant, a2=-K. We find that the
counterpart of f(\l) in the reduced theory is f'(k) =a1' + 2 k^{-1} a2' + ...,
where k is the coupling of the reduced theory. Here the one-loop coefficient is
the same as in the string theory, a1'= a1, while the two-loop one is a2' =a2 -
1/4 (a1)^2. Remarkably, the first Catalan's constant term here matches the
string theory result if we identify the two couplings as k= 2\l^{1/2}.
Nevertheless, the presence of the additional (a1)^2 ~ (\ln 2)^2 term implies
that a relation between the two quantum partition functions (if any) is not a
simple equality. Similar results are found in the case of AdS_3 x S^3
superstring theory where a1= - 2 \ln 2 and a2=0, while in the corresponding
reduced theory a1'=a1, a2'= a2- 1/4 (a1)^2.

Teichm\""{u}ller space obtained by integer (2\pi-) graftings on any hyperbolic
surface projects to a dense set, which implies that complex projective surfaces
with any fixed Fuchsian holonomy are dense in moduli space.

experiment at LHC is presented. By the analysis of Bose-Einstein enhancement in
the correlation function of identical pions information on the size and
evolution of the source region in space-time can be obtained. The source radii
observed at LHC are larger than at RHIC, approximately scaling with the cube
root of the particle multiplicity. A decrease of source radii with increasing
pair momentum, indicating a collective expansion of the medium, was observed at
RHIC and SPS and is also expected at LHC energies. The ALICE data confirm this
and provide strict constraints on dynamical models describing the medium
expansion. The results suggest that the created fireball has a higher
temperature and a longer lifetime as compared to lower energies.

field distribution in type-II superconductors in the vortex state. Based on the
determination of the magnetic penetration depth it is frequently
speculated---also controversially---about the order-parameter symmetry of the
studied superconductors. This article reports on a combined muSR and
magnetization study of the mixed state in the cuprate high-temperature
superconductor La_{1.83}Sr_{0.17}CuO_{4} in a low magnetic field of 20 mT
applied along the c axis of a single crystal. The macroscopic magnetization
measurements reveal substantial differences for various cooling procedures.
Yet, indicated changes in the vortex dynamics between different temperature
regions as well as the results of the microscopic muSR experiments are
virtually independent of the employed cooling cycles. Additionally, it is found
that the mean magnetic flux density, locally probed by the muons, strongly
increases at low temperatures. This can possibly be explained by a non-random
sampling of the spatial field distribution of the vortex lattice in this
cuprate superconductor caused by intensified vortex pinning.
