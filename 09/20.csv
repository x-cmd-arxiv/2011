Their frequency spectra range from very simple, with few frequencies, to very
rich, with more than fifty peaks in some cases. Balloon09 is a hybrid pulsating
subdwarf B, showing a large number of p- and g-modes including a triplet and a
quintuplet-like structures which are interpreted as p-mode frequency splittings
due to stellar rotation. Photometric observations undertaken in two subsequent
years revealed a change in these rotational splittings of 0.24 - 0.58
{\mu}Hz/yr. Aims. We analyse the possibility of angular momentum interchange
between stellar rotation and internal gravity waves as a mechanism for the
observed rotational splitting variations. Methods. The expected change in the
rotational splitting of eigenmodes resulting from this mechanism are computed
in the nonadiabatic linear approximation for a stellar structure model that is
representative of the target star. The fact that g-modes are also observed in
Balloon09 makes it a particularly suitable candidate for our study, because the
change in the rotational splittings are proportional to the amplitude squared
of the g-modes which, in this case, can be estimated from the observations.
Results. We find that this mechanism is able to predict changes in the
splittings that can be of the same order of magnitude as the observed
variations.

Hall state, which is more complicated than the edge of the 1/3 state because of
the presence of a continuum of quasi-degenerate edge sectors corresponding to
different partitions of composite fermions in the lowest two {\Lambda} levels.
The addition of an electron at the edge is a non-perturbative process and it is
not a priori obvious in what manner the added electron distributes itself over
these sectors. We show, from a microscopic calculation, that when an electron
is added at the edge of the ground state in the [N_1, N_2] sector, where N_1
and N_2 are the numbers of composite fermions in the lowest two {\Lambda}
levels, the resulting state lies in either [N_1 + 1, N_2] or [N_1, N_2 + 1]
sector; adding an electron at the edge is thus equivalent to adding a composite
fermion at the edge. The coupling to other sectors of the form [N_1 + 1 + k,
N_2 - k], k integer, is negligible in the asymptotically low-energy limit. This
study also allows a detailed and substantial comparison with the two-boson
model of the 2/5 edge. We compute the spectral weights and find that while the
individual spectral weights are complicated and non-universal, their sum is
consistent with an effective two-boson description of the 2/5 edge.

the solvation free energy linear functional demonstrate that goal-oriented
indicators are not sufficient on their own to lead to a superior refinement
algorithm. To remedy this, we propose a problem-specific marking strategy using
the solvation free energy computed from the solution of the linear regularized
Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The convergence of the solvation free energy using
this marking strategy, combined with goal-oriented refinement, compares
favorably to adaptive methods using an energy-based error indicator. Due to the
use of adaptive mesh refinement, it is critical to use multilevel
preconditioning in order to maintain optimal computational complexity. We use
variants of the classical multigrid method, which can be viewed as
generalizations of the hierarchical basis multigrid and Bramble-Pasciak-Xu
(BPX) preconditioners.

previously, we find a change in the average albedo when comparing the inner,
middle, and outer portions of the Main Belt. We also confirm that the albedo

objects with similar albedos in regions of the Main Belt associated with
dynamical breakup families. Asteroid families typically show a characteristic
albedo for all members, but there are notable exceptions to this. This paper is

It is found that the quantum correlations of the emitted photons, degraded by
the energy splitting of the intermediate levels in the radiative cascade can be
efficiently revived by a far detuned external field. The physics of this
revival is linked to an induced stark shift and the formation of dressed states
in the system by the non-resonant external field. Further, we investigated the
competition between the effect of the coherent external field and incoherent
dephasing of the intermediate levels. We found that the degradation of quantum
correlations due to the incoherent dephasing can be content for small dephasing
with the external field. We also studied the non-locality of the correlations
by evaluating the Bell's inequality in the linear polarization basis for the
radiative cascade. We find that the Bell parameter decreases rapidly with
increase in the intermediate level energy splitting or incoherent dephasing
rate to the extent that there is no violation. However, the presence of an
external field leads to control over the degrading mechanisms and preservation
of nonlocal correlation among the photons. This in turn can induce, violation
of Bell's inequality in the radiative cascade for arbitrary intermediate level
splitting and small incoherent dephasing.

storage used in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. In our setting,
electricity is generated from PV and is used to supply the demand from loads.
Excess electricity generated from the PV can be stored in a battery to be used
later on, and electricity must be purchased from the electric grid if the PV
generation and battery discharging cannot meet the demand. Due to the
time-of-use electricity pricing, electricity can also be purchased from the
grid when the price is low, and be sold back to the grid when the price is
high. The objective is to minimize the cost associated with purchasing from (or
selling back to) the electric grid and the battery capacity loss while at the
same time satisfying the load and reducing the peak electricity purchase from
the grid. Essentially, the objective function depends on the chosen battery
size. We want to find a unique critical value (denoted as $C_{ref}^c$) of the
battery size such that the total cost remains the same if the battery size is
larger than or equal to $C_{ref}^c$, and the cost is strictly larger if the
battery size is smaller than $C_{ref}^c$. We obtain a criterion for evaluating
the economic value of batteries compared to purchasing electricity from the
grid, propose lower and upper bounds on $C_{ref}^c$, and introduce an efficient
algorithm for calculating its value; these results are validated via
simulations.

both models are in broad agreement with the experimental trends, but only the
dumbbell simulations can match the experimental data quantitatively. The level

important players in determining collective motion of the bacterial bath, and

overlay multicast network for streaming live media events over the Internet.
The class of overlay networks constructed by our algorithm include networks
used by Akamai Technologies to deliver live media events to a global audience
with high fidelity. We construct networks consisting of three stages of nodes.
The nodes in the first stage are the entry points that act as sources for the
live streams. Each source forwards each of its streams to one or more nodes in
the second stage that are called reflectors. A reflector can split an incoming
stream into multiple identical outgoing streams, which are then sent on to
nodes in the third and final stage that act as sinks and are located in edge
networks near end-users. As the packets in a stream travel from one stage to
the next, some of them may be lost. A sink combines the packets from multiple
instances of the same stream (by reordering packets and discarding duplicates)
to form a single instance of the stream with minimal loss. Our primary
contribution is an algorithm that constructs an overlay network that provably
satisfies capacity and reliability constraints to within a constant factor of
optimal, and minimizes cost to within a logarithmic factor of optimal. Further
in the common case where only the transmission costs are minimized, we show
that our algorithm produces a solution that has cost within a factor of 2 of
optimal. We also implement our algorithm and evaluate it on realistic traces
derived from Akamai's live streaming network. Our empirical results show that
our algorithm can be used to efficiently construct large-scale overlay networks
in practice with near-optimal cost.

planes of Cu1+ ions in a O-Cu1+-O dumbbell configuration, in the spectral range
0.75-6.5 eV at temperatures 7 -300 K. The spectra of the dielectric function
for light polarized parallel to the Cu1+ planes reveal a strong in-plane
anisotropy of the interband excitations. Strong and sharp absorption bands
peaked at 3.45 eV (3.7 eV) dominate the spectra for polarization along
(perpendicular) to the Cu2+O2 chains. They are superimposed on flat and
featureless plateaux above the absorption edges at 2.25 eV (2.5 eV). Based on
density-functional calculations, the anomalous absorption peaks can be assigned
to transitions between bands formed by Cu1+ 3dxz(dyz) and Cu2+ 3dxy orbitals,
strongly hybridized with O pstates. The major contribution to the background
response comes from transitions between Cu1+ 3dz2 and 4px(py) bands. This
assignment accounts for the measured in-plane anisotropy. The dielectric
response along the Cu2+O2 chains develops a weak two-peak structure centered at
2.1 and 2.65 eV upon cooling below 100 K, along with the appearance of spin
correlations along the Cu2+O2 chains. These features bear a striking
resemblance to those observed in the single-valent Cu2+O2 chain compound
LiCuVO4, which were identified as an exciton doublet associated with
transitions to the upper Hubbard band that emerges as a consequence of the
long-range Coulomb interaction between electrons on neighboring Cu2+ sites
along the chains. An analysis of the spectral weights of these features yields
the parameters characterizing the on-site and long-range Coulomb interactions.

quantum entanglement measures was discovered over ten years ago. More
precisely, it was shown by Monte Carlo simulations that there exist states for
which the entanglement of formation and the negativity do not impose the same
ordering of states, i.e. $E_{F}(\rho_{AB}) \leq (\geq)
E_{F}(\rho_{AB}^{\prime})$ is not equivalent to $N(\rho_{AB}) \leq (\geq)
N(\rho_{AB}^{\prime})$. Recently, it was discovered that quantum discord and
the geometric quantum discord do not necessarily imply the same ordering of
two-qubit $X$-states, which means that the lack of the unique ordering of
states with quantum entanglement measures goes beyond entanglement. Inspired by
this observation, we study the problem of the states ordering with quantum
discords, considering two-qubit Bell-diagonal states for analytical simplicity.
In particular, we identify some classes of states for which the states ordering

formation in the dense parts of clusters, where models of isolated collapsing
cores may not apply. Each core accretes at a constant rate onto its protostar,
while the surrounding clump gas accretes as a power of protostar mass. Short
accretion flows resemble Shu accretion, and make low-mass stars. Long flows
resemble reduced Bondi accretion and make massive stars. Accretion stops due to
environmental processes of dynamical ejection, gravitational competition, and
gas dispersal by stellar feedback, independent of initial core structure. The
model matches the field star IMF from 0.01 to more than 10 solar masses. The
core accretion rate and the mean accretion duration set the peak of the IMF,
independent of the local Jeans mass. Massive protostars require the longest
accretion durations, up to 0.5 Myr. The maximum protostar luminosity in a
cluster indicates the mass and age of its oldest protostar. The distribution of
protostar luminosities matches those in active star-forming regions if
protostars have a constant birthrate but not if their births are coeval. For
constant birthrate, the ratio of YSOs to protostars indicates the star-forming
age of a cluster, typically ~1 Myr. The protostar accretion luminosity is
typically less than its steady spherical value by a factor of ~2, consistent
with models of episodic disk accretion.

disk evolution and planet formation in single star systems. However, the

companions on protoplanetary disks is an important element in our understanding
of planet formation. We have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census of
Taurus-Auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, in
order to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. Our results imply
that the tidal influence of a close (<40 AU) binary companion significantly
hastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ~2/3 of all close
binaries promptly disperse their disks within <1 Myr after formation. However,
prompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and
single stars, with ~80%-90% retaining their disks for at least ~2--3 Myr (but
rarely for more than ~5 Myr). Our new constraints on the disk clearing
timescale have significant implications for giant planet formation; most single
stars have 3--5 Myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most close
binary systems would have to form giant planets within <1 Myr. If core
accretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in
close binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a
similar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity
in RV surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is
very well-matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the
disk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation.

dramatic variations in mid-infrared spectral slope on timescales at least as
short as the satellite orbital period ~95 mins. There is also significant
change during one pair of observations spaced by only 11 s. These variations
imply that the spectral break associated with the transition from self-absorbed

wavelength range of ~3-22 microns that WISE is sensitive to, and more. Based on
four-band simultaneous mid-infrared detections, the break lies at ~5x10^{13} Hz

270 kpc of the host galaxy. Color-magnitude diagrams of these dwarfs, however,
show clear evidence of episodic star formation (\Delta{}t ~ a few Gyr) over
cosmic time. We present a simple model to account for this behaviour. Residual
gas within the weak gravity field of the dwarf experiences dramatic variations
in the gas cooling time around the eccentric orbit. This variation is due to
two main effects. The azimuthal compression along the orbit leads to an
increase in the gas cooling rate of ~([1+\epsilon]/[1-\epsilon])^2. The
Galaxy's ionizing field declines as 1/R^2 for R>R_disk although this reaches a
floor at R~150 kpc due to the extragalactic UV field ionizing intensity. We
predict that episodic SF is mostly characteristic of dwarfs on moderately
eccentric orbits (\epsilon>0.2) that do not come too close to the centre
(R>R_disk) and do not spend their entire orbit far away from the centre (R>200
kpc). Up to 40% of early infall dwarf spheroidals can be expected to have
already had at least one burst since the initial epoch of star formation, and
10% of these dwarf spheriodals experiencing a second burst. Such a model can
explain the timing of bursts in the Carina dwarf spheroidal and restrict the
orbit of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal. However, this model fails to explain why
some dwarfs, such as Ursa Minor, experience no burst post-infall.

higher than the radiative efficiency of such optically thin flows. For BZ

solutions and retrograde flow provides a slightly larger value of the

local star formation law in which the star formation rate per unit area in each
patch of a galaxy scales linearly with the molecular gas surface density,
recent observations of both Milky Way molecular clouds and high redshift
galaxies apparently show a more complicated relationship, in which regions of
equal surface density can form stars at quite different rates. These data have
been interpreted as implying either that different star formation laws apply in
different circumstances, that the star formation law is sensitive to
large-scale galaxy properties rather than local properties, or that there are
high density thresholds for star formation. Here we collate resolved
observations of Milky Way molecular clouds, kpc-scale observations of Local
Group galaxies, and unresolved observations of both disk and starburst galaxies
in the local universe and at high redshift. We show that all of these data are
in fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star formation law. The
apparent variations stem from the fact that the observed objects have a wide
variety of 3D size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixed
gas column density the regions being observed can have wildly varying volume
densities. We provide a simple theoretical framework to remove this projection
effect, and we show that all the data, from small Solar neighborhood clouds
with masses ~10^3 Msun to sub-mm galaxies with masses ~10^11 Msun, fall on a
single star formation law in which the SFR is simply ~1% of the molecular gas
mass per local free-fall time. In contrast, proposed star formation laws in
which the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation period or
the SFR is linearly proportional to the gas mass above some density threshold

observations of the cluster. Our survey reaches down to I~22 mag and Ks~18 mag.
There is significant differential reddening within the cluster. We find a
bimodal distribution for Av, with a peak at ~3 mag and a broader peak at ~10
mag. We find a ~20% fraction of Class I/Class II young stellar objects (YSOs)
in the cluster, while a large 80% fraction of the sources have a Class III
classification. We have made use of the IPHAS survey in order to probe the
strength in Halpha emission for this large population of Class III sources.
Nearly all of the Class III objects have photospheric (r'-Halpha) colors,
implying an absence of Halpha in emission. This large population of Class III
sources is thus likely the extincted field star population rather than the
diskless YSOs in the cluster. There is a higher concentration of the Class I/II
systems in the eastern region of the cluster and close to the central
Trapezium. The western part of the cluster mostly contains Class III/field
stars and seems devoid of disk sources. We find evidence of a pre-main sequence
population in NGC 6823, in addition to an upper main-sequence population. The
pre-main sequence population mainly consists of young disk sources with ages
between ~1-5 Myr, and at lower masses of ~0.1-0.4 Msun. There may be a possible
mass dependent age spread in the cluster, with the older stars being more
massive than the younger ones. The presence of young disk sources in NGC 6823
indicates similar star formation properties in the outer regions of the Galaxy
as observed for young clusters in the solar neighborhood.

Majorana or Dirac nature of the neutrino, and aid in understanding the neutrino
absolute mass scale and hierarchy. Future 76Ge-based searches target a
half-life sensitivity of >10^27 y to explore the inverted neutrino mass
hierarchy. Reaching this sensitivity will require a background rate of <1 count
tonne^-1 y^-1 in a 4-keV-wide spectral region of interest surrounding the Q
value of the decay. We investigate the overburden required to reach this
background goal in a tonne-scale experiment with a compact (copper and lead)
shield based on Monte Carlo calculations of cosmic-ray background rates. We
find that, in light of the presently large uncertainties in these types of
calculations, a site with an underground depth >~5200 mwe is required for a
tonne-scale experiment with a compact shield similar to the planned 40-kg
MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. The required overburden is highly dependent on the
chosen shielding configuration and could be relaxed significantly if, for
example, a liquid cryogen and water shield, or an active neutron shield were
employed. Operation of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR and GERDA detectors will serve
to reduce the uncertainties on cosmic-ray background rates and will impact the
choice of shielding style and location for a future tonne-scale experiment.

triplet pairing that spontaneously break time reversal symmetry. Interestingly,
the pairing is qualitatively different at low and high dopings, and undergoes a
first order transition with doping. At high dopings, it is smoothly connected
to a paired state of electrons propagating with the underlying free particle
dispersion. However, at low dopings the dispersion is strongly influenced by
the magnetic exchange, and is entirely different from the free particle band
structure. Here the superconductivity is fully gapped and topological,
analogous to spin polarized electrons with px+ipy pairing. These results may be
relevant to honeycomb lattice iridates such as A2IrO3 (A=Li or Na) on doping.

so-called twin-like models opens up, that is, of different field theories which

twin-like models were first introduced in Phys. Rev. D 82, 105006 (2010), Ref.

receptors in large macromolecular complexes is necessarily based on local
interactions and consequently is fundamentally connected to slowing of receptor
conformational dynamics, which increases intrinsic noise. Therefore, it is not
clear whether or under what conditions cooperativity actually increases the
precision of the concentration measurement. We explictly calculate the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sensing a concentration change using a simple,
Ising-type model of receptor-receptor interactions, generalized via scaling
arguments, and find that the optimal SNR is always achieved by independent

the intergalactic gas of Stephan's Quintet. The major features of the group,
such as the extended tidal features and the group-wide shock, enabled us to
constrain the models reasonably well, while trying to reproduce multiple
features of the system. We found that reconstructing the two long tails
extending from NGC 7319 toward NGC 7320c one after the other in two separate
encounters is very difficult and unlikely, because the second encounter usually
destroys or distorts the already-generated tidal structure. Our models suggest
the two long tails may be formed simultaneously from a single encounter between
NGC 7319 and 7320c, resulting in a thinner and denser inner tail than the outer
one. The tails then also run parallel to each other as observed. The model
results support the ideas that the group-wide shock detected in
multi-wavelength observations between NGC 7319 and 7318b and the starburst
region north of NGC 7318b are triggered by the high-speed collision between NGC
7318b and the intergalactic gas. Our models show that a gas bridge is formed by
the high-speed collision and clouds in the bridge continue to interact for some
tens of millions of years after the impact. This produces many small shocks in

hydrostatic mass, which do not deviate significantly from expectations for
normal systems, spanning a range typical of rich groups and poor clusters of

a central AGN, or superposition of multiple massive halos. Two-thirds of the

extremes. The method described utilizes results from spatial statistics and
extreme value theory to first model extremes in the weather as a max-stable
process, and then use these models to simulate payments for a general
collection of weather derivatives. These simulations capture the spatial
dependence of payments. Incorporating results from catastrophe ratemaking, we
show how this method can be used to compute risk loads and premiums for weather

clustering and environmental dependence of the number of substructures in a

is sensitive at the tens of percent level to the surrounding density and to a
lesser extent to asymmetry of the surrounding density distribution. We compute
the autocorrelation function of halos as a function of occupation, building on
the finding of Wechsler et al. (2006) and Gao and White (2007) that halos (at
fixed mass) with more substructure are more clustered. We compute the relative
bias as a function of occupation number at fixed mass, finding a strong
relationship. At fixed mass, halos in the top 5% of occupation can have an
autocorrelation function ~ 1.5-2 times higher than the mean. We also compute
the bias as a function of halo mass, for fixed halo occupation. We find that
for group and cluster sized halos, when the number of subhalos is held fixed,
there is a strong anticorrelation between bias and halo mass. Such a
relationship represents an additional challenge to the halo model.

integrated in a 1-degree radius around R.A.=56.24^{\circ}, Dec.=23.78^{\circ}
(J2000) is 2.15 +/- 0.12 Jy at 22.8 GHz, where AME is dominant. COSMOSOMAS data
show no significant emission, but allow to set upper limits of 0.94 and 1.58 Jy
(99.7% C.L.) respectively at 10.9 and 14.7 GHz, which are crucial to pin down
the AME spectrum at these frequencies, and to discard any other emission
mechanisms which could have an important contribution to the signal detected at
22.8 GHz. We estimate the expected level of free-free emission from an
extinction-corrected H-alpha template, while the thermal dust emission is
characterized from infrared DIRBE data and extrapolated to microwave
frequencies. When we deduct the contribution from these two components at 22.8
GHz the residual flux, associated with AME, is 2.12 +/- 0.12 Jy (17.7-sigma).
The spectral energy distribution from 10 to 60 GHz can be accurately fitted
with a model of electric dipole emission from small spinning dust grains
distributed in two separated phases of molecular and atomic gas, respectively.
  The dust emissivity, calculated by correlating the 22.8 GHz data with
100-micron data, is found to be 4.36+/-0.17 muK/MJy/sr, a value that is rather
low compared with typical values in dust clouds. The physical properties of the
Pleiades nebula indicate that this is indeed a much less opaque object than
others were AME has usually been detected. This fact, together with the broad
knowledge of the stellar content of this region, provides an excellent testbed
for AME characterization in physical conditions different from those generally
explored up to now.

constellation pair} (UFCP) is proposed for the systematic design of a
noncoherent full diversity collaborative unitary space-time block code by
normalizing two Alamouti codes for a wireless communication system having two
transmitter antennas and a single receiver antenna. It is proved that such a
unitary UFCP code assures the unique identification of both channel
coefficients and transmitted signals in a noise-free case as well as full
diversity for the noncoherent maximum likelihood (ML) receiver in a noise case.
To further improve error performance, an optimal unitary UFCP code is designed
by appropriately and uniquely factorizing a pair of energy-efficient cross
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to maximize the coding
gain subject to a transmission bit rate constraint. After a deep investigation
of the fractional coding gain function, a technical approach developed in this
paper to maximizing the coding gain is to carefully design an energy scale to
compress the first three largest energy points in the corner of the QAM
constellations in the denominator of the objective as well as carefully design
a constellation triple forming two UFCPs, with one collaborating with the other
two so as to make the accumulated minimum Euclidean distance along the two
transmitter antennas in the numerator of the objective as large as possible and
at the same time, to avoid as many corner points of the QAM constellations with
the largest energy as possible to achieve the minimum of the numerator. In
other words, the optimal coding gain is attained by intelligent constellations
collaboration and efficient energy compression.

which provides a measure of the dust column density times the intensity of

a clear 4000 Angstrom break and broad Mg b absorption. This is consistent with
scattered starlight, and the continuum of the DGL is well-reproduced by a
simple radiative transfer model of the Galaxy. We also detect line emission in
H\alpha, H\beta, [N II], and [S II], consistent with scattered light from the

undergoes a first-order fluid-solid transition. Non-equilibrium filling,
through random sequential adsorption with diffusion, creates amorphous
structures and terminates at a disordered state with random closest packing
density that lies in the equilibrium solid regime. The approach towards random
closest packing is characterized by two distinct power-law regimes, reflecting
the formation of small densely packed grains in the long time regime of the

a system where helpers with low-rate backhaul but high storage capacity cache
popular video files. Files not available from helpers are transmitted by the

distinguish between the uncoded case (where only complete files are stored) and
the coded case, where segments of Fountain-encoded versions of the video files
are stored at helpers. We show that the uncoded optimum file assignment is
NP-hard, and develop a greedy strategy that is provably within a factor 2 of
the optimum. Further, for a special case we provide an efficient algorithm
achieving a provably better approximation ratio of $1-(1-1/d)^d$, where $d$ is
the maximum number of helpers a user can be connected to. We also show that the
coded optimum cache assignment problem is convex that can be further reduced to
a linear program. We present numerical results comparing the proposed schemes.

novel class of Polya-Gamma distributions. Our main contributions are to build
up the relevant distributional theory and to demonstrate three useful features
of this data-augmentation scheme. First, it leads to simple EM and
Gibbs-sampling algorithms for posterior inference, circumventing the need for
analytic approximations, numerical integration, Metropolis--Hastings, or
variational methods. Second, it allows modelers much more flexibility when
choosing priors, which have traditionally come from the Dirichlet or
logistic-normal family. For example, our approach allows users to incorporate
Bayesian analogues of classical penalized-likelihood techniques (e.g. the lasso
or bridge) in computing regularized estimates for log-odds ratios. Finally, our
data-augmentation scheme naturally suggests a default strategy for prior
selection based on the logistic-Z model, which is strongly related to Jeffreys'
prior for a binomial proportion. To illustrate the method we focus primarily on
the particular case of a meta-analysis/multi-center study (or a JxKxN table).
But the general approach encompasses many other common situations, of which we

dissipative effects. Working in unitary gauge we couple a set of composite
operators in the effective action which is constrained solely by invariance
under time-dependent spatial diffeomorphisms. We restrict ourselves to
situations where the degrees of freedom responsible for dissipation do no
contribute to the density perturbations at late time. The dynamics of the
perturbations is then modified by the appearance of `friction' and noise terms,
and assuming certain locality properties for the Green's functions of these
composite operators, we show that there is a regime characterized by a large
friction term \gamma >> H in which the \zeta-correlators are dominated by the
noise and the power spectrum can be significantly enhanced. We also compute the
three point function <\zeta\zeta\zeta> for a wide class of models and discuss
under which circumstances large friction leads to an increased level of
non-Gaussianities. In particular, under our assumptions, we show that strong
dissipation together with the required non-linear realization of the symmetries
implies |f_NL| ~ \gamma/(c_s^2H) >> 1. As a paradigmatic example we work out a
variation of the `trapped inflation' scenario with local response functions and
perform the matching with our effective theory. A detection of the generic type
of signatures that result from incorporating dissipative effects during
inflation, as we describe here, would teach us about the dynamics of the early
universe and also extend the parameter space of inflationary models.

approximately circular orbits and are likely to have white dwarf companions.
PSR J1017-7156 has a high flux density and a narrow pulse width, making it
ideal for precision timing experiments. PSRs J1446-4701 and J1125-5825 are
coincident with gamma-ray sources, and folding the high-energy photons with the
radio timing ephemeris shows evidence of pulsed gamma-ray emission. PSR
J1502-6752 has a spin period of 26.7 ms, and its low period derivative implies
that it is a recycled pulsar. The orbital parameters indicate it has a very low
mass function, and therefore a companion mass much lower than usually expected
for such a mildly recycled pulsar. In addition we present polarisation profiles
for all 12 MSPs discovered in the HTRU survey to date. Similar to previous
observations of MSPs, we find that many have large widths and a wide range of
linear and circular polarisation fractions. Their polarisation profiles can be
highly complex, and although the observed position angles often do not obey the
rotating vector model, we present several examples of those that do. We
speculate that the emission heights of MSPs are a substantial fraction of the
light cylinder radius in order to explain broad emission profiles, which then
naturally leads to a large number of cases where emission from both poles is
observed.

cost-effective and scalable framework for sharing user-generated contents. This
paper addresses the intrinsic incentive problems residing in social networks
using a game-theoretic model where individual users selfishly trade off the
costs of forming links (i.e. whom they interact with) and producing contents
personally against the potential rewards from doing so. Departing from the
assumption that contents produced by difference users is perfectly
substitutable, we explicitly consider heterogeneity in user-generated contents
and study how it influences users' behavior and the structure of social
networks. Given content heterogeneity, we rigorously prove that when the
population of a social network is sufficiently large, every (strict)
non-cooperative equilibrium should consist of either a symmetric network
topology where each user produces the same amount of content and has the same
degree, or a two-level hierarchical topology with all users belonging to either
of the two types: influencers who produce large amounts of contents and
subscribers who produce small amounts of contents and get most of their
contents from influencers. Meanwhile, the law of the few disappears in such
networks. Moreover, we prove that the social optimum is always achieved by
networks with symmetric topologies, where the sum of users' utilities is
maximized. To provide users with incentives for producing and mutually sharing
the socially optimal amount of contents, a pricing scheme is proposed, with
which we show that the social optimum can be achieved as a non-cooperative
equilibrium with the pricing of content acquisition and link formation.

^{+4.6}_{-4.0} ^{+0.5}_{-0.6} ^{+0.2}_{-0.9} MeV, where the first, second and
third uncertainties are statistical, systematic and model, respectively. For
the electron partial width two possible solutions have been found:
  (1) \Gamma_{ee} = 154 ^{+79}_{-58} ^{+17}_{-9} ^{+13}_{-25} eV, (2)
\Gamma_{ee} = 414 ^{+72}_{-80} ^{+24}_{-26} ^{+90}_{-10} eV.
  Our statistics are insufficient to prefer one solution to another. The
solution (2) mitigates the problem of non-$D\bar{D}$ decays but is disfavored
by potential models.
  It is shown that taking into account the resonance--continuum interference in
the near-threshold region affects resonance parameters, thus the results
presented can not be directly compared with the corresponding PDG values
obtained ignoring this effect.

the system into Birkhoff's normal form. Lie transforms reduce the system to an
equivalent simpler system which is immediately solvable. Applying Arnold's
theorem, we have found non-linear stability criteria. We conclude that $L_6$ is

propagators in Eulerian coordinates are closely related to the velocity field

the dependence of the propagators on the detailed shape of the underlying
Lagrangian-space tessellations, that is, on the geometry of the regions that
eventually collapse to form halos. We illustrate these results for both the 1D

understanding the nature and abundance of the dust and the chemical abundances
in the DLA absorbers. Composite spectra were constructed for the full sample
and several subsamples, chosen on the basis of absorber and QSO properties.
Average extinction curves were obtained for the samples by comparing their
geometric mean composite spectra with those of two samples of QSOs, matching in
z$_{em}$ and i magnitude with the DLA sample, one sample without any absorbers
along their lines of sight and the other without any DLAs along their lines of
sight irrespective of the presence of other absorption systems. While the
average reddening in the DLA sample is small, we find definite evidence for the
presence of dust in subsamples based on absorber properties, in particular the
strength of metal absorption lines. DLAs along lines of sight to QSOs which are
not colour selected are found to be more dusty compared to those along the
lines of sight to the more numerous colour selected QSOs. From these studies
and from the strengths of absorption lines in the composite spectra, we
conclude that $\le$ 10% of the DLAs in SDSS DR7 cause significant reddening,
have stronger absorption lines and have higher abundances as compared to the
rest of the sample. The rest of the sample shows little reddening. Due to the
dominant color selection method used to target QSOs in the SDSS DR7, this
fraction of 10% likely represents a lower limit for the global fraction of
dusty DLAs at high-z.

natural in the context of seesaw models with Dirac neutrino mass matrix,

$\theta_{23}$ lie above maximality. The atmospheric mixing angle, $\theta_{23}$
is found to dictate the possible hierarchies in type I and II neutrino mass

When this happens, the accreted material is rapidly mixed within the surface
convective zone and induces an inverse mean-molecular-weight gradient, unstable
for thermohaline convection. The induced mixing, which dilutes the metal
excess, may also have important consequences on the light elements abundances.
We model and analyze this process, and present the results according to various

The article presents an approach that extracts request handling logic from
regular stage functionality into a set of request scripts. These scripts are
executed step-wise by sending continuations that encapsulate their request's
current execution state to stages for local processing and optional forwarding
of follow-up continuations. A new internal domain specific language (DSL) that
aims to simplify writing of request scripts is described along with its

of galaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) with the Einasto halo
model, which has emerged as the best-fitting model of the halos arising in
dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations. We find that the RCs are
significantly better fit with the Einasto halo than with either a
pseudo-isothermal sphere (Iso) or Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo models. In our
best-fit models, the radius of density slope -2 and the density at this radius
are highly correlated. The Einasto index, which controls the overall shape of
the density profile, is near unity on average for intermediate and low mass
halos. This is not in agreement with the predictions from LCDM simulations. The
indices of the most massive halos are in rough agreement with those of
cosmological simulations and appear correlated with the halo virial mass. We
find that a typical Einasto density profile declines more strongly in its
outermost parts than any of the Iso or NFW models whereas it is relatively
shallow in its innermost regions. The core nature of those regions of halos
thus extends the cusp-core controversy found for the NFW model with low surface
density galaxies to the Einasto halo with more massive galaxies like those of
THINGS. We thus find that the Einasto halo model provides, so far, the best
match to the observed RCs, and can therefore be considered as a new standard
model for dark matter halos.

evolutionary biology and social science. Traditional game theory studies the
equilibria of simple games. But is traditional game theory applicable if the
game is complicated, and if not, what is? We investigate this question here,
defining a complicated game as one with many possible moves, and therefore many
possible payoffs conditional on those moves. We investigate two-person games in
which the players learn based on experience. By generating games at random we
show that under some circumstances the strategies of the two players converge
to fixed points, but under others they follow limit cycles or chaotic
attractors. The dimension of the chaotic attractors can be very high, implying
that the dynamics of the strategies are effectively random. In the chaotic
regime the payoffs fluctuate intermittently, showing bursts of rapid change
punctuated by periods of quiescence, similar to what is observed in fluid
turbulence and financial markets. Our results suggest that such intermittency
is a highly generic phenomenon, and that there is a large parameter regime for
which complicated strategic interactions generate inherently unpredictable
behavior that is best described in the language of dynamical systems theory

N~4*10^6. We have studied regular lattices with dimension D<=4 as well as
Erdos-Renyi random graphs, which are infinite dimensional objects. In all cases
the quantum critical behaviour is found to be controlled by an infinite
disorder fixed point, in which disorder plays a dominant role over quantum
fluctuations. As a consequence the renormalization procedure as well as the
obtained critical properties are asymptotically exact for large systems. We
have also studied Griffiths singularities in the paramagnetic and the
ferromagnetic phases and generalized the numerical algorithm for another random
quantum systems.

PEO/PMMA blends found that for short times the self-dynamics of PEO chain
follows the Rouse model, but at longer times past tc=1 to 2 ns it becomes
slower and departs from the Rouse model in dependences on time, momentum
transfer, and temperature. To explain the anomalies, others had proposed the
random Rouse model (RRM) in which each monomer has different mobility taken
from a broad log-normal distribution. Despite the success of the RRM, Diddens,
Brodeck and Heuer [EPL, 95, 56003 (2011)] extracted the distribution of
friction coefficients from the MD simulations of a PEO/PMMA blend and found the
distribution is much narrower than expected from the RRM. We propose a simpler
alternative explanation of the data by utilizing alone the observed crossover
of PEO chain dynamics at tc. The present problem is just a special case of a
general property of relaxation in interacting systems, which is the crossover
from independent relaxation to coupled many-body relaxation at some tc
determined by the interaction potential. The generality is brought out vividly
by pointing out that the crossover also had been observed by neutron scattering
from entangled chains relaxation in monodisperse homo-polymers, and from the
segmental \alpha-relaxation of PEO in blends with PMMA. The properties of all
the relaxation processes in connection with the crossover are similar, despite
the length-scales of the relaxation in these systems are widely different.

vertices consist of pairs $(f,x)$ where $f$ is a labeling of the vertices of

between $(f,x)$ and $(g,y)$ in $\CG^\diamond$ if and only if $x$ is adjacent to

moves from a configuration $(f,x)$ by updating $x$ to $y$ using the transition
rule of $X$ and then sampling both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ according to the uniform

$AdS_5\times S^5$ black hole, we in this note use the spacelike flavor current
to probe the internal structure of one holographic quark-gluon plasma, which is
described by the Sakai-Sugimoto model at high temperature phase (i.e., the
chiral symmetric phase). The plasma structure function is extracted from the
retarded flavor current-current correlator. Our main aim here is to explore the
effect of non-conformality on these physical quantities. As usual, our study is
under the supergravity approximation and the limit of large color number.
Although the Sakai-Sugimoto model is non-conformal, which makes the
calculations more involved than the well-studied $\mathcal {N}$=4 SYM case, the
result seems to indicate that the non-conformality has little essential effect
on the physical picture of the internal structure of holographic plasma, which
is consistent with the intuition from the asymptotic freedom of QCD at high
energy. While the physical picture underlying our investigation is same as the
DIS off the $\mathcal {N}$=4 SYM plasma with(out) flavor, the plasma structure
functions are quantitatively different, especially their scaling dependence on
the temperature, which can be recognized as model-dependent. As a comparison,
we also do the same analysis for the non-critical version of the Sakai-Sugimoto
model which is conformal in the sense that it has a constant dilaton vacuum.
The result for this non-critical model is much similar to the conformal
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma. We therefore attribute the above difference to the
effect of non-conformality of the Sakai-Sugimoto model.

(hydrophilic behavior), a droplet of water beads up on the same surface

influence of the microscopic structure of the surface and the strength of
adhesive (surface-water) interactions on surface hydrophobicity. We show that
at low relative humidity, the competition between adhesion and the favorable
entropy of being in the vapor phase determines the surface coverage. However,
at saturation, it is the competition between adhesion and cohesion (water-water
interactions) that determines surface hydrophobicity. The adhesive interactions
in talc are strong enough to overcome the unfavorable entropy, and water
adsorbs strongly on talc surfaces. However, they are too weak to overcome the
cohesive interactions, and water thus beads up on talc surfaces. Surprisingly,
even (talc-like) surfaces that are highly adhesive, do not fully wet at
saturation. Instead, a water droplet forms on top of a strongly adsorbed
monolayer of water. Our results imply that the interior of hydrophobic zeolites
suspended in water may contain adsorbed water molecules at pressures much

reduce the size of intermediate results and the number of join operations --

components: a VUV solar telescope with a 30 cm diameter mirror and a focal
length of 3.6 m, and a focal-plane package composed of VUV spectrometers
covering six carefully chosen wavelength ranges between 17 and 127 nm. The

are able to decrease the size of the largest A opinion cluster, and even
destroy it. We see this kind of method in operation, e.g when companies send
free new products to potential customers in order to convince them to adopt the

are positioned at random. In strategy II, the contrarians are chosen to be the
highest degrees nodes. We find that for both strategies the size of the largest
A cluster decreases to zero as p increases as in a phase transition. At a
critical threshold value p_c the system undergoes a second-order phase
transition that belongs to the same universality class of mean field

lack permanent infrastructure and are formed among mobile nodes on demand.
Rapid node mobility results in dramatic channel variation, or fading, that
degrades MANET performance. Employing channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter can improve the throughput of routing and medium access control
(MAC) protocols for mobile ad hoc networks. Several routing algorithms in the
literature explicitly incorporate the fading signal strength into the routing
metric, thus selecting the routes with strong channel conditions. While these
studies show that adaptation to the time-variant channel gain is beneficial in
MANETs, they do not address the effect of the outdated fading CSI at the
transmitter. For realistic mobile node speeds, the channel gain is rapidly
varying, and becomes quickly outdated due the feedback delay. We analyze the
link throughput of joint rate adaptation and adaptive relay selection in the
presence of imperfect CSI. Moreover, for an 802.11 network that employs
geographic opportunistic routing with adaptive rate and relay selection, we
propose a novel method to reduce the effect of the feedback delay at the MAC
layer in the presence of Rayleigh fading. This method exploits channel
reciprocity and fading prediction and does not require significant modification
to the existing 802.11 frame structure. Extensive network simulations
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the throughput,
delay, and packet delivery ratio for high mobile velocities relative to
previously proposed approaches that employ outdated CSI at the transmitter.

curves, hardness-intensity diagrams and spectra. We fitted the broadband data
with phenomenological, then physical, models to study the emission coming from
the distinct components. Based on the energy spectra, the source evolved from
the canonical hard state to the canonical soft state. The source showed X-ray
spectral variations that were correlated with changes in radio, NIR and optical
emission. The bolometric flux increased from 0.8 to 2.9*10^{-8} erg cm^{-2}
s^{-1} while the relative flux and contribution of the hot medium globally
decreased. Reprocessing in the disc was likely to be strong at the end of our
observations. The source showed a behaviour similar to that of previous
outbursts, with some small deviations in the hard X-rays parameters' evolution.
The radio, NIR and optical emission from jets was detected, and seen to fade as
the source softened. The results are discussed within the context of disc and
jet models.

to work. The instability can be seen upto the co-latitude of 30 degrees, above

lens candidates selected from a combination of the quasar sample from the SDSS

image quality together with a wider range of wavelength for the selection
process. In previous pilot surveys we observed 5 objects, finding 2 lenses;
here we present further observations of 20 objects in which we find 4 lenses,
of which 2 are independently discovered in SQLS (in preparation). Following
earlier work on the combination of these two surveys, we have refined our
method and find that use of a colour-separation diagnostic, where we select for
separations between components which appear to decrease in wavelength, is an
efficient method to find lensed quasars and may be useful in ongoing and future
large-scale strong lensing surveys with instruments such as Pan-STARRS and
LSST. The new lenses have mostly high flux ratios, with faint secondaries
buried in the lensing galaxy and typically 6-10 times less bright than the
primary. Our survey brings the total number of lenses discovered in the SDSS
quasar sample to 46, plus 13 lenses already known. This is likely to be up to
60-70% of the total number of lensed quasars; we briefly discuss strategies by
which the rest might be found.

several chemical barriers were introduced, viz: Fe and Nb, (ii) the strands
were encased in various outer-sheath materials, viz.: monel, Cu+monel,
monel+glidcop, Nb+monel, (iii) the filament counts were varied (1, 18, and 36),
and (iv) the final strand diameter was varied. In addition, for a subset of the
strand designs several B powder and C-dopant types were investigated.
Specifically, two types of amorphous B powder were used: (i) Moissan based
""Tangshan boron"" (ii) ""SMI-boron"" which is produced in a plasma torch by the
reduction-by-hydrogen of BCl3. Two approaches to C doping were taken: (i)
""malic-acid treatment"" in which C is introduced into the B powder precursor by
the moderate temperature drying out a slurry of B mixed in with a
malic-acid-toluene solution (during which the malic acid decomposes leaving C
as the only solid residue) before the Mg powder is mixed in; (ii) direct C
doping of the SMI-produced B by introducing a known percentage of CH4 into the
plasma flame. Critical current densities, Jc, were measured on 1.5 m long
samples at 4.2 K in fields of up to 14 T; of all the strands measured, that
doped with SMI-C at a nominal 4 mol% C (in relation B) yielded the highest Jc
values e.g 1.1x105 A/cm2 at 7 T, 4.5x104 at 10 T, and 2.2x104 A/cm2 at 12 T.
The n-values are given for all strands at 5 and 10 T, and for a certain set of
strands the magnetic field dependencies of the n-values and the influence of
C-doping is presented. Finally we demonstrate that, over a wide range of B,
log(Jc) decreases linearly with B with a slope -{\alpha} such that the Jc(B) of
any strand can be parameterized in terms of {\alpha} and its zero-field
intercept Jc(B=0).

the magnetic field in sunspots from an observational point of view. We start by
offering a brief description of tools that are most commonly employed to infer
the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere with emphasis in the photosphere of
sunspots. We then address separately the global and local magnetic structure of
sunspots, focusing on the implications of the current observations for the
different sunspots models, energy transport mechanisms, extrapolations of the
magnetic field towards the Corona and other issues.

  in power-law cosmology","Matches the version published in Monthly Notices of the Royal
  Astronomical Society. The definitive version is available at
  www.blackwell-synergy.com","MNRAS 422 (2012) 2532-2538","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.20810.x",,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we show that the expansion history of the Universe in
power-law cosmology essentially depends on two crucial parameters, namely the
Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and deceleration parameter $q$. We find the constraints
on these parameters from the latest $H(z)$ and SNe Ia data. At 1$\sigma$ level
the constraints from $H(z)$ data are obtained as $q=-0.18_{-0.12}^{+0.12}$ and
$H_{0}=68.43_{-2.80}^{+2.84}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ while the constraints from
the SNe Ia data read as $q=-0.38_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ and
$H_{0}=69.18_{-0.54}^{+0.55}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We also perform the joint
test using $H(z)$ and SNe Ia data, which yields the constraints
$q=-0.34_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ and $H_{0}=68.93_{-0.52}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$. The estimates of $H_{0}$ are found to be in close agreement with
some recent probes carried out in the literature. The analysis reveals that the
observational data successfully describe the cosmic acceleration within the
framework of power-law cosmology. We find that the power-law cosmology
accommodates well the $H(z)$ and SNe Ia data. We also test the power-law
cosmology using the primordial nucleosynthesis, which yields the constraints
$q\gtrsim 0.72$ and $H_{0}\lesssim 41.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. These
constraints are found to be inconsistent with the ones derived from the $H(z)$
and SNe Ia data. We carry out the statefinder analysis, and find that the
power-law cosmological models approach the standard $\Lambda$CDM model as
$q\rightarrow -1$. Finally, we conclude that despite having several good
features power-law cosmology is not a complete package for the cosmological
purposes.

these spinor equations under space-time transformation and under charge
conjugation are studied. The expressions for electric charge and current and
densities of the $W^{\pm}$ fields are obtained. Covariant quantization
conditions are established, and the vacuum energy for the $W^{\pm}$ fields is
found to be zero.
