the horizon scale, if neglected, may induce biases on the measured values of
the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we study the impact of general
relativistic effects on non standard cosmologies such as scenarios with a time
dependent dark energy equation of state, with a coupling between the dark
energy and the dark matter fluids or with non-Gaussianities. We then explore
whether general relativistic corrections affect future constraints on
cosmological parameters in the case of a constant dark energy equation of state
and of non-Gaussianities. We find that relativistic corrections on the power
spectrum are not expected to affect the foreseen errors on the cosmological
parameters nor to induce large biases on them.

(0.64<z<1.0) using the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) at 850
and 450 um. The targets, of similar richness and redshift, are selected from
the Red-sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). We use this sample to investigate the
apparent excess of submillimetre source counts in the direction of cluster
fields compared to blank fields. The sample consists of three galaxy clusters
that exhibit multiple optical arcs due to strong gravitational lensing, and a
control group of four clusters with no apparent strong lensing. A tentative
excess of 2.7-sigma is seen in the number density of submillimetre luminous
galaxies (SMGs) within the lensing cluster fields compared to that in the
control group. Ancillary observations at radio, mid-infrared, optical, and
X-ray wavelengths allow for the identification of counterparts to many of the
SMGs. Utilizing photometric redshifts, we conclude that at least three of the
galaxies within the lensing fields have redshifts consistent with the clusters
and implied infrared luminosities of ~10^12 Lsol. The existence of SMG cluster
members may therefore be boosting source counts in the lensing cluster fields,
which might be an effect of the dynamical state of those clusters. However, we
find that the removal of potential cluster members from the counts analysis
does not entirely eliminate the difference between the cluster samples. We also
investigate possible occurrences of lensing between background SMGs and lower-z
optical galaxies, though further observations are required to make any
conclusive claims. Although the excess counts between the two cluster samples
have not been unambiguously accounted for, these results warrant caution for
interpreting submillimetre source counts in cluster fields and point source
contamination for Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys. [Abridged]

that in addition to estimating the communication-delay, the adaptive strategy
could be used to simultaneously identify other parameters, such as e.g., the

Moreover, we derive the second-order coherence function for uniformly

in detection-time between two Unruh-Dewitt detectors with the same acceleration

the Unruh effect is fundamentally local, in the sense that the notion of

intermediate-luminosity transients that brighten several orders of magnitude
from a previously optically obscured state. The origin of their eruptions is
not understood. Our multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy from maximum
light to more than a year later provide a record of its post-eruption behavior.
We describe its changing spectral-energy distribution, the evolution of its
absorption- and emission line-spectrum, the development ofa bipolar outflow,
and the rapid transition from a dense wind to an optically thin ionized wind.
In addition to strong, narrow hydrogen lines, the F-type absorption-line
spectrum of the transient is characterized by strong Ca II and [Ca II]
emission. The very broad wings of the Ca II triplet and the asymmetric [Ca II]
emission lines are due to strong Thomson scattering in the expanding ejecta.
Post-maximum, the hydrogen and Ca II lines developed double-peaked emission
profiles that we attribute to a bipolar outflow. Between approximately 60 and
100 days after maximum, the F-type absorption spectrum, formed in its dense
wind, weakened and the wind became transparent to ionizing radiation. We
discuss the probable evolutionary state of the transient and similar objects
such as SN 2008S, and conclude thatthey were most likely post-red supergiants
or post-AGB stars on a blue loop to warmer temperatures when the eruption
occurred. These objects are not LBVs.

and rotating black holes as described by observers who fall into the black
holes at late times, long after any perturbations of the exterior region have
decayed. In the strict limit of late infall times, the initial experiences of
such observers are precisely described by the region of the limiting stationary
geometry to the past of its inner horizon. However, we argue that late
infall-time observers encounter a null shockwave at the location of the
would-be outgoing inner horizon. In particular, for spherically symmetric black
hole spacetimes we demonstrate that freely-falling observers experience a
metric discontinuity across this shock, that is, a gravitational shock-wave.
Furthermore, the magnitude of this shock is at least of order unity. A similar
phenomenon of metric discontinuity appears to take place at the inner horizon
of a generically-perturbed spinning black hole. We compare the properties of
this null shockwave singularity with those of the null weak singularity that
forms at the Cauchy horizon.

context of the Standard Model with three and four generations (SM3 and SM4,
respectively). In light of the recent results from LHC the triviality bound in
the SM3 has now become obsolete, and the stability bound implies for a Higgs
mass of e.g. mH=115 GeV the onset of new physics before 650 TeV, whereas there
are no limits for mH>133 GeV. For the SM4, the stability and triviality curves
intersect and bound a finite region. As a consequence, the fourth generation
fermions place stringent theoretical limits on the Higgs mass, and there is a
maximal scale beyond which the theory cannot be perturbatively valid. We find
that the Higgs mass cannot exceed 700 GeV for any values of the fourth
generation fermion masses. Turning the argument around, the absence of a Higgs
signal for mH<600 GeV excludes a fourth generation with quark masses below 300
GeV and lepton masses below 350 GeV. In particular, the quark bounds also hold
for the small mixing scenarios for which the direct limits from Tevatron and
LHC are not applicable, and the lepton bounds we obtain are stronger than the
collider limits. If a Higgs boson lighter than 700 GeV is not observed, a
fourth generation of chiral fermions with perturbative Yukawa couplings will be
conclusively excluded for the full range of parameters.

from below by a strict positive constant that is $0<C\le f$ then it does not
have much impact on the stable solutions, however, a nonnegative weight that is
$0\le f$ will push certain critical dimensions. This analytical observation has
potential to be applied in various models to push certain well-known critical

results from the combined effect of innumerable local perturbations due to
individually virializing systems, overlapping together in a
smoothly-inhomogeneous adjustment of the FRW metric, in a process governed by
the causal flow of inhomogeneity information outward from each clumped system.

restrictive limits upon backreaction are not applicable in a physically

resort to Dark Energy, any modification to gravity, or a local void.
Simultaneously, these models can reproduce measured cosmological parameters
such as the age of the universe, the matter density required for spatial
flatness, the present-day deceleration parameter, and the angular scale of the
Cosmic Microwave Background to within a reasonable proximity of their
Concordance values. A potential observational signature for distinguishing this

  Mathematical Models",,,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phosphorelays are a class of signaling mechanisms used by cells to respond to
changes in their environment. Phosphorelays (of which two-component systems
constitute a special case) are particularly abundant in prokaryotes and have
been shown to be involved in many fundamental processes such as stress
response, osmotic regulation, virulence, and chemotaxis. We develop a general
model of phosphorelays extending existing models of phosphorelays and
two-component systems. We analyze the model analytically under the assumption
of mass-action kinetics and prove that a phosphorelay has a unique stable
steady-state. Furthermore, we derive explicit functions relating stimulus to
the response in any layer of a phosphorelay and show that a limited degree of
ultrasensitivity (the ability to respond to changes in stimulus in a
switch-like manner) in the bottom layer of a phosphorelay is an intrinsic
feature which does not depend on any reaction rates or substrate amounts. On
the other hand, we show how adjusting reaction rates and substrate amounts may
lead to higher degrees of ultrasensitivity in intermediate layers. The explicit
formulas also enable us to prove how the response changes with alterations in
stimulus, kinetic parameters, and substrate amounts. Aside from providing
biological insight, the formulas may also be used to avoid time-consuming
simulations in numerical analyses and simulations.

gauge bosons arise from strings ending on stacks of D-branes, whereas chiral
matter arises from strings stretched between intersecting D-branes. Our focus
is on scattering amplitudes (at tree-level), Regge states (string excitations),
and collider phenomenology. Achieving a low string scale is possible in models
of Large extra dimensions. At the LHC, a low enough string scale implies that
cross sections will deviate from their standard model predictions. Moreover,
Regge states as well as Kaluza-Klein states and winding states may be produced.
In a large class of intersecting D-brane models, the quark-gluon amplitudes
with at most 2 quarks turn out to be independent of the geometry of the extra
dimensions. Therefore these type of amplitudes, which we call ""universal
amplitudes"", are model independent. The universal amplitudes involve exchanges
of Regge states only, whereas amplitudes with more then 2 quarks also involve
exchanges of KK and winding states. The main computational part of this work is
concerned with suggesting methods to calculate the decay widths of the Regge
states, and with the formalism for treating amplitudes containing exchanges of
higher spin particles.

the context of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). It works as follows: use a
secret but fixed Strongly Universal$_2$ (SU$_2$) hash function and encrypt the
output tag with a one-time pad (OTP). If the OTP is completely secret, the
expected time for an adversary to create a tag for a chosen message is
exponential in the tag length. If, however, the OTP is partially known in each
authentication round, as is the case in practical QKD protocols, then the
picture is different; the adversary's partial knowledge of the OTP in each
authentication round gives partial information on the secret hash function, and
this weakens the authentication in later rounds. The effect of this is that the
lifetime of the system is linear in the length of the fixed key. This is
supported by the composability theorem for QKD, that in this setting provides
an upper bound to the security loss on the secret hash function, which is
exponential in the number of authentication rounds. This needs to be taken into
account when using the protocol, since the authentication gets weakened at each
subsequent round and thus the QKD generated is key is not as strong as when the
authentication is strong. Some countermeasures are discussed at the end of this
paper.

some aspects of this result are puzzling even from the perspective of the wild
quantum-gravity literature, where arguments in favor of the possibility of
superluminal propagation have been presented, but not considering the
possibility of such a sizeable effect for neutrinos of such low energies. We
feel this must encourage particularly severe scrutiny of the OPERA result. On
the other side, we notice that the OPERA result is reasonably consistent with
$\mu$-neutrino-speed data previously obtained at FERMILAB, reported in papers
of 2007 and 1979. And it is intriguing that these FERMILAB79 and FERMILAB07
results, when combined with the new OPERA result, in principle provide a window
on $\mu$-neutrino speeds at different energies broad enough to compare
alternative phenomenological models. We test the discriminating power of such
an approach by using as illustrative examples the case of special-relativistic
tachyons, the case of ""Coleman-Glashow-type"" momentum-independent violations of
the special-relativistic speed law, and the cases of linear and quadratic
energy dependence of the speed of ultrarelativistic muon neutrinos. Even just
using $\mu$-neutrino data in the range from $\sim$ 3 GeVs to $\sim$ 200 GeVs
the special-relativistic tachyon and the quadratic-dependence case are clearly
disfavoured. The linear-dependence case gives a marginally consistent picture

elliptical galaxies are bimodal. Based on the assumed linear relationship
between GC colors and their metallicities, the bimodality has been taken as
evidence of two GC subsystems with different metallicities in each galaxy and
led to a number of theories in the context of galaxy formation. More recent
observations and modeling of GCs, however, suggest that the color-metallicity
relations (CMRs) are inflected, and thus colors likely trace metallicities in a
nonlinear manner. The nonlinearity could produce bimodal color distributions
from a broad underlying metallicity spread, even if it is unimodal. Despite the
far-reaching implications, whether CMRs are nonlinear and whether the
nonlinearity indeed causes the color bimodality are still open questions. Given
that the spectroscopic refinement of CMRs is still very challenging, we here
propose a new photometric technique to probe the possible nonlinear nature of
CMRs. In essence, a color distribution of GCs is a ""projected"" distribution of
their metallicities. Since the form of CMRs hinges on which color is used, the
shape of color distributions varies depending significantly on the colors.
Among other optical colors, the u-band related colors (e.g., u - g and u - z)
are theoretically predicted to exhibit significantly less inflected CMRs than
other preferred CMRs (e.g., for g - z). As a case study, we performed the
HST/WFPC2 archival u-band photometry for the M87 (NGC 4486) GC system with
confirmed color bimodality. We show that the u-band color distributions are
significantly different from that of g - z, and consistent with our model
predictions. With more u-band measurements, this method will support or rule
out the nonlinear-CMR scenario for the origin of GC color bimodality with high
confidence. [Abridged]

not only minimizes the bias due to masked regions in the field, it also reduces
spurious peak counts from shape noise by a factor of ~ 3 in the cosmologically

ultimate fate of such systems. We focus on binaries whose total mass exceeds
the maximum mass (Mmax) a cold, degenerate EOS can support against
gravitational collapse. The time and length scales span many orders of
magnitude, making fully general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) simulations
computationally prohibitive. For this reason, we model the WD as a
""pseudo-white dwarf"" (pWD) as in our binary WDNS head-on collisions study
[PRD83:064002,2011]. Our GRHD simulations of a pWDNS system with a
0.98-solar-mass WD and a 1.4-solar-mass NS show that the merger remnant is a
spinning Thorne-Zytkow-like Object (TZlO) surrounded by a massive disk. The
final total rest mass exceeds Mmax, but the remnant does not collapse promptly.
To assess whether the object will ultimately collapse after cooling, we
introduce radiative thermal cooling. We first apply our cooling algorithm to
TZlOs formed in WDNS head-on collisions, and show that these objects collapse
and form black holes on the cooling time scale, as expected. However, when we
cool the spinning TZlO formed in the merger of a circular-orbit WDNS binary,
the remnant does not collapse, demonstrating that differential rotational
support is sufficient to prevent collapse. Given that the final total mass
exceeds Mmax, magnetic fields and/or viscosity may redistribute angular
momentum and ultimately lead to delayed collapse to a BH. We infer that the
merger of realistic massive WDNS binaries likely will lead to the formation of
spinning TZlOs that undergo delayed collapse.

observed metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) between the two prime
stellar components of early-type galaxies-globular clusters (GCs) and halo
field stars. This is generally taken as evidence of highly decoupled
evolutionary histories between GC systems and their parent galaxies. Here we
show, however, that new developments in linking the observed GC colors to their
intrinsic metallicities suggest nonlinear color-to-metallicity conversions,
which translate observed color distributions into strongly-peaked, unimodal
MDFs with broad metal-poor tails. Remarkably, the inferred GC MDFs are similar
to the MDFs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and those
produced by chemical evolution models of galaxies. The GC MDF shape,
characterized by a sharp peak with a metal-poor tail, indicates a virtually
continuous chemical enrichment with a relatively short timescale. The
characteristic shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in the host
galaxy mass, suggesting a universal process of chemical enrichment among
various GC systems. Given that GCs are bluer than field stars within the same
galaxy, it is plausible that the chemical enrichment processes of GCs ceased
somewhat earlier than that of field stellar population, and if so, GCs
preferentially trace the major, vigorous mode of star formation events in
galactic formation. We further suggest a possible systematic age difference
among GC systems, in that the GC systems in more luminous galaxies are older.
This is consistent with the downsizing paradigm of galaxies and supports
additionally the similar nature shared by GCs and field stars. Our findings
suggest that GC systems and their parent galaxies have shared a more common
origin than previously thought, and hence greatly simplify theories of galaxy
formation.

advanced our knowledge of extrasolar planets in recent years. Since hot Jupiter
systems can be regarded as analogs of high contrast binaries, ground-based
infrared long baseline interferometers have the potential to resolve them and
detect their thermal emission with precision closure phase - a method that is
immune to the systematic errors induced by the Earth's atmosphere. In this
work, we present closure phase studies toward direct detection of nearby hot
Jupiters using the CHARA interferometer array outfitted with the MIRC
instrument. We carry out closure phase simulations and conduct a large number
of observations for the best candidate {\upsion} And. Our experiments suggest
the method is feasible with highly stable and precise closure phases. However,
we also find much larger systematic errors than expected in the observations,
most likely caused by dispersion across different wavelengths. We find that
using higher spectral resolution modes (e.g., R=150) can significantly reduce
the systematics. By combining all calibrators in an observing run together, we
are able to roughly recalibrate the lower spectral resolution data, allowing us
to obtain upper limits of the star-planet contrast ratios of {\upsion} And b
across the H band. The data also allow us to get a refined stellar radius of
1.625\pm0.011 R\odot. Our best upper limit corresponds to a contrast ratio of
2.1\times10^3:1 with 90% confidence level at 1.52{\mu}m, suggesting that we are
starting to have the capability of constraining atmospheric models of hot
Jupiters with interferometry. With recent and upcoming improvements of
CHARA/MIRC, the prospect of detecting emission from hot Jupiters with closure
phases is promising.

dependence of starquake frequency and energetics on the relative strength of
the poloidal (B_p) and toroidal (B_tor) components. We find that, for B_p
>~10^{14}G, since a strong crustal toroidal field B_tor B_p is quickly formed
on a Hall timescale, the initial toroidal field needs to be B_tor >> B_p to
have a clear influence on the outbursting behaviour. For initial fields B_p <~
10^{14}G, it is very unlikely that a middle-age (t~10^5 years) NS shows any
bursting activity. This study allows us to solve the apparent puzzle of how NSs
with similar dipolar magnetic fields can behave in a remarkably different way:
an outbursting 'magnetar' with a high X-ray luminosity, or a quiet,
low-luminosity, ""high-$B$"" radio pulsar. As an example, we consider the
specific cases of the magnetar 1E2259+586 and the radio pulsar PSRJ1814-1744,
which at present have a similar dipolar field ~6x10^{13}G. We determine for
each object an initial magnetic field configuration that reproduces the
observed timing parameters at their current age. The same two configurations
also account for the differences in quiescent X-ray luminosity and for the
'magnetar/outbursting' behaviour of 1E2259+586 but not of PSRJ1814-1744. We
further use the theoretically predicted surface temperature distribution to
compute the light-curve for these objects. In the case of 1E2259+586, for which

pulse profile whose double-peaked nature and modulation level is consistent
with the observations.

observations have largely confirmed many of the properties of this model, which
is based on a partitioning of the universe's energy density into three primary
constituents: matter, radiation, and a hypothesized dark energy which, in
LambdaCDM, is assumed to be a cosmological constant Lambda. Yet with this
progress, several unpalatable coincidences (perhaps even inconsistencies) have
emerged along with the successful confirmation of expected features. One of
these is the observed equality of our gravitational horizon R_h(t_0) with the
distance ct_0 light has traveled since the big bang, in terms of the current
age t_0 of the universe. This equality is very peculiar because it need not
have occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now)
in the context of LambdaCDM. In this paper, we propose an explanation for why
this equality may actually be required by GR, through the application of
Birkhoff's theorem and the Weyl postulate, at least in the case of a flat
spacetime. If this proposal is correct, R_h(t) should be equal to ct for all
cosmic time t, not just its present value t_0. Therefore models such as
LambdaCDM would be incomplete because they ascribe the cosmic expansion to
variable conditions not consistent with this relativistic constraint. We show
that this may be the reason why the observed galaxy correlation function is not
consistent with the predictions of the standard model. We suggest that an
R_h=ct universe is easily distinguishable from all other models at large
redshift (i.e., in the early universe), where the latter all predict a rapid
deceleration.

significant photon bunches in GRB 090510A, possibly classic GRB pulses, are
remarkably brief, an order of magnitude shorter in duration than any previously
claimed temporal feature in this energy range. Although conceivably a $>3
\sigma$ fluctuation, when taken at face value, these pulses lead to an order of
magnitude tightening of prior limits on photon dispersion. Bound of $\Delta c /

where the time delay is proportional to the photon energy to the first or

Lima et al. 2008 and Cunha et al. 2009 to derive the ensemble redshift
distribution N(z), and individual redshift probability distributions P(z) for
galaxies with r < 21.8. As part of this technique, we calculated weights for a
set of training galaxies with known redshifts such that their density
distribution in five dimensional color-magnitude space was proportional to that
of the photometry-only sample, producing a nearly fair sample in that space. We
then estimated the ensemble N(z) of the photometric sample by constructing a
weighted histogram of the training set redshifts. We derived P(z) s for
individual objects using the same technique, but limiting to training set
objects from the local color-magnitude space around each photometric object.
Using the P(z) for each galaxy, rather than an ensemble N(z), can reduce the
statistical error in measurements that depend on the redshifts of individual
galaxies. The spectroscopic training sample is substantially larger than that
used for the DR7 release, and the newly added PRIMUS catalog is now the most
important training set used in this analysis by a wide margin. We expect the
primary source of error in the N(z) reconstruction is sample variance: the
training sets are drawn from relatively small volumes of space. Using
simulations we estimated the uncertainty in N(z) at a given redshift is 10-15%.
The uncertainty on calculations incorporating N(z) or P(z) depends on how they

the 197 known zeolite frameworks exhibit an extensive flexibility, where the
number of unique mechanisms increases linearly with the volume when long
wavelength mechanisms are included. Extensively flexible frameworks therefore
have a maximum in configurational entropy, as large crystals, at their lowest

that surface and edge mechanisms are important, likely during the nucleation

in addition to low framework energy, it is an important criterion when

desirable if OPF can be solved very efficiently so its solution can be used in
real time. With some special network structure, e.g. trees, the problem has
been shown to have a zero duality gap and the convex dual problem yields the
optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a primal and a dual algorithm to
coordinate the smaller subproblems decomposed from the convexified OPF. We can
arrange the subproblems to be solved sequentially and cumulatively in a central
node or solved in parallel in distributed nodes. We test the algorithms on IEEE
radial distribution test feeders, some random tree-structured networks, and the
IEEE transmission system benchmarks. Simulation results show that the
computation time can be improved dramatically with our algorithms over the
centralized approach of solving the problem without decomposition, especially
in tree-structured problems. The computation time grows linearly with the
problem size with the cumulative approach while the distributed one can have
size-independent computation time.

is noise tolerant if the classifiers learnt with the ideal noise-free data and
with noisy data, both have the same classification accuracy on the noise-free

minimization (under different loss functions), which is a generic method for
learning classifiers. We show that risk minimization under 0-1 loss function
has impressive noise tolerance properties and that under squared error loss is
tolerant only to uniform noise; risk minimization under other loss functions is
not noise tolerant. We conclude the paper with some discussion on implications

$1.3\times 10^{12}$ at/cm$^3$ (within a factor of 2) and the phase-space
density increase over the uncooled sample is 20. Numerical simulations indicate
that temperatures below the single photon recoil temperature should be
achievable with this method.

paramagnetic resonance studies of KTa_{0.998}Nb_{0.012}O_{3} crystals. The
corresponding microwave X-band spectrum at T < 10 K consists of a narrow,
nearly isotropic signal located at g ~ 2 and a strongly anisotropic component.
The first signal, which has a rich structure due to hyperfine interactions with
the lattice nuclei, is attributed to the single trapped charge carriers: the
electrons and/or the holes. The anisotropic spectrum is caused by the axial
centers oriented along the C_{4} pseudo-cubic principal crystalline axes. The
spectrum angular dependence can be described well by an axial center with S =
1, g_{\parallel) = 0.82, g_{\perp} = 0.52 and D = 0.44 cm^{-1}. The anisotropic
spectrum is attributed to the Nb^{4+}-O^{-} polaronic excitons. The temperature
dependence of the anisotropic component is characterized by two activation
energies: the internal dynamics activation E_{a1} = 3.7\pm0.5 meV, which makes
the EPR spectrum unobservable above 10 K, and the destruction energy E_{a2} =
52\pm4 meV. By comparing the anisotropic photo-EPR spectrum and the
photoinduced optical absorption temperature dependencies, we found that the
Nb^{4+}-O^{-} polaronic excitons also manifested themselves via the ~0.7 eV
wide absorption band arising under UV light excitation in the weakly

classical work of Hyman Bass and Michael Stein that for classical groups Gauss
decomposition holds under weaker assumptions such as $\sr(R)=1$ or $\asr(R)=1$.
Later the second author noticed that condition $\sr(R)=1$ is necessary for
Gauss decomposition. Here, we show that a slight variation of Tavgen's rank
reduction theorem implies that for the elementary group $E(\Phi,R)$ condition
$\sr(R)=1$ is also sufficient for Gauss decomposition. In other words,
$E=HUU^-U$, where $H=H(\Phi,R)=T\cap E$. This surprising result shows that
stronger conditions on the ground ring, such as being semi-local, $\asr(R)=1$,
$\sr(R,\Lambda)=1$, etc., were only needed to guarantee that for simply

almost scale-invariant primordial power spectrum. Such oscillations are
predicted by a variety of models, some of which amount to assuming there is
some non-trivial choice of the vacuum state at the onset of inflation. In this
paper we will explore data-driven constraints on two distinct models of initial
state modifications. In both models the frequency, phase and amplitude are
degrees of freedom of the theory for which the theoretical bounds are rather
weak: both the amplitude and frequency have allowed values ranging over several
orders of magnitude. This requires many computationally expensive evaluations
of the model CMB spectra and their goodness-of-fit, even in a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC), normally the most efficient fitting method for such a
problem. To search more efficiently we first run a densely spaced grid, with
only 3 varying parameters; the frequency, the amplitude and the baryon density.
We obtain the optimal frequency and run an MCMC at the best fit frequency,
randomly varying all other relevant parameters. To reduce the computational
time of each power spectrum computation, we adjust both comoving momentum
integration and spline interpolation (in l) as a function of frequency and
amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. Applying this to the WMAP 7 data
allows us to improve existing constraints on the presence of oscillations. We
confirm earlier findings that certain frequencies can improve the fitting over
a model without oscillations. For those frequencies we compute the posterior
probability, allowing us to put some constraints on the primordial parameter
space of both models.

attitude in terms of a specified amount of caution, thereby enabling data
analysis at the level of caution desired and on the basis of any prior

inferences are based only on the corresponding physical posterior. In those

inferences do not depend on the degree of caution. Partial prior information
between those two extremes leads to intermediate inferences that are more

phenomenon affects the size and shape of a cloud of spin-$\half$ fermions
trapped in a harmonic potential such as those used in cold atom experiments. We
develop an adiabatic formulation, including the concomitant Pancharatnam-Berry
phase effects, for the one particle states in the presence of a trapping
potential and the gauge field, obtaining approximate analytical formulae for
the energy levels for some high symmetry gauge field configurations of
interest. An analysis based on the local density approximation reveals that,
for a given number of particles, the cloud shrinks in a {\em characteristic
fashion with increasing $\lambda$}. For an isotropic harmonic trap, the local
density approximation predicts a spherical cloud for all gauge field
configurations, which are anisotropic in general. We show, via a calculation of
the cloud shape using exact eigenstates, that for certain gauge field
configurations there is systematic and observable anisotropy in the cloud shape
that increases with increasing gauge coupling $\lambda$. These results should
be useful in the design of cold atom experiments with fermions in non-Abelian

finite word have the same value. In this paper, we investigate functional
weighted automata for four different measures: the sum, the mean, the
discounted sum of weights along edges and the ratio between rewards and costs.
On the positive side, we show that functionality is decidable for the four
measures. Furthermore, the existential and universal threshold problems, the
language inclusion problem and the equivalence problem are all decidable when
the weighted automata are functional. On the negative side, we also study the
quantitative extension of the realizability problem and show that it is
undecidable for sum, mean and ratio. We finally show how to decide whether the
language associated with a given functional automaton can be defined with a
deterministic one, for sum, mean and discounted sum. The results on
functionality and determinizability are expressed for the more general class of
functional group automata. This allows one to formulate within the same
framework new results related to discounted sum automata and known results on
sum and mean automata. Ratio automata do not fit within this general scheme and
different techniques are required to decide functionality.
