non-compressed, parallel granular chains subject to a local initial impulse.
The motion of the granules in each chain is constrained to be in one direction
which coincides with the orientation of the chain. We show that in spite of the
fact that the applied impulse is applied to a one of the granular chains, the
resulting pulse that initially propagating only in the excited chain gets
gradually equi-partitioned between its neighboring chains, and eventually in
all chains of the array. In particular, the initially strongly localized state
of energy distribution evolves towards a final stationary state of formation of
identical solitary waves that propagate in each one of the chains. These
solitary waves are synchronized and have identical speeds. We show that the
phenomenon of primary pulse equi-partition between the weakly coupled granular
chains can be fully reproduced in coupled binary models which constitute a
significantly simpler model that captures the main qualitative features of the
dynamics of the granular array. The results reported herein are of major
practical significance, since it indicates that the weakly coupled array of
granular chains is a medium in which an initially localized excitation gets
gradually defocused, resulting in drastic reduction of propagating pulses as
they are equi-partitioned among all chains.

fitness. However, each study tends to focus on a particular problem, leaving
unclear the overall structure of variability in populations. This fractured
conceptual framework often causes particular applications to be incomplete or
improperly analyzed. In this paper, I present a concise introduction to the two
key aspects of the theory. First, all measures of fitness ultimately arise from
the relative comparison of the reproductive success of individuals or genotypes
with the average reproductive success in the population. That relative measure
creates a diminishing relation between reproductive success and fitness.
Diminishing returns reduce fitness in proportion to variability in reproductive
success. The relative measurement of success also induces a frequency
dependence that favors rare types. Second, variability in populations has a
hierarchical structure. Variable success in different traits of an individual
affects that individual's variation in reproduction. Correlation between
different individuals' reproduction affects variation in the aggregate success
of particular alleles across the population. One must consider the hierarchical
structure of variability in relation to different consequences of temporal,
spatial, and developmental variability. Although a complete analysis of
variability has many separate parts, this simple framework allows one to see
the structure of the whole and to place particular problems in their proper
relation to the general theory. The biological understanding of relative
success and the hierarchical structure of variability in populations may also
contribute to a deeper economic theory of returns under uncertainty.

classical view, several theories have emphasized that developmental variability

accelerate evolutionary response. In this paper, I show how developmental
variability alters evolutionary dynamics by smoothing the landscape that
relates genotype to fitness. In a fitness landscape with multiple peaks and
valleys, developmental variability can smooth the landscape to provide a
directly increasing path of fitness to the highest peak. Developmental
variability also allows initial survival of a genotype in response to novel or
extreme environmental challenge, providing an opportunity for subsequent
adaptation. This initial survival advantage arises from the way in which
developmental variability smooths and broadens the fitness landscape.
Ultimately, the synergism between developmental processes and genetic variation
sets evolutionary rate.

estimates the set of defective sensors from a small number of linearly

algorithm uses a low complexity distance decoder that is robust to noisy

determine the minimal number of linearly independent messages needed for

study to the detection of multiple defective sensors by modifying appropriately

equivalent of the Lifshitz transition in strongly anisotropic metamaterials.
When one of the components of the dielectric permittivity tensor of such a
composite changes sign, the corresponding iso-frequency surface transforms from
an ellipsoid to a hyperboloid. Since the photonic density of states can be
related to the volume enclosed by the iso-frequency surface, such a topological
transition in a metamaterial leads to a dramatic change in the photonic density

electromagnetic energy to the nonlinear optical response to
quantum-electrodynamic effects such as spontaneous emission. In the present
paper, we demonstrate the modification of spontaneous light emission from
quantum dots placed near the surface of the metamaterial undergoing the

with a minimal match $\MMm=0.99$, we find that the selected RB waveforms are
able to represent {\em any} QNM, including those not in the original bank, with
extremely high accuracy, typically less than $10^{-13}$. We then extend our
studies to two-mode QNMs. Inclusion of a second mode is expected to help with
detection, and might make it possible to infer details of the progenitor of the
final black hole. We find that the number of RB waveforms needed to represent
any two-mode ringdown waveform with the above high accuracy is {\em smaller}
than the number of metric-based, one-mode templates with $\MMm=0.99$. For
unconstrained two-modes, which would allow for consistency tests of General
Relativity, our high accuracy RB has around $10^4$ {\em fewer} waveforms than
the number of metric-based templates for $\MMm=0.99$. The number of RB elements
grows only linearly with the number of multipole modes versus exponentially
with the standard approach, resulting in very compact representations even for
many multiple modes. The results of this paper open the possibility of searches
of multi-mode ringdown gravitational waves.

stochastic optimization problems which arise in machine learning. For strongly
convex problems, its convergence rate was known to be O(\log(T)/T), by running
SGD for T iterations and returning the average point. However, recent results
showed that using a different algorithm, one can get an optimal O(1/T) rate.
This might lead one to believe that standard SGD is suboptimal, and maybe
should even be replaced as a method of choice. In this paper, we investigate
the optimality of SGD in a stochastic setting. We show that for smooth
problems, the algorithm attains the optimal O(1/T) rate. However, for
non-smooth problems, the convergence rate with averaging might really be
\Omega(\log(T)/T), and this is not just an artifact of the analysis. On the
flip side, we show that a simple modification of the averaging step suffices to
recover the O(1/T) rate, and no other change of the algorithm is necessary. We
also present experimental results which support our findings, and point out
open problems.

The general relativistic Godel-Obukhov spacetime metric which incorporates
expansion and rotation of the Universe is used to evaluate this force. This
metric is expressed here in spherical comoving coordinates. Through a cosmic
time evolution, it is shown that cosmic acceleration is expected when the
magnitude of the radial repulsive GM force exceeds that of the familiar or
usual attractive gravitational ""gravitoelectric"" (GE) force: associated with
just cosmic matter and spacetime warping (or curvature). In general, this
phenomenon of cosmic accelerated expansion appears to have occurred twice in
the history of the Universe: the inflationary phase and the present-day
acceleration phase. It is suggested in this model that the two phases may or
may not be related. The cosmological model presented here is described in the
context of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity in Riemann-Cartan spacetime
(the ""generalized"" Einstein- Cartan theory of gravity), which includes cosmic
rotation, its effect of spacetime torsion, and it being considered as an
intrinsic part of gravity. Also, an associated derived analytical expression
for the cosmic primordial magnetic field is presented. Evolving this magnetic
field over cosmic time shows it to be consistent with theory and observations.
In addition, it appears that the spin density of cosmic matter couples this
magnetic field to the GM field, and also couples this magnetic field to the GE
field.

stellar chromospheres. Comparison with semiempirical solar flux models shows
that the most rapidly rotating solar-mass stars have FUV continuum brightness

threshold, the system undergoes a Type-I transition, characterized by an
attractor bifurcation. The bifurcated attractor is an (m-1)-dimensional
homological sphere where m is the multiplicity of the first critical
eigenvalue. When m=1, the structure of this attractor is trivial. When m=2, it
is known that the bifurcated attractor consists of steady states and their
connecting heteroclinic orbits. The main focus of this article is then on the
pattern selection mechanism and stability of rolls, rectangles and mixed modes
(including hexagons) for the case where m=2. We derive in particular a complete
classification of all transition scenarios, determining the patterns of the
bifurcated steady states, their stabilities and the basin of attraction of the
stable ones. The theoretical results lead to interesting physical conclusions,
which are in agreement with known experimental results. For example, it is

construct a TQFT-like theory that, in addition to giving the aforementioned
obstructions, yield structural information about invariants of Legendrian
submanifolds. For example, the obstructions devised in this paper show that
there is no generating family compatible Lagrangian cobordism between the
Chekanov-Eliashberg Legendrian $m(5_2)$ knots. Further, the generating family
cohomology groups of a Legendrian submanifold restrict the topology of a
Lagrangian filling. Structurally, the generating family cohomology of a
Legendrian submanifold satisfies a type of Alexander duality that, when the
Legendrian is null-cobordant, can be seen as Poincar\'e duality of the
associated Lagrangian filling. This duality implies the Arnold Conjecture for
Legendrian submanifolds with linear-at-infinity generating families. The
results are obtained by developing a generating family version of wrapped Floer
cohomology and establishing long exact sequences that arise from viewing the
the spaces underlying these cohomology groups as mapping cones.

SEPs), accelerated at a reconnection site that is not magnetically connected to

Our model is based on the results of a low-beta resistive magnetohydrodynamics
simulation of a three-dimensional line-tied and initially current-free bipole,
that is embedded in a non-uniform open potential field. The topology of this
configuration is that of an asymmetric coronal null-point, with a closed fan
surface and an open outer spine. When driven by slow photospheric shearing
motions, field lines, initially fully anchored below the fan dome, reconnect at
the null point, and jump to the open magnetic domain. This is the standard
interchange mode as sketched and calculated in 2D. The key result in 3D is
that, reconnected open field lines located in the vicinity of the outer spine,
keep reconnecting continuously, across an open quasi-separatrix layer, as
previously identified for non-open-null-point reconnection. The apparent
slipping motion of these field lines leads to form an extended narrow magnetic
flux tube at high altitude. Because of the slip-running reconnection, we
conjecture that if energetic particles would be traveling through, or be
accelerated inside, the diffusion region, they would be successively injected
along continuously reconnecting field lines that are connected farther and
farther from the spine. At the scale of the full Sun, owing to the super-radial
expansion of field lines below 3 solar radii, such energetic particles could
easily be injected in field lines slipping over significant distances, and
could eventually reach the distant flux tube that is well-connected to the
Earth.

Internet traffic. Examples include P2P systems for network storage, web

systems supporting virtual organizations have given rise to a new category of
P2P systems called schema-based. In such systems each peer exposes its own
schema and the main objective is the efficient search across the P2P network by
processing each incoming query without overly consuming bandwidth. The
usability of these systems depends on effective techniques to find and retrieve
data; however, efficient and effective routing of content-based queries is a
challenging problem in P2P networks. This work was attended as an attempt to
motivate the use of mining algorithms and hypergraphs context to develop two
different methods that improve significantly the efficiency of P2P
communications. The proposed query routing methods direct the query to a set of
relevant peers in such way as to avoid network traffic and bandwidth
consumption. We compare the performance of the two proposed methods with the

must decrease steeply in the low-energy domain, and its energy dependence must
depart from a simple power law. We construct illustrative models that satisfy
these conditions, by introducing Lorentz violation in a sector with light

problem of Aldous and Fill and also generalizes results of Cox for discrete
tori in $d\geq2$ dimensions. Other results apply to nonreversible walks and
also generalize previous theorems of Durrett and Cooper et al. Slight
extensions of these results apply to voter model consensus times, which are
related to coalescing random walks via duality. Our main proof ideas are a
strengthening of the usual approximation of hitting times by exponential random
variables, which give results for nonstationary initial states; and a new
general set of conditions under which we can prove that the hitting time of a
union of sets behaves like a minimum of independent exponentials. In
particular, this will show that the first meeting time among $k$ random walkers
has mean $\approx\mathsf{m}(G)/\bigl({\matrix{k 2}}\bigr)$.

an environmental effect characteristic of the local neighborhood of our planet,
without the need of violation of the Poincar\'e-invariance at a fundamental
level. This explanation requires the existence of a new spin-2 field of a
planetary Compton wave-length that is coupled to neutrinos and the rest of the
matter asymmetrically, both in the magnitude and in the sign. Sourced by the
earth this field creates an effective metric on which neutrinos propagate
superluminally, whereas other species are much less sensitive to the
background. Such a setup, at an effective field theory level, passes all
immediate phenomenological tests and its natural prediction is an inevitable
appearance of a testable long-range gravity-type fifth force. We then prove
that under the assumption of the weakly-coupled Poincar\'e-invariant physics,
the asymmetrically-coupled second massive graviton is the only possible
environmental explanation. Despite phenomenological viability, the sign
asymmetry of the coupling we identify as the main potential obstacle for a
consistent UV-completion. We also discuss the possible identification of this
field with a Kaluza-Klein state of an extra dimension in which neutrino can
propagate.

the biases in the cosmological parameter constraints from weak lensing and
derive requirements on the spectroscopic follow-up for three different photo-z

that sample variance is much more relevant for the photo-z error calibration
than for photo-z training, implying that follow-up requirements are similar for

for training of photo-zs and error calibration without incurring additional
bias in the cosmological parameters. We provide a guide for observing proposals
for the spectroscopic follow-up to ensure that redshift calibration biases do
not dominate the cosmological parameter error budget. For example, assuming
optimistically (pessimistically) that the weak lensing shear measurements from
the Dark Energy Survey could obtain 1-sigma constraints on the dark energy
equation of state w of 0.035 (0.055), implies a follow-up requirement of 150

VVDS-like spectroscopic completeness with purely random failures, this could be
accomplished with about 75 (20) nights of observation. For more realistic
assumptions regarding spectroscopic completeness, or in the presence of other
sources of systematics not considered here, further degradations to dark energy
constraints are possible. We test several approaches for reducing the

exceptionally strong PaBeta emission (EW=-11.4 +/- 0.3 A) which signals the
presence of a circumplanetary accretion disk. The luminosity of GSC 06214-00210
b combined with its age yields a model-dependent mass of 14 +/- 2 MJup, making
it the lowest-mass companion to show evidence of a disk. With a projected
separation of 320 AU, the formation of GSC 06214-00210 b and other very
low-mass companions on similarly wide orbits is unclear. One proposed mechanism
is formation at close separations followed by planet-planet scattering to much
larger orbits. Since that scenario involves a close encounter with another
massive body, which is probably destructive to circumplanetary disks, it is
unlikely that GSC 06214-00210 b underwent a scattering event in the past. This
implies that planet-planet scattering is not solely responsible for the
population of gas giants on wide orbits. More generally, the identification of
disks around young planetary companions on wide orbits offers a novel method to
constrain the formation pathway of these objects, which is otherwise
notoriously difficult to do for individual systems. We also refine the spectral

we have addressed the issue of the degeneracy between the effects of the

how the redshift evolution of the linear amplitude or the scale dependence of
the nonlinear power spectrum might provide a way to break the degeneracy. For
the latter, instead, we have computed the redshift and scale dependence of the

low luminosities (MV = -9). With this expanded sample, we find no correlation
between size and luminosity, in contrast to previous suggestions, and no
general correlation between size and galactocentric distance. We explore the
relationships between UCDs, less luminous extended clusters (including faint
fuzzies), globular clusters (GCs), as well as early-type galaxies and their
nuclei, assembling an extensive new catalog of sizes and luminosities for
stellar systems. Most of the M87 UCDs follow a tight color-magnitude relation,
offset from the metal-poor GCs. This, along with kinematical differences,
demonstrates that most UCDs are a distinct population from normal GCs, and not
simply a continuation to larger sizes and higher luminosities. The UCD
color-magnitude trend couples closely with that for Virgo dwarf elliptical
nuclei. We conclude that the M87 UCDs are predominantly stripped nuclei. The
brightest and reddest UCDs may be the remnant nuclei of more massive galaxies
while a subset of the faintest UCDs may be tidally limited and related to more
compact star clusters. In the broader context of galaxy assembly, blue UCDs may
trace halo build-up by accretion of low-mass satellites, while red UCDs may be
markers of metal-rich bulge formation in larger galaxies.

that has not gone through an accretion shock near the virial radius and that
this cold gas flows towards the central galaxy along dense filaments and
streams. There is, however, little observational evidence for the existence of
these cold flows. We use a large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation that
has been post-processed with radiative transfer to study the contribution of
cold flows to the observed z=3 column density distribution of neutral hydrogen,
which our simulation reproduces. We find that nearly all of the HI absorption
arises in gas that has remained colder than 10^5.5 K, at least while it was
extragalactic. In addition, the majority of the HI is rapidly falling towards a
nearby galaxy, with non-negligible contributions from outflowing and static
gas. Above a column density of N_HI = 10^17 cm^-2, most of the absorbers reside
inside haloes, but the interstellar medium only dominates for N_HI > 10^21
cm^-2. Haloes with total mass below 10^10 Msun dominate the absorption for
10^17<N_HI < 10^21 cm^-2, but the average halo mass increases sharply for
higher column densities. Although very little of the HI in absorbers with N_HI
<~ 10^20 cm^-2 resides inside galaxies, systems with N_HI > 10^17 cm^-2 are
closely related to star formation: most of their HI either will become part of
the interstellar medium before z=2 or has been ejected from a galaxy at z>3.
Cold accretion flows are critical for the success of our simulation in
reproducing the observed rate of incidence of damped Lyman-alpha and
particularly that of Lyman limit systems. We therefore conclude that cold
accretion flows exist and have already been detected in the form of high column
density HI absorbers.

low temperatures the inverse compressibility decreases first with increasing
temperature, but after reaching a minimum it increases as temperature is raised
further. At high enough temperatures the negative compressibility of low
density systems induced by the exchange energy becomes positive due to the
dominance of the finite temperature kinetic energy. The inverse compressibility
in monolayer graphene is always positive and its temperature dependence appears
to be reverse of the 2D semiconductor systems, i.e., it increases first with
temperature and then decreases at high temperatures. The inverse
compressibility of bilayer graphene shows the same non-monotonic behavior as
ordinary 2D systems, but at high temperatures it approaches a constant which is
smaller than the value of the non-interacting bilayer graphene. We find the
leading order temperature correction to the compressibility within Hartree-Fock

Carlo simulations on an effective classical XY model. The ground state at
intermediate correlations is consistently shown to be a chiral Mott insulator
(CMI) with a gap to all excitations and staggered loop currents which
spontaneously break time reversal symmetry. We characterize the CMI state as a
vortex supersolid or an indirect exciton condensate, and discuss various

Sun and the solar system, and only slightly higher than the primordial 3He
abundance as predicted by the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, the
classical theory of stellar evolution predicts a high production of 3He by
low-mass stars, implying a strong increase of 3He with time in the Galaxy. This
is the well-known ""3He problem"". Aims. We study the effects of thermohaline and
rotation-induced mixings on the production and destruction of 3He over the
lifetime of low- and intermediate-mass stars at various metallicities. Methods.
We compute stellar evolutionary models in the mass range 1 to 6M\odot for four
metallicities, taking into account thermohaline instability and
rotation-induced mixing. For the thermohaline diffusivity we use the
prescription based on the linear stability analysis, which reproduces Red Giant
Branch (RGB) abundance patterns at all metallicities. Rotation-induced mixing
is treated taking into account meridional circulation and shear turbulence. We
discuss the effects of these processes on internal and surface abundances of
3He and on the net yields. Results. Over the whole mass and metallicity range
investigated, rotation-induced mixing lowers the 3He production, as well as the
upper mass limit at which stars destroy 3He. For low-mass stars, thermohaline
mixing occuring beyond the RGB bump is the dominant process in strongly
reducing the net 3He yield compared to standard computations. Yet these stars
remain net 3He producers. Conclusions. Overall, the net 3He yields are strongly
reduced compared to the standard framework predictions.

major challenge of multi-agent systems research. To address this, many
researchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions
based on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically
learnt using some form of machine learning algorithm. Nevertheless, many of
these approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary
information is made available so that the estimates can be learnt. To this end,
we argue that cooperative communication of state information between agents is
one such mechanism. However, in a dynamically changing environment, the
accuracy and timeliness of this communicated information determine the fidelity
of the learned estimates and the usefulness of the actions taken based on
these. Given this, we propose a novel information-sharing protocol,
post-task-completion sharing, for the distribution of state information. We
then show, through a formal analysis, the improvement in the quality of
estimates produced using our strategy over the widely used protocol of sharing
information between nearest neighbours. Moreover, communication heuristics
designed around our information-sharing principle are subjected to empirical
evaluation along with other benchmark strategies (including Littmans Q-routing
and Stones TPOT-RL) in a simulated call-routing application. These studies,
conducted across a range of environmental settings, show that, compared to the
different benchmarks used, our strategy generates an improvement of up to 60%
in the call connection rate; of more than 1000% in the ability to connect
long-distance calls; and incurs as low as 0.25 of the message overhead.

  685-758, 2005","10.1613/jair.1747",,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Between 1998 and 2004, the planning community has seen vast progress in terms
of the sizes of benchmark examples that domain-independent planners can tackle
successfully. The key technique behind this progress is the use of heuristic
functions based on relaxing the planning task at hand, where the relaxation is
to assume that all delete lists are empty. The unprecedented success of such
methods, in many commonly used benchmark examples, calls for an understanding
of what classes of domains these methods are well suited for. In the
investigation at hand, we derive a formal background to such an understanding.
We perform a case study covering a range of 30 commonly used STRIPS and ADL
benchmark domains, including all examples used in the first four international
planning competitions. We *prove* connections between domain structure and
local search topology -- heuristic cost surface properties -- under an
idealized version of the heuristic functions used in modern planners. The
idealized heuristic function is called h^+, and differs from the practically
used functions in that it returns the length of an *optimal* relaxed plan,
which is NP-hard to compute. We identify several key characteristics of the
topology under h^+, concerning the existence/non-existence of unrecognized dead
ends, as well as the existence/non-existence of constant upper bounds on the
difficulty of escaping local minima and benches. These distinctions divide the
(set of all) planning domains into a taxonomy of classes of varying h^+
topology. As it turns out, many of the 30 investigated domains lie in classes
with a relatively easy topology. Most particularly, 12 of the domains lie in
classes where FFs search algorithm, provided with h^+, is a polynomial solving
mechanism. We also present results relating h^+ to its approximation as
implemented in FF. The behavior regarding dead ends is provably the same. We
summarize the results of an empirical investigation showing that, in many
domains, the topological qualities of h^+ are largely inherited by the
approximation. The overall investigation gives a rare example of a successful
analysis of the connections between typical-case problem structure, and search
performance. The theoretical investigation also gives hints on how the
topological phenomena might be automatically recognizable by domain analysis
techniques. We outline some preliminary steps we made into that direction.

applicability of the latter approach. We demonstrate that the use of standard
techniques for binary CSPs in the encodings of non-binary problems is
problematic and results in models that are very rarely competitive with the
non-binary representation. To overcome this, we propose specialized arc
consistency and search algorithms for binary encodings, and we evaluate them
theoretically and empirically. We consider three binary representations; the
hidden variable encoding, the dual encoding, and the double encoding.
Theoretical and empirical results show that, for certain classes of non-binary
constraints, binary encodings are a competitive option, and in many cases, a
better one than the non-binary representation.

spectral parameters up to 18 days from the onset of the outburst. The
broad-band (0.5-100 keV) spectrum of the source could be reasonably well
described by using an absorbed power-law component with a high energy cut-off
(N_H\simeq0.8x10^(22) cm^(-2), {\Gamma}\simeq0.7-1.0, and E_cut\simeq25 keV)
and displayed some evidence of a soft component below \sim2 keV. No coherent
timing features were found in the RXTE data. The ATCA observation did not
detect significant radio emission from IGRJ17361-4441, and provided the most
stringent upper limit (rms 14.1 {\mu}Jy at 5.5 GHz) to date on the presence of
any radio source close to the NGC6388 center of gravity. The improved position
of IGRJ17361-4441 in outburst determined from a recent target of opportunity
observation with Chandra, together with the X-ray flux and radio upper limits
measured in the direction of the source, argue against its association with the
putative intermediate-mass black hole residing in the globular cluster and with
the general hypothesis that the INTEGRAL source is a black hole candidate.
IGRJ17361-4441 might be more likely a new X-ray binary hosting an accreting

limit to the mass of the suspected intermediate massive black hole in NGC6388
of <600 M\odot. This is a factor of 2.5 lower than the limit reported

  submitted to JCAP",,"10.1088/1475-7516/2012/05/007",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect from instruments
such as the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) will soon put improved constraints on reionization. Popular models assume
that UV photons alone are responsible for reionization of the intergalactic
medium. We explore the effects of a significant contribution of X-rays to
reionization on the kSZ signal. Because X-rays have a large mean free path
through the neutral intergalactic medium, they introduce partial ionization in
between the sharp-edged bubbles created by UV photons. This smooth ionization
component changes the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature anisotropies. We quantify this effect by running semi-numerical
simulations of reionization. We test a number of different models of
reionization without X-rays that have varying physical parameters, but which
are constrained to have similar total optical depths to electron scattering.
These are then compared to models with varying levels of contribution to
reionization from X-rays. We find that models with more than a 10% contribution
from X-rays produce a significantly lower power spectrum of temperature
anisotropies than all the UV-only models tested. The expected sensitivity of
SPT and ACT may be insufficient to distinguish between our models, however, a
non-detection of the kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization could result
from the contribution of X-rays. It will be important for future missions with
improved sensitivity to consider the impact of X-ray sources on reionization.

between a 3+1 dimensional topological insulator and a metal or between a 3+1
dimensional topological insulator with residual bulk charge carriers and vacuum
have a polarization that is rotated by an angle of order of the fine structure
constant alpha compared to their topological trivial counterparts. In this work
we generalize this analysis to the more realistic case of thin films, taking
into account the effect of multiple reflections. In the symmetric case of a
thin film surrounded by the same material on both sides the polarization of
both allowed surface plasmon modes is unchanged from the single interface case,
even though their dispersion relation is altered by the interactions between
the two surface layers. In the general asymmetric case the angle is affected as
well. We give a simple analytic expression for the resonance condition that
determines the angle and solve it perturbatively for the case of a thin film

appropriate notion of limit for the spectrum of the quadrature as $N$ goes to
infinity, in the sense that the limit coincides with the spectrum of the

Generalizing the method developed by C. Voisin we non-conjecturally prove the

discriminant curve splits into two components of degree 2 and 3, and the
generalized Prymian can be described in terms of the Prymians P_2 and P_3

precise information about the induced action of the involution on the

entirely produced in the corona by hot and cool materials at 7-16 MK and 1-3
MK, respectively. At 345 GHz, there is an additional contribution from
chromospheric material at a few 10^4 K. These results, which may also apply to
other millimeter-submillimeter radio events, are not consistent with the

problems of 3D reconstruction, pose estimation and object classification, from
a single 2D image. In sharp contrast with state of the art methods that rely
primarily on 2D information and solve each of these three problems separately
or iteratively, we propose a mathematical framework that incorporates prior
""knowledge"" about the 3D shapes of different object classes and solves these
problems jointly and simultaneously, using a hypothesize-and-bound (H&B)
algorithm. In the proposed H&B algorithm one hypothesis is defined for each
possible pair [object class, object pose], and the algorithm selects the
hypothesis H that maximizes a function L(H) encoding how well each hypothesis
""explains"" the input image. To find this maximum efficiently, the function L(H)
is not evaluated exactly for each hypothesis H, but rather upper and lower
bounds for it are computed at a much lower cost. In order to obtain bounds for
L(H) that are tight yet inexpensive to compute, we extend the theory of shapes
described in [14] to handle projections of shapes. This extension allows us to
define a probabilistic relationship between the prior knowledge given in 3D and
the 2D input image. This relationship is derived from first principles and is
proven to be the only relationship having the properties that we intuitively
expect from a ""projection."" In addition to the efficiency and optimality
characteristics of H&B algorithms, the proposed framework has the desirable
property of integrating information in the 2D image with information in the 3D
prior to estimate the optimal reconstruction. While this article focuses
primarily on the problem mentioned above, we believe that the theory presented

their scalability and appropriateness for overhearing, an important task in
monitoring open multi-agent systems. Then, building on the insights gained, we
introduce a novel representation using Colored Petri nets that explicitly
represent legal joint conversation states and messages. This representation
approach offers significant improvements in scalability and is particularly
suitable for overhearing. Furthermore, we show that this new representation
offers a comprehensive coverage of all conversation features of FIPA

that the characteristic luminosity K* defined by a Shechter LF is consistent
with SAM predictions, which mimic well the evolution of K* in z>1 rich

stellar population synthesis model invoking passive evolution with a formation
redshift z~5 - consistent with the presence of an old red galaxy population
ubiquitous in rich clusters at z=1.5. We also see a small difference (\Delta
K*~0.5) between our clusters and studies of the field population at similar
redshifts, suggesting only a weak dependence of the luminous (L>L*) part of the
LF on environment. Turning to our HOD study, we find that within R_{500},
high-z clusters tend to host smaller numbers of galaxies to a magnitude K*+2
compared to their low-z counterparts. This behavior is also seen in the mock
samples and is relatively insensitive to the average mass of the cluster
haloes. In particular, we find significant correlations of the observed number

$N(M,z)=(53\pm1)(1+z)^{-0.61^{+0.18}_{-0.20}}(M/10^{14.3})^{0.86\pm0.05}$.

spectrum from galaxy surveys in the presence of non-trivial survey selection
functions. The estimators are often obtained from formalisms like FKP and PKL,
which rely on the assumption that the underlying field is Gaussian. The Monte
Carlo method is more accurate but involves the tedious process of running and
cross-correlating a large number of N-body simulations, in which the survey
volume is embedded. From 200 N-body simulations, we extract a non-linear
covariance matrix as a function of two scales and of the angle between two
Fourier modes. All the non-Gaussian features of that matrix are then simply
parametrized in terms of a few fitting functions and Eigenvectors. We
furthermore develop a fast and accurate strategy that combines our
parameterization with a general galaxy survey selection function, and incor-
porate non-Gaussian Poisson uncertainty. We describe how to incorporate these
two distinct non-Gaussian contributions into a typical analysis pipeline, and
apply our method with the se- lection function from the 2dFGRS. We find that
the observed Fourier modes correlate at much larger scales than that predicted
by both FKP formalism or by pure N-body simulation in a ""top hat"" selection
function. In particular, the observed Fourier modes are already 50 per cent
correlated at k\sim0.1hMpc^(-1), and the non-Gaussian fractional variance on
the power spectrum ({\sigma} /P(k))^2 is about a factor of 3.0 larger than the
FKP prescription. At k~0.4hMpc^(-1), the deviations are an order of magnitude.

planning are defined by a parameterized relaxation of the optimal cost function
in the regression search space, where the parameter m offers a trade-off
between the accuracy and computational cost of theheuristic. Existing methods
for computing the hm heuristic require time exponential in m, limiting them to
small values (m andlt= 2). The hm heuristic can also be viewed as the optimal
cost function in a relaxation of the search space: this paper presents relaxed
search, a method for computing this function partially by searching in the
relaxed space. The relaxed search method, because it computes hm only
partially, is computationally cheaper and therefore usable for higher values of
m. The (complete) hm heuristic is combined with partial hm heuristics, for m =
3,..., computed by relaxed search, resulting in a more accurate heuristic.
  This use of the relaxed search method to improve on the hm heuristic is
evaluated by comparing two optimal temporal planners: TP4, which does not use
it, and HSP*a, which uses it but is otherwise identical to TP4. The comparison
is made on the domains used in the 2004 International Planning Competition, in
which both planners participated. Relaxed search is found to be cost effective
in some of these domains, but not all. Analysis reveals a characterization of
the domains in which relaxed search can be expected to be cost effective, in
terms of two measures on the original and relaxed search spaces. In the domains
where relaxed search is cost effective, expanding small states is
computationally cheaper than expanding large states and small states tend to
have small successor states.

to nearby samples using the same methods and find no evolution in the early
part of the lightcurve of SNe Ia up to z=1. We search for variations among
different populations, particularly subluminous objects, by dividing the sample
in stretch. Bright and slow decliners (s>1.0) have consistent stretch-corrected
rise-times compared to fainter and faster decliners (0.8<s<1.0); they are
shorter by 0.57^{+0.47}_{-0.50} (stat) days. Subluminous SNe Ia (here defined
as objects with s<0.8), although less constrained, are also consistent, with a
rise-time of 18.03^{+0.81}_{-1.37} (stat) days. We study several systematic
biases and find that the use of different fiducial templates may affect the
average rise-time but not the intrinsic differences between populations. Based
on our results, we estimate that subluminous SNe Ia are powered by 0.05-0.35
solar masses of radioactive nickel synthesized in the explosion. Our

flavors are produced due to the transit magnetic moment coupling. We discuss
the correlations of flavors in pairs produced back-to-back in the center of

to the beam direction. We demonstrate that the flavor mixing angle can be

micrometer PPN IRAS 07134+1005 has been reported. Assuming that the CO J=3-2
line was optically thin, the mass-loss rate of the superwind in this PPN was
found to be at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than the typical range. In
order to obtain a more accurate mass-loss rate, we reexamine this data and
construct a radiative transfer model to compare with the data. Also, in order
to better resolve the superwind, we adopt a different weighting on the data to
obtain maps at higher resolution. Our result shows that the CO J=3-2 emission
is located slightly further away from the central source than the mid-IR
emission, probably because that the material is cooler in the outer part and
thus better traced by the CO emission. At lower resolution, however, the CO
emission appeared to be spatially coincident with the mid-IR emission. Our
model has two components, an inner ellipsoidal shell-like superwind with an
equatorial density enhancement and an outer spheroidal AGB wind. The thick
torus in previous model could be considered as the dense equatorial part of our
ellipsoidal superwind. With radiative transfer, our model reproduces more
observed features than previous model and obtains an averaged superwind
mass-loss rate of ~ 1.8 x 10^-5 solar mass per year, which is typical for a
superwind. The mass-loss rate in the equatorial plane is 3 x 10^-5 solar mass
per year, also the same as that derived before from modeling CO J=1-0 emission.

in our first paper (Wu et al., New J. Phys., 2010, 12, 105012), full quantum
dynamics and leading-order `classical' hopping kinetics are compared in the
seven-site Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein complex. The difference between
these two dynamic descriptions is due to higher-order quantum corrections. Two
thermal bath models, classical white noise (the Haken-Strobl-Reineker model)
and quantum Debye model, are considered. In the seven-site FMO model, we
observe that higher-order corrections lead to negligible changes in the
trapping time or in energy transfer efficiency around the optimal and
physiological conditions (2% in the HSR model and 0.1% in the quantum Debye
model for the initial site at BChl 1). However, using the concept of integrated
flux, we can identify significant differences in branching probabilities of the
energy transfer network between hopping kinetics and quantum dynamics (26% in
the HSR model and 32% in the quantum Debye model for the initial site at BChl
1). This observation indicates that the quantum coherence can significantly
change the distribution of energy transfer pathways in the flux network with
the efficiency nearly the same. The quantum-classical comparison of the average
trapping time with the removal of the bottleneck site, BChl 4, demonstrates the
robustness of the efficient energy transfer by the mechanism of multi-site
quantum coherence. To reconcile with the latest eight-site FMO model, the
quantum-classical comparison with the flux network analysis is summarized in
the appendix. The eight-site FMO model yields similar trapping time and network
structure as the seven-site FMO model but leads to a more disperse distribution

most of pure elemental metals at room temperature ranges. This is obtained, in
Drude formula, by replacing the electron density with the number density of
atoms n(atom), and the electron effective mass with true electron mass
multiplied by G. Here the relaxation time is assumed to be (h/2pi)/(kT) for all
metals (h is the Planck constant and k is the Boltzmann constant). The single
free parameter G is summed electron numbers in each atomic shell, e.g. G=5+1=6
for chromium(five 3d electrons and one 4s electron). In this paper, we find
that the above relaxation time can be reproduced if the autocorrelation time of
electron fluctuating velocity in a simple fluctuation dissipation theorem is
converted to 2delta(energy)delta(time)/kT, and if this delta(energy)delta(time)
is assumed equal to (h/2pi)/2 of the Heisenberg's minimum uncertainty. This
corresponds to the closest approach, or head-on colliisions. Independent from
this, we find that n(electron)=n(atom), is appropriate for the conductivity in
most elemental metals. In discussing the 5th power temperature dependence of
resistivity, we find that, besides the use of the Debye temperature unit, the
temperature unit defined by the ion plasma frequency times (h/2pi)/k is equally
acceptable. Here the ion plasma frequency is only depending on n(electron)

The construction of the $C^2$-adjusted system is straightforward. However, in
BSSN, there are two kinetic constraints and three algebraic constraints; thus,
the definition of $C^2$ is a matter of concern. By analyzing constraint
propagation equations, we conclude that $C^2$ should include all the
constraints, which is also confirmed numerically. By tuning the parameters, the
lifetime of the simulations can be increased as 2-10 times as longer than those
of the standard BSSN evolutions.

along the antiferromagnetic Brillouin-zone boundary in the low-temperature
magnetically ordered state. Measurements along the (1/2 1/2 L) and (H H 1/2-H)
reciprocal-space directions reveal deviations in the spin-wave dispersion from
the previously reported model. Broad asymmetric shape of the peaks in energy
signifies strong spin-wave damping by interactions with the particle-hole
continuum. Their energy width exhibits no evident anomalies as a function of
momentum along the (1/2 1/2 L) direction, which could be attributed to
Fermi-surface nesting effects, implying the absence of pronounced commensurate
nesting vectors at the magnetic zone boundary. In agreement with a previous
study, we find no signatures of the superconducting transition in the magnetic
excitation spectrum, such as a magnetic resonant mode or a superconducting spin
gap, either at the magnetic ordering wavevector (0 0 1/2) or at the zone
boundary. However, the low superconducting transition temperature in this
material still leaves the possibility of such features being weak and therefore
hidden below the incoherent background at energies ~0.1 meV, precluding their
detection by INS.

Vibrio harveyi using the clinostat-centrifuge system designed and developed

significantly higher for simulated microgravity and lunar and Martian

because the relative death rate is also higher for these gravities. Jovian

practical and theoretical interests. In recent years, major breakthroughs have
been made in a study of counting constraint satisfaction problems (or #CSPs).
In particular, a computational complexity classification of bounded-degree
#CSPs has been discovered for all degrees except for two, where the ""degree"" of
an input instance is the maximal number of times that each input variable
appears in a given set of constraints. Despite the efforts of recent studies,
however, a complexity classification of degree-2 #CSPs has eluded from our
understandings. This paper challenges this open problem and gives its partial
solution by applying two novel proof techniques--T_{2}-constructibility and
parametrized symmetrization--which are specifically designed to handle
""arbitrary"" constraints under randomized approximation-preserving reductions.
We partition entire constraints into four sets and we classify the
approximation complexity of all degree-2 #CSPs whose constraints are drawn from
two of the four sets into two categories: problems computable in
polynomial-time or problems that are at least as hard as #SAT. Our proof
exploits a close relationship between complex-weighted degree-2 #CSPs and
Holant problems, which are a natural generalization of complex-weighted #CSPs.

finite barrier (at positive energies) is a simple potential which is generally
missed out while discussing the one-dimensional potentials in the textbooks of
quantum mechanics. We show that these systems present interesting situations
wherein transmitivity $(T_b(E))$ of a finite barrier can be changed both
quantitatively and qualitatively by varying the depth or width of the well or
by changing the distance between the well and the barrier. Using delta (thin)
well near a delta (thin) barrier we show that the well induces energy
oscillations riding over $T_b(E)$ in the transmitivity $T(E)$ at both the
energies below and above the barrier. More generally we show that a thick well
separated from a thick barrier also gives rise to energy oscillations in
$T(E)$. A well joining a barrier discontinuously (a finite jump) reduces $T(E)$
(as compared to $T_b(E))$ over all energies. When the well and barrier are
joined continuously, $T(E)$ increases and then decreases at energies below the
barrier. At energy above the the barrier the changes are inappreciable. In
these two cases if we separate the well and the barrier by a distance, $T(E)$
again acquires oscillations. Paradoxically, it turns out that a distant well
induces more energy oscillations in $T(E)$ than when it is near the barrier.

Courcelle, which states that any graph problem definable in monadic
second-order logic with edge-set quantifications (i.e., MSO2 model-checking) is
decidable in linear time on any class of graphs of bounded tree-width.
Recently, Kreutzer and Tazari proved a corresponding complexity lower-bound -
that MSO2 model-checking is not even in XP wrt. the formula size as parameter
for graph classes that are subgraph-closed and whose tree-width is
poly-logarithmically unbounded. Of course, this is not an unconditional result
but holds modulo a certain complexity-theoretic assumption, namely, the
Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).
  In this paper we present a closely related result. We show that even MSO1
model-checking with a fixed set of vertex labels, but without edge-set
quantifications, is not in XP wrt. the formula size as parameter for graph
classes which are subgraph-closed and whose tree-width is poly-logarithmically
unbounded unless the non-uniform ETH fails. In comparison to Kreutzer and
Tazari; $(1)$ we use a stronger prerequisite, namely non-uniform instead of
uniform ETH, to avoid the effectiveness assumption and the construction of
certain obstructions used in their proofs; and $(2)$ we assume a different set
of problems to be efficiently decidable, namely MSO1-definable properties on
vertex labeled graphs instead of MSO2-definable properties on unlabeled graphs.
  Our result has an interesting consequence in the realm of digraph width
measures: Strengthening the recent result, we show that no subdigraph-monotone
measure can be ""algorithmically useful"", unless it is within a poly-logarithmic

the formation of an accretion disk. On the other hand, in the considered
conditions the Blanford-Znajek mechanism can be activated, thus powerful jets
can be launched in the direction of the rotation axis of the black hole.
Importantly, no observational signatures of accretion, as typically seen from
the thermal X-ray emission from the accretion disks, are expected in the
suggested scenario. Here, properties of the generated jet are studied
numerically in the framework of a 2D general relativity magnetohydrodynamical
approach. Due to the accumulation of the magnetic flux at the black hole
horizon, the jet power is expected to be modulated on a sub-second time-scale.
Although the intervals between jet active phases depend on the magnetic flux
escape from the black hole horizon (which can be modeled self-consistently only
using a 3D code), a general estimate of the averaged jet power is obtained. It
is expected that for the black hole rotation, expected in stellar binary system
(the dimensionless rotation parameter a=0.5), approximately 10% of the accreted
rest energy can be channeled into the jets. In the specific case of the
gamma-ray binary system LS 5039, the obtained jet luminosity can be responsible
for the observed GeV radiation if one invokes Doppler boosting, which can
enhanced the apparent flux from the system.

universal power law with logarithmic corrections. Nonetheless, it has been
suggested that the introduction of a small azimuthal disturbance induces a long

but remember the initial condition. In this work, we create non-axisymmetric
air cavities by driving a metal disc through an initially-quiescent water
surface and observe their subsequent gravity-induced collapse. The cavities are
characterized by azimuthal harmonic disturbances with a single mode number $m$
and amplitude $a_m$. For small initial distortion amplitude (1 or 2% of the
mean disc radius), the cavity walls oscillate linearly during collapse, with
nearly constant amplitude and increasing frequency. As the amplitude is
increased, higher harmonics are triggered in the oscillations and we observe
more complex pinch-off modes. For small amplitude disturbances we compare our
experimental results with the model for the amplitude of the oscillations by
Schmidt et al. (2009) and the model for the collapse of an axisymmetric

combining these two models we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of

photon index $\Gamma \sim 1.5-2.1$ in the range of 2-10 keV and a weak disk
component with temperature of $\sim 0.2$ keV. In this work, We revisit the
formation of such a cool, optically thick, geometrically thin disk in the most
inner region of black hole X-ray binaries at the low/hard state within the
context of disk accretion fed by condensation of hot corona. By taking into
account the cooling process associated with both Compton and conductive
processes in a corona, and the irradiation of the hot corona to the disk, we
calculate the structure of the corona. For viscosity parameter $\alpha=0.2$,
it's found that the inner disk can exist for accretion rate ranging from $\dot
M \sim 0.006-0.03 \dot M_{\rm Edd}$, over which the electron temperatures of
the corona are in the range of $1-5\times 10^9\ \rm K$ producing the hard X-ray
emission. We calculate the emergent spectra of the inner disk and corona for
different mass accretion rates. The effect of viscosity parameter $\alpha$ and
albedo $a$ ($a$ is defined as the energy ratio of reflected radiation from the
surface of the thin disk to incident radiation upon it from the corona) to the
emergent spectra are also presented. Our model is used to explain the recent
observations of GX 339-4 and Cyg X-1, in which the thin disk may exist at ISCO

contribute to the width: the Landau damping phenomenon and the break-up of a

absorption of a thermal gluon. In the paper, we investigate the relation
between the singlet-to-octet thermal break-up and the so-called
gluo-dissociation, a mechanism for quarkonium dissociation widely used in
phenomenological approaches. The gluo-dissociation thermal width is obtained by
convoluting the gluon thermal distribution with the cross section of a gluon

cross section that at leading order, but neglecting colour-octet effects, was
computed long ago by Bhanot and Peskin. We will, first, show that the effective

this, the original McEliece cryptosystem, based on Goppa codes, has encountered
limited interest in practical applications, partly because of some constraints
imposed by this very special class of codes. We have recently introduced a

estimating the trade-off between security and complexity, in such a way to give
a simple procedure for the system design.

scalar power spectrum fits the most recent CMB data rather well, certain
features in the spectrum are known to lead to a better fit to the data
(although, the statistical significance of such results remains an open issue).
In the inflationary scenario, one or more periods of deviations from slow roll
are necessary in order to generate features in the scalar perturbation
spectrum. Over the last couple of years, it has been recognized that such
deviations from slow roll inflation can also result in reasonably large
non-Gaussianities. The Starobinsky model involves the canonical scalar field
and consists of a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in the slope.
The change in the slope causes a brief period of departure from slow roll
which, in turn, results in a sharp rise in power, along with a burst of
oscillations in the scalar spectrum for modes that leave the Hubble radius just
before and during the period of fast roll. The hallmark of the Starobinsky
model is that it allows the scalar power spectrum to be evaluated analytically
in terms of the three parameters that describe the model. We evaluate the
bi-spectrum of the scalar perturbations in the Starobinsky model in the
equilateral limit. Remarkably, we find that, all the different contributions to
the the bi-spectrum too can be evaluated completely analytically. We show that
the quantity $\fnl$, which characterizes the extent of non-Gaussianity, can be
expressed purely in terms of the ratio of the two slopes on either side of the
discontinuity in the potential. Further, we find that, for certain values of
the parameters, $\fnl$ in the Starobinsky model can be as large as the mean
value that has been arrived at from the analysis of the recent CMB data.

questions remain, such as the site of gamma-ray production, the emission
mechanism, and the factors that govern the strength of the emission. Using data
from a high radio band, 37 GHz, uncontaminated by other radiation components
besides the jet emission, we study these questions with averaged flux densities
over the the first year of Fermi operations. We look for possible correlations
between the 100 MeV - 100 GeV band used by the Fermi satellite and 37 GHz radio
band observed at the Aalto University Metsahovi Radio Telescope, as well as for
differences between the gamma-ray emission of different AGN subsamples. We use
data averaged over the 1FGL period. Our sample includes 249 northern AGN,
including a complete sample of 68 northern AGN with a measured average flux
density exceeding 1 Jy. We find significant correlation between both the flux
densities and luminosities in gamma and radio bands. The Fermi luminosity is
inversely correlated with the peak frequency of the synchrotron component of
the AGN spectral energy distributions. We also calculate the gamma dominances,
defined as the ratio between the gamma and radio flux densities, and find an
indication that high-energy blazars are more gamma-dominated than low-energy
blazars. After studying the distributions of gamma and radio luminosities, it
is clear that BL Lacertae objects are different from quasars, with
significantly lower luminosities. It is unclear whether this is an intrinsic
difference, an effect of variable relativistic boosting across the synchrotron
peak frequency range, or the result of Fermi being more sensitive to hard
spectrum sources like BL Lacertae objects. Our results suggest that the gamma
radiation is produced co-spatially with the 37 GHz emission, i.e., in the jet.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. We focus on simple models of
modified gravity mediated by a massive scalar field coupled to both baryons and
cold dark matter. This captures the features of chameleon, symmetron, dilaton
and $f(R)$ models. We find that the CMB peaks can be affected in three
independent ways provided the Compton radius of the massive scalar is not
far-off the sound horizon at last scattering. When the coupling of the massive
scalar to Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is large, the anomalous growth of the CDM
perturbation inside the Compton radius induces a change in the peak amplitudes.
When the coupling to baryons is moderately large, the speed of sound is
modified and the peaks shifted to higher momenta. Finally when both couplings
are non-vanishing, a new contribution proportional to the Newton potential
appears in the Sachs-Wolfe temperature and increases the peak amplitudes. We
also show how, given any temporal evolution of the scalar field mass, one can
engineer a corresponding modified gravity model of the chameleon type. This
opens up the possibility of having independent constraints on modified gravity
from the CMB peaks and large scale structures at low redshifts.

locked onto grain surfaces and react with other species, thereby preventing the

existence of cosmic ray (CR) electrons and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters.
The physical mechanism generating radio halos is still heavily debated. We
critically discuss the proposed models for the radio halo emission and
highlight the weaknesses underlying each explanation. We present an idea how
the interplay of CR propagation and turbulent advection selects a bimodal
spatial CR distribution that is characteristic for the dynamical state of a
cluster. As a result, strongly turbulent, merging clusters should have a more
centrally concentrated CR energy density profile with respect to relaxed ones
with very subsonic turbulence. This translates into a bimodality of the
expected diffuse radio and gamma ray emission of clusters. Thus, the observed
bimodality of cluster radio halos appears to be a natural consequence of the
interplay of CR transport processes, independent of the model of radio halo
formation, be it hadronic interactions of CR protons or re-acceleration of
low-energy CR electrons.

  Our results confirm that the FeII velocities (v_Fe) have tighter and more
homogeneous correlation with the estimated photospheric velocities than the
ones measured from Hbeta, but both suffer from phase-dependent systematic
deviations from those. The same is true for comparison with the
cross-correlation velocities. We verify and improve the relations between v_Fe,
v_Hbeta and v_model in order to provide useful formulae for
interpolating/extrapolating the velocity curves of Type II-P SNe to phases not

biasing of the spectrogram coefficients is realized through the dependence of
such measures on a parameter, which allows refined results compared to those
obtained with standard divergences. These methods provide a low computational

sputtering, which involve dual beam setups, sequential application of ion beams
from different directions, or sample rotation, are studied with the method of
kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of ion beam erosion and surface diffusion. In
this work, we only consider erosion dominated situations. The results are
discussed by comparing them to a number of theoretical propositions and to
experimental findings. Two ion-beams aligned opposite to each other produce
stationary, symmetric ripples. Two ion beams crossing at right angle will
produce square patterns only, if they are exactly balanced. In all other cases
of crossed beams, ripple patterns are created, and their orientations are shown
to be predictable from linear continuum theory. In sequential ion beam
sputtering we find a very rapid destruction of structures created from the
previous beam direction after a rotation step, which leads to a transient
decrease of overall roughness. Superpositions of patterns from several rotation
steps are difficult to obtain, as they exist only in very short time windows.
In setups with a single beam directed towards a rotating sample, we find a
non-monotonic dependence of roughness on rotation frequency, with a very
pronounced minimum appearing at the frequency scale set by the relaxation of
prestructures observed in sequential ion beam setups. Furthermore we find that
the logarithm of the height of structures decreases proportional to the inverse
frequency.

Henselian valued fields $K$ of equi-characteristic 0, and prove that they

t-stratifications also contain non-local information about the stratified sets.
For example, they do not only see the singularities in the valued field, but
also those in the residue field.
  Like Whitney stratifications, t-stratifications exist for different classes
of subsets of $K^n$, e.g. algebraic subvarieties or certain classes of analytic
subsets. The general framework are definable sets (in the sense of model
theory) in a language that satisfies certain hypotheses.
  We give two applications. First, we show that t-stratifications in suitable
valued fields $K$ induce classical Whitney stratifications in $\Bbb R$ or $\Bbb
C$; in particular, the existence of t-stratifications implies the existence of
Whitney stratifications. This uses methods of non-standard analysis.
  Second, we show how, using t-stratifications, one can determine the
ultra-metric isometry type of definable subsets of $\Bbb Z_p^n$ for $p$
sufficiently big. For those $p$, this proves a conjecture stated in a previous
article. In particular, this yields a new, geometric proof of the rationality

alternative for traditional, silicon-based computers. Main advantages of
biomolecular computers are massive parallel processing of data, expanded
capacity of storing information and compatibility with living organisms (first
attempts of using biomolecular computers in cancer therapy through blocking of
improper genetic information are described in Benenson et al.(2004). However,
biomolecular computers have several drawbacks including time-consuming
procedures of preparing of input, problems in detecting output signals and
interference with by-products. Due to these obstacles, there are few laboratory
implementations of theoretically designed DNA computers (like the Turing
machine and pushdown automaton), but there are many implementations of DNA
computers for particular problems. The first practical laboratory
implementation of the general theoretical model of a machine performing
DNA-based calculations was a simple two-symbol two-state finite automaton
established by Benenson et al.(2001). In the present work, we propose a new
attitude, extending the capability of DNA-based finite automaton, by employing
two or potentially more restriction enzymes instead of one used in other works.
This creates an opportunity to implement in laboratories of more complex finite
automata and other theoretical models of computers: pushdown automata, Turing
machines.

spacecraft are used to determine the kinematics and expansion rate of a CBF
wavefront observed on 2010 August 14. The CBF was found to have a lower initial
velocity with weaker deceleration in STEREO observations compared to SDO (~340
km/s and -72 m/s/s as opposed to ~410 km/s and -279 m/s/s). The CBF kinematics
from SDO were found to be highly passband-dependent, with an initial velocity
ranging from 379+/-12 km/s to 460+/-28 km/s and acceleration ranging from
-128+/-28 m/s/s to -431+/-86 m/s/s in the 335A and 304A passbands respectively.
These kinematics were used to estimate a quiet coronal magnetic field strength
range of ~1-2 G. Significant pulse broadening was also observed, with expansion
rates of ~130 km/s (STEREO) and ~220 km/s (SDO). By treating the CBF as a
linear superposition of sinusoidal waves within a Gaussian envelope, the
resulting dispersion rate of the pulse was found to be ~8-13 Mm^2 s^-1. These
results are indicative of a fast-mode magnetoacoustic wave pulse propagating

RMS position uncertainty of 1.24"" facilitates accurate matching against
catalogs at optical, infrared and other wavelengths. Differential source counts
are determined down to <~10 mJy. There is no evidence for flattening of the
counts towards lower flux densities as observed in deep radio surveys at higher

radio-loud AGN population that explains the counts at higher flux densities.

similar field dependence as the tunnel magnetoresistance. The amplitude of the
thermal gradient is derived from calibration measurements in combination with
finite element simulations of the heat flux. Based on this, large
spin-dependent Seebeck coefficients of the order of (240 \pm 110) \muV/K are
derived. From additional measurements on MTJs after dielectric breakdown, a
tunneling magneto thermopower up to 90% can be derived for 1.5 nm MgO based MTJ
nanopillars.

advanced applications, the load increments can be controlled for instance by
prescribing the number of iterations of the nonlinear resolution procedure, or
by using an arc-length algorithm. These techniques usually introduce a

the unrelenting growth of man-made objects together with the overcrowding of
the useful satellite orbits, and the real space debris and NEO hazards, has
made necessary to carry out surveys of the space looking for uncatalogued

Tracking (SST) as a primary Space Situational Awareness element and, it is
known, that the best instrument for this task is a fully robotic wide-field
telescope with a minimum aperture of 40cm.
  The Baker-Nunn Cameras (BNCs) were produced by the Smithsonian Institution
during the late 50s as an optical tracking system for artificial satellites.
These wide-field telescopes of 50cm of aperture were manufactured by Perkin-
Elmer (optics) and Boller & Chivens (mechanics) with the highest quality
specifications. The TFRM is a fully robotic refurbished BNC that exploits the
excellent mechanical and optical original design to obtain an equatorial
telescope with a useful 4.4{\deg}x4.4{\deg} CCD field of view. TFRM is
therefore a European asset very well suited for SST (satellites and space
debris) and NEO observations. Moreover, its control system allows tracking of
all kinds of orbits, including LEOs.

approaches to scheduling problems have been introduced. They have in common the

favorably to more classical constraint programming methods relying on
propagation algorithms for global unary or cumulative resource constraints and
dedicated search heuristics. In particular, we described an approach that
combines restarting, with a generic adaptive heuristic and solution guided
branching on a simple model based on a decomposition of disjunctive

important subclass of job shop scheduling problems (JSPs), where the objective
function involves minimization of earliness/tardiness costs. We further show
that our technique can be improved by adding domain specific information for
one variant of the JSP (involving time lag constraints). In particular we
introduce a dedicated greedy heuristic, and an improved model for the case
where the maximal time lag is 0 (also referred to as no-wait JSPs).

completeness of an infinite system of solutions of the stationary Schr\""odinger
equation from a certain class. The system of solutions is obtained as an
application of the theory of bicomplex pseudoanalytic functions and its

CMFGEN model fits to spectra of 1994, 2000, 2002 and 2009. The results are as
follows: a) The long term S Dor-type variability is associated with changes of
the hydrostatic radius; b) The 1994 eruption involved changes in its bolometric
luminosity and wind structure; c) the emission-line strength, the wind velocity
and the continuum luminosity underwent correlated variations in the sense that
a decreasing V$_\infty$ is associated with increasing emission line and
continuum levels; and d) The spectrum of the third star in the system ({\it
Star C}) is well-fit by a T$_{eff}$=32 K model atmosphere with SMC chemical
abundances.
  For all epochs, the wind of the erupting star is optically thick at the sonic
point and is thus driven mainly by the continuum opacity. We speculate that the
wind switches between two stable regimes driven by the ""hot"" (during the
eruption) and the ""cool"" (post-eruption) iron opacity bumps as defined by
Lamers & Nugis (2002) and Gr\""afener and Hamann (2008), and thus the wind may
undergo a bi-stability jump of a different nature from that which occurs in

interacting with an initially unknown environment in real time. In such
simultaneous planning and learning problems, the agent has to select its
actions in a limited amount of time, while sensing only a local part of the
environment centered at the agents current location. Real-time heuristic search
agents select actions using a limited lookahead search and evaluating the
frontier states with a heuristic function. Over repeated experiences, they
refine heuristic values of states to avoid infinite loops and to converge to
better solutions. The wide spread of such settings in autonomous software and
hardware agents has led to an explosion of real-time search algorithms over the
last two decades. Not only is a potential user confronted with a hodgepodge of
algorithms, but he also faces the choice of control parameters they use. In
this paper we address both problems. The first contribution is an introduction
of a simple three-parameter framework (named LRTS) which extracts the core
ideas behind many existing algorithms. We then prove that LRTA*, epsilon-LRTA*,
SLA*, and gamma-Trap algorithms are special cases of our framework. Thus, they
are unified and extended with additional features. Second, we prove
completeness and convergence of any algorithm covered by the LRTS framework.
Third, we prove several upper-bounds relating the control parameters and
solution quality. Finally, we analyze the influence of the three control
parameters empirically in the realistic scalable domains of real-time
navigation on initially unknown maps from a commercial role-playing game as
well as routing in ad hoc sensor networks.

relatively simple interactions between primitives. Since programming problems
become more and more complexes and transverses, our vision is that application
development should be process at two scales: micro- and macro-programming where
at the micro-level the paradigm is step-by-step and at macro-level the paradigm
is emergence. For micro-programming, which focuses on how things happen,
popular languages, Java, C++, Python, are imperative writing languages where
the code is a sequence of sentences executed by the computer. For
macro-programming, which focuses on how things connect, popular languages,
labVIEW, Blender, Simulink, are graphical data flow languages such that the
program is a composition of operators, a unit-process consuming input data and
producing output data, and connectors, a data-flow between an output data and
an input data of two operators. However, despite their fruitful applications,
these macro-languages are not transversal since different data-structures of
native data-structures cannot be integrated in their framework easily. Cameleon
language is a graphical data flow language following a two-scale paradigm. It
allows an easy up-scale that is the integration of any library writing in C++
in the data flow language. Cameleon language aims to democratize
macro-programming by an intuitive interaction between the human and the
computer where building an application based on a data-process and a GUI is a
simple task to learn and to do. Cameleon language allows conditional execution
and repetition to solve complex macro-problems. In this paper we introduce a
new model based on the extension of the petri net model for the description of
how the Cameleon language executes a composition.

  Boolean Formulas",,"Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 26, pages
  371-416, 2006","10.1613/jair.1959",,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Resolution is the rule of inference at the basis of most procedures for
automated reasoning. In these procedures, the input formula is first translated
into an equisatisfiable formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) and then
represented as a set of clauses. Deduction starts by inferring new clauses by
resolution, and goes on until the empty clause is generated or satisfiability
of the set of clauses is proven, e.g., because no new clauses can be generated.
  In this paper, we restrict our attention to the problem of evaluating
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs). In this setting, the above outlined
deduction process is known to be sound and complete if given a formula in CNF
and if a form of resolution, called Q-resolution, is used. We introduce
Q-resolution on terms, to be used for formulas in disjunctive normal form. We
show that the computation performed by most of the available procedures for
QBFs --based on the Davis-Logemann-Loveland procedure (DLL) for propositional
satisfiability-- corresponds to a tree in which Q-resolution on terms and
clauses alternate. This poses the theoretical bases for the introduction of
learning, corresponding to recording Q-resolution formulas associated with the
nodes of the tree. We discuss the problems related to the introduction of
learning in DLL based procedures, and present solutions extending
state-of-the-art proposals coming from the literature on propositional
satisfiability. Finally, we show that our DLL based solver extended with
learning, performs significantly better on benchmarks used in the 2003 QBF
solvers comparative evaluation.
