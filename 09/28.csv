magnetic field lines from the inner disk edge to the stellar surface. The
accretion flow thus depends on the geometry of the magnetic field. This paper
extends previous work by constructing a collection of orthogonal coordinate
systems, including the corresponding differential operators, where one
coordinate traces the magnetic field lines. This formalism allows for an
(essentially) analytic description of the geometry and the conditions required
for the flow to pass through sonic points. Using this approach, we revisit the
problem of magnetically controlled accretion flow in a dipole geometry, and
then generalize the treatment to consider magnetic fields with multiple
components, including dipole, octupole, and split monopole contributions. This
approach can be generalized further to consider more complex magnetic field
configurations. Observations indicate that accreting young stars have
substantial dipole and octupole components, and that accretion flow is
transonic. If the effective equation of state for the fluid is too stiff, the
flow cannot pass smoothly through the sonic points in steady state. For a
multipole field of order \ell, we derive a constraint on the polytropic index,
n>\ell+3/2, required for steady transonic flow to reach free-fall velocities.
For octupole fields, inferred on surfaces of T Tauri stars, n>9/2, so that the
flow must be close to isothermal. The inclusion of octupole field components
produces higher densities at the stellar surface and smaller hot spots, which
occur at higher latitudes; the magnetic truncation radius is also modified.
This contribution thus increases our understanding of magnetically controlled
accretion for young stellar objects and can be applied to a variety of
additional astrophysical problems.

regions on the sky using the WMAP 7-year data. Here, we report that the north
hat and the south hat regions at the high Galactic latitude (|b| >= 30 deg)
show anomaly in the power spectrum amplitude around the third peak, which is
statistically significant up to 3 sigma. We try to figure out the cause of the
observed anomaly by analyzing the low Galactic latitude (|b|< 30 deg) regions
where the galaxy contamination is expected to be stronger, and regions that are
weakly or strongly dominated by the WMAP instrument noise. We also consider the
possible effect of unresolved radio point sources. We found another but less
statistically significant anomaly in the low Galactic latitude north and south
regions whose behavior is opposite to the one at the high latitude. Our
analysis shows that the observed north-south anomaly at high latitude becomes
weaker on the regions with high number of observations (weak instrument noise),
suggesting that the anomaly is significant at sky regions that are dominated by
the WMAP instrument noise. We have checked that the observed north-south
anomaly has weak dependences on the bin-width used in the power spectrum
estimation and the Galactic latitude cut. We have also discussed the
possibility that the detected anomaly may hinge on the particular choice of the
multipole bin around the third peak. We anticipate that the issue of whether
the anomaly is intrinsic one or due to the WMAP instrument noise will be
resolved by the forthcoming Planck data.

dispersion, and size, are derived from the natural-seeing observations, while
the follow up AO observations will be presented in the next paper of this

at z~2, covering a wide range in mass and SFR. The Halpha integrated properties
of the 25 Halpha detected galaxies are similar to those of other IFS samples at
the same redshifts. Good agreement is found among the SFRs derived from Halpha
luminosity and other diagnostic methods, provided the extinction affecting the
Halpha luminosity is about twice that affecting the continuum. A preliminary
kinematic analysis, based on the maximum observed velocity difference across

importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and environmental
fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt persistence. One
approach to examining the interplay between these deterministic and stochastic
forces is the construction and analysis of stochastic difference equations
$X_{t+1}=F(X_t,\xi_{t+1})$ where $X_t \in \R^k$ represents the state of the
populations and $\xi_1,\xi_2,...$ is a sequence of random variables
representing environmental stochasticity. In the analysis of these stochastic
models, many theoretical population biologists are interested in whether the
models are bounded and persistent. Here, boundedness asserts that
asymptotically $X_t$ tends to remain in compact sets. In contrast, persistence
requires that $X_t$ tends to be ""repelled"" by some ""extinction set"" $S_0\subset
\R^k$. Here, results on both of these proprieties are reviewed for single
species, multiple species, and structured population models. The results are
illustrated with applications to stochastic versions of the Hassell and Ricker
single species models, Ricker, Beverton-Holt, lottery models of competition,
and lottery models of rock-paper-scissor games. A variety of conjectures and
suggestions for future research are presented.

effects. Here we present the detection of non-local spin signals using
non-magnetic detectors, via an as yet unexplored non-linear interaction between
spin and charge. In analogy to the Seebeck effect, where a heat current
generates a charge potential, we demonstrate that a spin current in a
paramagnet leads to a charge potential, if the conductivity is energy
dependent. We use graphene as a model system to study this effect, as recently
proposed. The physical concept demonstrated here is generally valid, opening
new possibilities for spintronics.

sapphire substrates by thermal oxidation of Zn-metallic films in air ambient.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra indicate that the resulting films possess a
polycrystalline hexagonal wurtzite structure without preferred orientation. For
films having a thickness of 200 nm, crystal grain size was observed to decrease
with increasing annealing temperature up to 600C, and then increase at higher
temperatures. Thicker films demonstrated a modest increase in grain size as
temperature increased from 300C to 1200C. The influence of film thickness on
the optical properties was investigated using room temperature
photoluminescence (PL). Specifically, PL spectra indicate four emission bands:
excitonic ultraviolet, blue, and deep-level green and yellow emission. The
strongest UV emission and narrowest full width at half maximum (0.09 eV) was
observed for films having a thickness of 200 nm and annealed at low temperature
(300C). The ratio of deep-level green emission to UV excitonic emission was
observed to decrease with decreasing annealing temperature, which is attributed
to the generation of fewer oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygen ions in the
bulk. As film thickness decreased, we observed the emergence of blue emission
and a significant red shift (0.15 eV) in the bandgap. The emergence of blue
emission and the corresponding decrease in emission associated with bulk
defects when depletion width grows relative to the bulk suggests that the
origin of the blue emission is related to the negatively charged Zinc
interstitials found within the deletion region near the interface.

rank-deficient. Tikhonov regularization may also be included. Since $A$ is only
involved in matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplications, it can be a dense
or sparse matrix or a linear operator, and \texttt{LSRN} automatically speeds
up when $A$ is sparse or a fast linear operator. The preconditioning phase
consists of a random normal projection, which is embarrassingly parallel, and a
singular value decomposition of size $\lceil \gamma \min(m,n) \rceil \times
\min(m,n)$, where $\gamma$ is moderately larger than 1, e.g., $\gamma = 2$. We
prove that the preconditioned system is well-conditioned, with a strong
concentration result on the extreme singular values, and hence that the number
of iterations is fully predictable when we apply LSQR or the Chebyshev
semi-iterative method. As we demonstrate, the Chebyshev method is particularly
efficient for solving large problems on clusters with high communication cost.
Numerical results demonstrate that on a shared-memory machine, \texttt{LSRN}
outperforms LAPACK's DGELSD on large dense problems, and MATLAB's backslash
(SuiteSparseQR) on sparse problems. Further experiments demonstrate that
\texttt{LSRN} scales well on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud cluster.

equations for spatial averages such as density, linear momentum, and energy

closed form because the stress and the heat flux cannot be evaluated without
the knowledge of particle positions and velocities. We propose a closure method
for approximating fluxes in terms of other meso-scale averages. The main idea
is to rewrite the non-linear averages as linear convolutions that relate micro-
and meso-scale dynamical functions. The convolutions can be approximately
inverted using regularization methods developed for solving ill-posed problems.
This yields closed form constitutive equations that can be evaluated without
solving the underlying ODEs. We test the method numerically on Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
chains with two different potentials: the classical Lennard-Jones, and the
purely repulsive potential used in granular materials modeling. The initial
conditions incorporate velocity fluctuations on scales that are smaller than
the size of the averaging window. The results show very good agreement between
the exact stress and its closed form approximation.

be interpreted as a choice of weight for each nucleotide triplet. We train the
parameters so that the topological pressure fits the observed coding sequence
density on the human genome, and use this to give ab initio predictions of CDS
density over windows of size around 66,000bp on the genomes of Mus Musculus,
Rhesus Macaque and Drososphilia Melanogaster. While the differences between
these genomes are too great to expect that training on the human genome could
predict, for example, the exact locations of genes, we demonstrate that our
method gives reasonable estimates for the ""coarse scale"" problem of predicting
CDS density.
  Inspired again by ergodic theory, the weightings of the nucleotide triplets
obtained from our training procedure are used to define a probability
distribution on finite sequences, which can be used to distinguish between
intron and exon sequences from the human genome of lengths between 750bp and
5,000bp. At the end of the paper, we explain the theoretical underpinning for

sequencing complexity, in order to facilitate efficient semi-autonomous
quantum-coherent systems. With this aim, we focus on digital sequences where
all interpulse time periods are integer multiples of a minimum clock period and
compatibility with simple digital classical control circuitry is intrinsic,
using so-called em Walsh functions as a general mathematical framework. The
Walsh functions are an orthonormal set of basis functions which may be
associated directly with the control propagator for a digital modulation
scheme, and dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences can be derived from the
locations of digital transitions therein. We characterize the suite of the
resulting Walsh dynamical decoupling (WDD) sequences, and identify the number
of periodic square-wave (Rademacher) functions required to generate a Walsh
function as the key determinant of the error-suppressing features of the
relevant WDD sequence. WDD forms a unifying theoretical framework as it
includes a large variety of well-known and novel DD sequences, providing
significant flexibility and performance benefits relative to basic
quasi-periodic design. We also show how Walsh modulation may be employed for
the protection of certain nontrivial logic gates, providing an implementation
of a dynamically corrected gate. Based on these insights we identify Walsh
modulation as a digital-efficient approach for physical-layer error
suppression.

spectroscopic and interferometric studies have shown that it is a rapid rotator
seen nearly pole one, a rare orientation particularly interesting for seismic
studies. In this paper we present a first systematic search for pulsations in
Vega. The goal of the present work is to detect for the first time pulsations
in a rapidly rotating star seen nearly pole-on. Vega was monitored in
quasi-continuous high-resolution echelle spectroscopy. A total of 4478 spectra
were obtained within 3 individual runs in 2008, 2009 and 2010 at high
resolution. This data set should represent the most extensive high S/N, high
resolution quasi-continuous survey obtained on Vega as of today. Equivalent
photospheric absorption profiles were calculated for the stellar spectrum, but
also for the telluric lines acting as a radial velocity reference. Residual
velocities were analysed and periodic low amplitude variations, potentially
indicative of stellar pulsations, detected. All three data sets revealed the
presence of residual periodic variations: 5.32 and 9.19 c/d, (A approx 6 m/s)
in 2008, 12.71 and 13.25 c/d, (A approx 8 m/s) in 2009 and 5.42 and 10.82 c/d,
(A approx 3-4 m/s) in 2010. A Lomb-Scargle periodogram of each velocity bin of
the equivalent profile was performed for the 2010 run, not showing the presence
of any higher order nrp mode. It is too early to conclude that the variations
are due to stellar pulsations, and a confirmation of the detection with a
highly stable spectrograph is a necessary next step. If pulsations are
confirmed, their very small amplitudes show that the star would belong to a
category of very ""quiet"" pulsators.

faint dwarfs that had never been catalogued before. In addition, we present 16
newly identified low surface brightness galaxy candidates, almost half of them
displaying morphologies consistent with being Antlia's counterparts of Local
Group dSphs, that extend the faint luminosity limit of our study down to MB =
-10.1 (BT = 22.6) mag. We built an improved CMR in the Washington photometric
system, i.e. integrated T1 magnitudes versus (C - T1) colours, which extends
\sim 4 mag faintwards the limit of spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members.
When only confirmed early-type members are considered, this relation extends
over 10 mag in luminosity with no apparent change in slope or increase in
colour dispersion towards its faint end. The intrinsic colour scatter of the
relation is compared with those reported for other clusters of galaxies; we
argue that it is likely that the large scatter of the CMR, usually reported at
faint magnitudes, is mostly due to photometric errors along with an improper
membership/morphological classification. The distinct behaviour of the
luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness relation at the bright and
faint ends is analyzed, while it is confirmed that dE galaxies on the same
relation present a very similar effective radius, regardless of their colour.
The projected spatial distribution of the member sample confirms the existence
of two groups in Antlia, each one dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy and
with one cE located close to each giant.

interactions in the cluster on planetary systems. We model clusters initially
in cool collapse, in virial equilibrium and expanding, and place a 1
Jupiter-mass planet at either 5au or 30au from their host stars, with zero
eccentricity. We find that after 10Myr 10% of planets initially orbiting at
30au have been liberated from their parent star and form a population of
free-floating planets. A small number of these planets are captured by other
stars. A further 10% have their orbital eccentricity significantly altered. The
change in eccentricity is often accompanied by a change in orbital inclination
which may lead to additional dynamical perturbations in planetary systems. The
fraction of liberated and disrupted planetary systems is highest for subvirial
clusters, but virial and supervirial clusters also dynamically process
planetary systems, due to interactions in the substructure. Of the planets that
become free-floating, those that remain observationally associated with the
cluster (within two half-mass radii of the cluster centre) have a similar
velocity distribution to the entire star cluster, irrespective of whether they
were on a 5au or a 30au orbit, with median velocities typically 1km/s.
Conversely, those planets that are no longer associated with the cluster have
similar velocities to the non-associated stars if they were originally at 5au
(9km/s), whereas planets originally at 30au have much lower velocities
(3.8km/s) than the stars (10.8km/s). These findings highlight potential
pitfalls of concluding that (a) planets with similar velocities to the cluster
stars represent the very low-mass end of the IMF, and (b) planets on the
periphery of a cluster with very different observed velocities form through
different mechanisms.

may be associated with rapid black hole spin. The 4U 1957+11 spectra also
require a very low normalization, which can be explained by a combination of
small inner disk radius and a large distance (>10 kpc) which places 4U 1957+11
well into the Galactic halo. We perform joint fits to the Suzaku spectra with
both relativistic and Comptonized disk models. Assuming a low mass black hole
and the nearest distance (3 M_sun, 10 kpc), the dimensionless spin parameter a*
= Jc/GM^2 >~ 0.9. Higher masses and farther distances yield a*~1. Similar
conclusions are reached with Comptonization models; they imply a combination of
small inner disk radii (or, equivalently, rapid spin) and large distance. Low
spin cannot be recovered unless 4U 1957+11 is a low mass black hole that is at

ultra-relativistic jet visible on kiloparsec scales, and its large mass and
relative proximity allow for event horizon scale imaging with very long
baseline interferometry at millimeter wavelengths (mm-VLBI). Recently,
relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of black hole accretion
flows have proven capable of launching magnetically-dominated jets. We
construct time-dependent disc/jet models of the innermost portion of the M87
nucleus by performing relativistic radiative transfer calculations from one
such simulation. We identify two types of models, jet-dominated or disc/jet,
that can explain the spectral properties of M87, and use them to make
predictions for current and future mm-VLBI observations. The Gaussian source
size for the favored sky orientation and inclination from observations of the
large-scale jet is 33-44 microarcseconds (~4-6 Schwarzschild radii) on current
mm-VLBI telescopes, very similar to existing observations of Sgr A*. The black
hole shadow, direct evidence of an event horizon, should be visible in future
measurements using baselines between Hawaii and Mexico. Both models exhibit
variability at millimeter wavelengths with factor of ~2 amplitudes on year
timescales. For the low inclination of M87, the counter-jet dominates the event
horizon scale millimeter wavelength emission from the jet-forming region.

face-on spiral galaxy, M83, using WFC3/HST imaging. The clusters are selected
through visual inspection to be centrally concentrated, symmetric, and resolved
on the images, which allows us to differentiate between clusters and likely
unbound associations. We compare our sample with previous studies and show that
the differences between the catalogues are largely due to the inclusion of
large numbers of diffuse associations within previous catalogues. The
luminosity function of the clusters is well approximated by a power-law with
index, -2, over most of the observed range, however a steepening is seen at M_V
= -9.3 and -8.8 in the inner and outer fields, respectively. Additionally, we
show that the cluster population is inconsistent with a pure power-law mass
distribution, but instead exhibits a truncation at the high mass end. If
described as a Schechter function, the characteristic mass is 1.6 and 0.5 *
10^5 Msun, for the inner and outer fields, respectively, in agreement with
previous estimates of other cluster populations in spiral galaxies. Comparing
the predictions of the mass independent disruption (MID) and mass dependent
disruption (MDD) scenarios with the observed distributions, we find that both
models can accurately fit the data. However, for the MID case, the fraction of
clusters destroyed (or mass lost) per decade in age is dependent on the
environment, hence, the age/mass distributions of clusters are not universal.
In the MDD case, the disruption timescale scales with galactocentric distance
(being longer in the outer regions of the galaxy) in agreement with analytic
and numerical predictions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results
on other extragalactic surveys, focussing on the fraction of stars that form in
clusters and the need (or lack thereof) for infant mortality.

Little is known of the parental molecular clouds of the IRDCs. Aims: We
demonstrate the feasibility of the near-infrared (NIR) dust extinction mapping

8 kpc. Methods: We derive NIR extinction maps for 10 prominent IRDC complexes
using a color-excess mapping technique and NIR data from the UKIDSS/Galactic
Plane Survey. We compare the resulting maps to the 13CO emission line data, to
the 8 \mu m dust opacity data, and to the millimeter dust emission data. We
derive distances for the clouds by comparing the observed NIR source densities
to the Besancon stellar distribution model and compare them to the kinematic
distance estimates. Results: The NIR extinction maps provide a view to the IRDC
complexes over the dynamical range of Av = 2 - 40 mag, in spatial resolution of
30"". The NIR extinction data correlate well with the 13CO data and probe a
similar gas component, but also extend to higher column densities. The NIR data
reveal a wealth of extended structures surrounding the dense gas traced by the
8 \mu m shadowing features and sub-mm dust emission, showing that the clouds
contain typically > 10 times more mass than traced by those tracers. The IRDC
complexes of our sample contain relatively high amount of high-column density
material, and their cumulative column density distributions resemble active
nearby star-forming clouds like Orion rather than less active clouds like
California. Conclusions: NIR dust extinction data provide a new powerful tool
to probe the mass distribution of the parental molecular clouds of IRDCs up to
the distances of D = 8 kpc. This encourages for deeper NIR observations of
IRDCs, because the sensitivity and resolution of the data can be directly
enhanced with dedicated observations.

carbon star nature of the object and allow us to classify its spectral type as
C(6,2). This classification places CGCS 5926 at a distance of about 5 kpc from
Earth. BVRcIc photometry of the star shows that it displays a variability of
about 0.3 mag on timescales of months, with the star getting bluer when its

global characteristics. The source is not detected at X-rays with Swift/XRT
down to a 0.3-10 keV band luminosity of around 3e32 erg/s. This nondetection is
apparently in contrast with the ROSAT data; however we show that, even if the
probability that CGCS 5926 can be a SyXB appears quite low, the present

other interpretations even more unlikely if we assume that the ROSAT detection

vortices - topological defects which can exist in chiral superconductors. Using
London theory it is demonstrated that at sufficiently small applied and chiral
fields the existence of domain walls and vortices in the sample is not favored
and the sample's configuration is a single domain. The particular chirality of
the single-domain configuration is neither favored nor disfavored by the
applied field. Increasing the field leads to an entry of a domain wall loop or
a vortex into the sample. Formation of a straight domain wall is never
preferred in equilibrium. Values of the entry (critical) fields for both types
of defects, as well as the equilibrium size of the domain wall loop, are
calculated. We also consider a mesoscopic chiral sample and calculate its
zero-field magnetization, susceptibility and a change in the magnetic moment
due to a vortex or a domain wall entry. We show that in a case of a soft domain
wall whose energetics is dominated by the chiral current (and not by the
surface tension) its behavior in mesoscopic samples is substantially different
from that in the bulk case and can be used for a controllable transfer of edge
excitations. The applicability of these results to Sr2RuO4 - a tentative chiral
superconductor - is discussed.

found complex X-ray spectral variability on time scales of both months and

along the line of sight. As a consequence, the observed optical-to-X-ray

outflowing much faster (v ~ 16500 km/s) than the UV absorbing one (v ~ 5000

biology. Although it is NP-hard to find an optimal solution for an arbitrary
number of sequences, due to the importance of this problem researchers are
trying to push the limits of exact algorithms further. Since MSA can be cast as
a classical path finding problem, it is attracting a growing number of AI
researchers interested in heuristic search algorithms as a challenge with
actual practical relevance. In this paper, we first review two previous,
complementary lines of research. Based on Hirschbergs algorithm, Dynamic
Programming needs O(kN^(k-1)) space to store both the search frontier and the
nodes needed to reconstruct the solution path, for k sequences of length N.
Best first search, on the other hand, has the advantage of bounding the search
space that has to be explored using a heuristic. However, it is necessary to
maintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the
search from re-expanding them at higher cost. Earlier approaches to reduce the
Closed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the Open list, or
must retain at least the boundary of the Closed list. In this article, we
present an algorithm that attempts at combining the respective advantages; like
A* it uses a heuristic for pruning the search space, but reduces both the
maximum Open and Closed size to O(kN^(k-1)), as in Dynamic Programming. The
underlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing
upper bounds, but using the DP ordering as the key for the Open priority queue.
With a suitable choice of thresholds, in practice, a running time below four
times that of A* can be expected. In our experiments we show that our algorithm
outperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal
multiple sequence alignments, Partial Expansion A*, both in time and memory.
Moreover, we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of
pairs of sequences, but of larger subsets. This idea is not new; however, to
make it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the
heuristic computation appropriately, or the overhead can obliterate any
possible gain. Furthermore, we discuss a number of improvements in time and
space efficiency with regard to practical implementations. Our algorithm, used
in conjunction with higher-dimensional heuristics, is able to calculate for the
first time the optimal alignment for almost all of the problems in Reference 1
of the benchmark database BAliBASE.

on motion-based communication mediated by the dynamics of a control system.
Specifically we are interested in how mobile agents engaged in a shared
activity such as dance can use motion as a medium for transmitting certain
types of messages. The first part of the paper adopts the terminology of motion
description languages and deconstructs an elementary form of the well-known
popular dance, Salsa, in terms of four motion primitives (dance steps). Several
notions of dance complexity are introduced. We describe an experiment in which
ten performances by an actual pair of dancers are evaluated by judges and then
compared in terms of proposed complexity metrics. An energy metric is also
defined. Values of this metric are obtained by summing the lengths of motion
segments executed by wheeled robots replicating the movements of the human
dancers in each of the ten dance performances. Of all the metrics that are
considered in this experiment, energy is the most closely correlated with the
human judges' assessments of performance quality.
  The second part of the paper poses a general class of dual objective motion
control problems in which a primary objective (artistic execution of a dance
step or efficient movement toward a specified terminal state) is combined with
a communication objective. Solutions of varying degrees of explicitness can be
given in several classes of problems of communicating through the dynamics of
finite dimensional linear control systems. In this setting it is shown that the
cost of adding a communication component to motions that steer a system between
prescribed pairs of states is independent of those states. At the same time,
the optimal encoding problem itself is shown to be a problem of packing
geometric objects, and it remains open.

rigorous, probabalistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based on
precise photometric redshifts and X-ray selected groups drawn from the COSMOS
field. The groups have masses in the range 10^13 < M_200c/M_sun < 10^14 and
span redshifts 0<z<1. We characterize our selection algorithm via tests on
spectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the VLT, and by
applying our method to detailed mock catalogs. We find that our group member
galaxy sample has a purity of 84% and completeness of 92% within 0.5 R200c. We
measure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on the
quality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as well

the electronic dynamics. We employ the scattering matrix approach to quantum
transport to develop a unified theory of nanoelectromechanical systems out of
equilibrium. For a slow mechanical mode, the current can be obtained from the
Landauer-B\""uttiker formula in the strictly adiabatic limit. The leading
correction to the adiabatic limit reduces to Brouwer's formula for the current
of a quantum pump in the absence of the bias voltage. The principal result of
the present paper are scattering matrix expressions for the current-induced

Langevin dynamics of the mechanical modes. Specifically, we derive expressions
for the (typically nonconservative) mean force, for the (possibly negative)
damping force, an effective ""Lorentz"" force which exists even for time reversal
invariant systems, and the fluctuating Langevin force originating from Nyquist
and shot noise of the current flow. We apply our general formalism to several

  191-246, 2006","10.1613/jair.1705",,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fast Downward is a classical planning system based on heuristic search. It
can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the
propositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL
conditions and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known
planners such as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching
the space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction. However,
unlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the
propositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the
input is first translated into an alternative representation called
multi-valued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a
propositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative
representation, Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning
tasks for computing its heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic,
which is very different from traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring
negative interactions of operators.
  In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downwards approach to solving
multi-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal
graph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present
some novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downwards
best-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful
actions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of
heuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on
search performance, and multi-heuristic best-first search combines several
heuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an
orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state
expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new
non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search,
which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way.
  Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the ""classical (i.e.,
propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning
Competition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF
and LPG. Our experiments show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks
of the earlier planning competitions and provide some insights about the
usefulness of the new search enhancements.

sits uncomfortably even within ""far-fetched"" theories. In the context of
non-linear realizations of the Lorentz group (where superluminal misbehaviour
is run of the mill) one has to accept rather contrived constructions to predict
superluminal properties for the neutrino. The simplest explanation is to
require that at least one of the mass states be tachyonic. We show that due to
neutrino mixing, the flavor energy does not suffer from the usual runaway
pathologies of tachyons. For non-tachyonic mass states the theories become more
speculative. A neutrino specific dispersion relation is exhibited, rendering
the amplitude of the effect reasonable for a standard Planck energy. This uses
the fact that the beam energy is close to the geometrical average of the
neutrino and Planck mass; or, seen in another way, the beam energy is
unexceptional but its gamma factor is very large. A dispersion relation
crossing over from a low energy bradyonic branch to a high energy tachyonic one
is also considered. We comment on consistency with SN 1987A within these

non-degenerate almost Hamiltonian systems, i.e., generalized Hamiltonian

superconductor. The atomic scale roughness at the surface is considered using
the random $S$ matrix model. The roughness effects on the self-consistent order
parameter, the surface mass current and the surface density of states are
studied using the quasi-classical theory. We find that the surface mass current
is suppressed by the surface roughness. The surface density of states shows a
quite similar behavior to that of superfluid ${}^3$He B phase. When the surface
is specular, the surface Andreev bound states form a band which fills the bulk
energy gap $\Delta_{\rm bulk}$. When the surface becomes diffusive, there
occurs a sharp upper edge of the surface bound states band and there opens a
sub-gap between the edge and the bulk energy gap. We show that this sub-gap is
induced by the repulsion between the surface bound states and the propagating
Bogoliubov quasi-particles through the second order process of roughness.

8-month period are well reproduced with a model consisting of multi-color disk
(MCD) emission and its Comptonization component, whose fraction is <= 25% in
the total flux. In spite of the flux variability over a factor of 3, the
innermost disk radius is constant at R_in = 61 +/- 2 km for the inclination

with those of the past measurements with Tenma in the high/soft state. Assuming
that the disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit of a non-spinning
black hole, we estimate the black hole mass to be M = 6.8 +/- 0.2 M_sun for i =
46 deg and d = 8 kpc, which is consistent with that estimated from the Suzaku

frequency bands and foreground-reduced CMB maps. Simulated CMB maps with
assigned type and amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity are important tools
to determine the strength, sensitivity and limitations of non-Gaussian
estimators. Here we investigate whether and to what extent our non-Gaussian
indicators have sensitivity to detect non-Gaussianity of local type,
particularly with amplitude within the seven-year WMAP bounds. We make a
systematic study by employing our statistical tools to generate maps of
skewness and kurtosis from several thousands of simulated maps equipped with
non-Gaussianity of local type of various amplitudes. We show that our
indicators can be used to detect large-angle local-type non-Gaussianity only
for relatively large values of the non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm
local}$. Thus, our indicators have not enough sensitivity to detect deviation
from Gaussianity with the non-linear parameter within the seven-year WMAP
bounds. This result along with the outcomes of frequency bands and
foreground-reduced analyses suggest that non-Gaussianity captured in the
previous works by our indicators is not of primordial origin, although it might
have a primordial component. We have also made a comparative study of
non-Gaussianity of simulated maps and of the full-sky WMAP foreground-reduced
seven-year ILC-7yr map. An outcome of this analysis is that the level of
non-Gaussianity of ILC-7yr map is higher than that of the simulated maps for
$f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}$ within WMAP bounds. This provides quantitative
indications on the suitability of the ILC-7yr map as a Gaussian reconstruction
of the full-sky CMB.

$Local \; Index \; Theorem$ is the Connes-Moscovici local index theorem
\cite{Connes-Moscovici1}, \cite{Connes-Moscovici2}. The second ""Local"" refers
to the cyclic homology localised to a certain separable subring of the ground
algebra, while the last one refers to Alexander-Spanier type cyclic homology.
The Connes-Moscovici work is based on the operator $R(A) = \mathbf{P} -
\mathbf{e}$ associated to the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $A$ on the
smooth manifold $M$, where $\mathbf{P}$, $\mathbf{e}$ are idempotents, see
\cite{Connes-Moscovici1}, Pg. 353. The operator $R(A)$ has two main merits: it
is a smoothing operator and its distributional kernel is situated in an
arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the diagonal in $M \times M$. The operator
$R(A)$ has also two setbacks: -i) it is not an idempotent (and therefore it
does not have a genuine Connes-Chern character); -ii) even if it were an
idempotent, its Connes-Chern character would belong to the cyclic homology of
the algebra of smoothing operators (with \emph{arbitrary} supports, which is
\emph{trivial}. This paper presents a new solution to the difficulties raised
by the two setbacks. For which concerns -i), we show that although $R(A)$ is
not an idempotent, it satisfies the identity $ (\mathbf{R}(A))^{2} \;=\;
\mathbf{R}(A) - [\mathbf{R}(A) . e + e .\mathbf{R}(A) ]. $ We show that the
operator $R(A)$ has a genuine Chern character provided the cyclic homology
complex of the algebra of smoothing operators is \emph{localised} to the
separable sub-algebra $\Lambda = \mathbb{C} + \mathbb{C} . e$, see Sect. 8.1.
For which concerns -ii), we introduce the notion of \emph{local} cyclic
homology; this is constructed on the foot-steps of the Alexander-Spanier
homology, i.e. by filtering the chains of the cyclic homology complex of the
algebra of smoothing operators by their distributional support, see Sect. 7.
Using these new instruments, we give a reformulation of the Connes-Moscovici
local Index Theorem, see Theorem 23, Sect. 9. As a corollary of this theorem,
we show that the \emph{local} cyclic homology of the algebra of smoothing
operators is at least as big as the Alexander-Spanier homology of the base
manifold. The present reformulation of Connes-Moscovici local index theorem
opens the way to new investigations, see Sect. 10.

relaying scenario is considered with the protocol which employs two phases:
Multiple access (MA) Phase and Broadcast (BC) phase. It was observed by
Koike-Akino et al. that adaptively changing the network coding map used at the
relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the impact of
multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA phase. In
other words, the set of all possible channel realizations (the complex plane)
is quantized into a finite number of regions, with a specific network coding
map giving the best performance in a particular region. We highlight the issues
associated with the scheme proposed by Koike-Akino et al. and propose a scheme
which solves these issues. We obtain a quantization of the set of all possible
channel realizations analytically for the case when $M$-PSK (for $M$ any power
of 2) is the signal set used during the MA phase. It is shown that the complex
plane can be classified into two regions: a region in which any network coding
map which satisfies the so called exclusive law gives the same best performance
and a region in which the choice of the network coding map affects the
performance, which is further quantized based on the choice of the network
coding map which optimizes the performance. The quantization thus obtained
analytically, leads to the same as the one obtained using computer search for
4-PSK signal set by Koike-Akino et al., when specialized for $M=4.$

nature but also the type of constraints involved. The holy grail of
(constraint) programming: ""the user states the problem the program solves it""
remains a challenge since solution quality is tightly coupled with deriving
""effective models"", best handled by technology experts. In this paper, focusing
on the field of university timetabling, we introduce a visual graphic
communication tool that lets the user specify her problem in an abstract
manner, using a visual entity-relationship model. The entities are nodes of
mainly two types: resource nodes (lecturers, assistants, student groups) and
events nodes (lectures, lab sessions, tutorials). The links between the nodes
signify a desired relationship between them. The visual modeling abstraction
focuses on the nature of the entities and their relationships and abstracts
from an actual constraint model.

one-dimensional photonic-crystal lasing (that is, distributed feedback lasing)

been linked to important biological processes. The known mechanisms for this
transition almost exclusively involve the dynamics of the scroll filament,

novel defect-induced route to breakup of a scroll wave pinned by an inexcitable
obstacle partially extending through the bulk of the medium. The wave is
helically wound around the defect inducing sudden changes in velocity
components of the wavefront at the obstacle boundary. This results in breakup
far from the filament, eventually giving rise to spatiotemporal chaos. Our
results suggest a potentially critical role of pinning obstacles in the onset
of life-threatening disturbances of cardiac activity.

star-forming regions: G16.59-0.05, G23.01-0.41, IRAS20126+4104, and AFGL5142.
We studied these sources by means of multi-epoch VLBI observations in the 22
GHz water and 6.7 GHz methanol masers, to determine the 3-D gas kinematics
within a few thousand AU from the (proto)star. The present work exploits the
6.7 GHz maser data collected so far to investigate the milliarcsecond structure
of this maser emission at high-velocity resolution. Most of the detected 6.7
GHz maser features present an ordered (linear, or arc-like) distribution of
maser spots on the plane of the sky, together with a regular variation in the
spot LSR velocity (V_LSR) with position. Typical values for the amplitude of
the V_LSR gradients (defined in terms of the derivative of the spot V_LSR with
position) are found to be 0.1-0.2 km s^(-1) mas^(-1). In each of the four
target sources, the orientation and the amplitude of most of the feature V_LSR
gradients remain remarkably stable in time, on timescales of (at least) several
years. We also find that the data are consistent with having the V_LSR
gradients and proper motion vectors in the same direction on the sky,
considered the measurement uncertainties. The time persistency, the ordered
angular and spatial distribution, and the orientation generally similar to the
proper motions, altogether suggest a kinematical interpretation for the origin
of the 6.7 GHz maser V_LSR gradients. This work shows that the organized
motions (outflow, infall, and rotation) revealed by the (22 GHz water and 6.7
GHz methanol) masers on large scales (~100-1000 AU) also persist to very small
(~10 AU) scales.

amazing OPERA experiment of the superluminal propagation of neutrino and
experiment of the gain-assisted superluminal light propagation realized about
ten years ago. Last experiment refers on the propagation of the light,
precisely laser pulse through a medium, precisely caesium atomic gas, with
characteristic anomalous dispersion and corresponding negative group-velocity
index with very large amplitude between two closely spaced gain lines (that is
in some way similar to quantum theory of the ferromagnetism). It implies
superluminal propagation of the light through this medium. Nevertheless all
this, at it has been pointed out by authors, ""is not at odds with causality or
special relativity"", since it simply represents ""a direct consequence of the
classical interference between ... different frequency components"". We suggest
that OPERA experiment can be in some way conceptually similar to the
gain-assisted superluminal light propagation experiment. For this reason we
suppose too that OPERA experiment can be simply explained in full agreement
with causality and special relativity if there is some medium, precisely a
scalar field (e.g. dark matter field, Higgs field or similar) through which
neutrino propagates. We prove that, according to OPERA experiment data,
supposed medium must be non-dispersive while its refractive index must be
positive, smaller but relatively close to 1 (that is in some way similar to
quantum theory of the diamagnetism). If it is true OPERA experiment results do
not mean that special theory of relativity is broken, but they mean detection
of suggested medium, i.e. a scalar field (e.g. dark matter field, Higgs field
or similar).

assuming a spatially flat universe. A comparison between the constraints from
the SNLS3 and those from other SN Ia samples, such as the ESSENCE, Union2,
SDSS-II and Constitution samples, is given and the effects of different
light-curve fitters are considered. We find that SN Ia with SALT2 or SALT or
SIFTO can give consistent results and the tensions between different data sets
and different light-curve fitters are obvious for fewer-free-parameters models.
At the same time, we also study the constraints from the SNLS3 along with data
from the cosmic microwave background and the baryonic acoustic oscillations
(CMB/BAO), and the latest Hubble parameter versus redshift (H(z)). Using model
selection criteria such as $\chi^2$/dof, GoF, AIC and BIC, we find that, among
all the cosmological models considered here ($\Lambda$CDM, constant $w$,
varying $w$, DGP, modified polytropic Cardassian, and the generalized Chaplygin
gas), the flat DGP is favored by the SNLS3 alone. However, when additional
CMB/BAO or H(z) constraints are included, this is no longer the case, and the
flat $\Lambda$CDM becomes preferred.

intensive research activities owe to its important potential in the many
applied fields such as signal processing, medical imaging, communication, and
so on. This problem can be stated in the following, i.e., to seek for the
sparse coefficient vector of the given noisy observation over a redundant
dictionary such that, where is the corrupted error. Elad et al. made the
worst-case result, which shows the condition of stable recovery of sparest
overcomplete representation over is where . Although it's of easy operation for
any given matrix, this result can't provide us realistic guide in many cases.
On the other hand, most of popular analysis on the sparse reconstruction relies
heavily on the so-called RIP (Restricted Isometric Property) for matrices
developed by Candes et al., which is usually very difficult or impossible to be
justified for a given measurement matrix. In this article, we introduced a
simple and efficient way of determining the ability of given D used to recover
the sparse signal based on the statistical analysis of coherence coefficients,
where is the coherence coefficients between any two different columns of given
measurement matrix . The key mechanism behind proposed paradigm is the analysis
of statistical distribution (the mean and covariance) of . We proved that if
the resulting mean of are zero, and their covariance are as small as possible,
one can faithfully recover approximately sparse signals from a minimal number
of noisy measurements with overwhelming probability. The resulting theory is
not only suitable for almost all models - e.g. Gaussian, frequency

conjectured to be dual to M-theory on AdS4\times (S^7/Z_k) background. We point
out that the so-called orbifold equivalence on the gravity side, combined with
the AdS4/CFT3 duality, predicts a hitherto unknown type of duality on the gauge
theory side. It establishes the equivalence between a class of observables,
which are not necessarily protected by supersymmetry, in strongly coupled ABJM
theories away from the planar approximation, with different values of k and N
but sharing common kN. This limit is vastly different from the planar limit,
and hence from the gauge theory point of view the duality is more difficult to
explain compared to the previously known analogous equivalence between planar
gauge theories, where one can explicitly prove the equivalence diagrammatically
using the dominance of the planar diagrams.

certain Lie brackets of the vector fields of the extremum seeking system. It
turns out that the Lie bracket system directly reveals the optimizing behavior

Variables (LPVs), known to follow sequences in the period-luminosity diagram,
include long secondary period variables whose variability origin is still a
matter of debate.
  Aims.We use the 856 864 variable stars available from the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) in the EROS-2 database to detect, classify and characterize LPVs.
  Methods. Our method to extract LPVs is based on the statistical Abbe test. It
investigates the regularity of the light curve with respect to the survey
duration in order to extract candidates with long-term variability. The period
search is done by Deeming, Lomb-Scargle and generalized Lomb-Scargle methods,
combined with Fourier series fit. Color-magnitude, period-magnitude and
period-amplitude diagrams are used to characterize our candidates.
  Results. We present a catalog of 43 551 LPV candidates for the Large
Magellanic Cloud. For each of them, we provide up to five periods, mean
magnitude in EROS-2, 2MASS and Spitzer bands, BE-RE color, RE amplitude and
spectral type.We use infrared data to make the distinction between RGB, O-rich,
C-rich and extreme AGB stars. Properties of our LPV candidates are investigated
by analyzing period-luminosity and period-amplitude diagrams.

SiO, etc, has been also detected. Wide profiles showing sometimes spectacular
line wings have been found. We have mainly studied the excitation properties of
the high-velocity emission, which is known to come from fast bipolar outflows.
From comparison with general theoretical predictions, we find that CRL 618
shows a particularly warm fast wind, with characteristic kinetic temperature Tk
>~ 200 K. In contrast, the fast winds in OH 231.8+4.2 and NGC 6302 are cold, Tk
~ 30 K. Other nebulae, like CRL 2688, show intermediate temperatures, with
characteristic values around 100 K. We also discuss how the complex structure
of the nebulae can affect our estimates, considering two-component models. We
argue that the differences in temperature in the different nebulae can be due
to cooling after the gas acceleration (that is probably due to shocks); for
instance, CRL 618 is a case of very recent acceleration, less than ~ 100 yr
ago, while the fast gas in OH 231.8+4.2 was accelerated ~ 1000 yr ago. We also
find indications that the densest gas tends to be cooler, which may be
explained by the expected increase of the radiative cooling efficiency with the
density.

values of polarization and polarization angles due to the dust layers are found
to increase systematically with distance. We show that polarimetry in
combination with the (U - B) - (B - V) colour-colour diagram yields a better

the polarization due the intra-cluster medium is \sim 2.2 per cent. An
anomalous reddening law exists for the cluster region, indicating a relatively
larger grain size than that in the diffuse ISM. The spatial variation of the
polarization and E(B - V) is found to increase with radial distance from the
cluster center, whereas the {\theta}v and {\lambda}max are found to decrease
with increasing radial distance from the cluster center. About 40 per cent of
cluster members show the signatures of either intrinsic polarization or
rotation in their polarization angles. There is an indication that the star
light of the cluster members might have been depolarized because of non-uniform
alignment of dust grains in the foreground dust layers and in the intra-cluster

evolution. We examine in particular the changes of the mechanical and thermal
equilibrium of rotating stars. An important (predicted and observed) effect is
that rotating stars are hotter at the poles and cooler at the equator. We
briefly discuss the mass loss by stellar winds, which are influenced by the
anisotropic temperature distribution. These anisotropies in the interior are
also driving circulation currents, which transports the chemical elements and
the angular momentum in stars. Internal differential rotation, if present,
creates instabilities and mixing, in particular the shear mixing, the
horizontal turbulence and their interactions. A major check of the model
predictions concerns the changes of the surface abundances, which are modified
by mass loss in the very massive stars and by rotational mixing in O- and
B-type stars. We show that the observations confirm the existence of rotational
mixing, with much larger effects at lower metallicities. We discuss the
predictions of stellar models concerning the evolution of the surface
velocities, the evolutionary tracks in the HR diagram and lifetimes, the
populations of blue, red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, and the progenitors
of type Ibc supernovae. We show, that in many aspects, rotating models provide
a much better fit than non-rotating ones. Using the same physical ingredients
as those which fit the best the observations of stars at near solar
metallicities, we explore the consequences of rotating models for the status of
Be stars, the progenitors of Gamma Ray Bursts, the evolution of Pop III stars
and of very metal poor stars, the early chemical evolution of galaxies, the
origin of the C-enhanced Metal Poor stars (CEMP) and of the chemical anomalies
in globular clusters.

images which cannot be modelled by a simple axisymmetric disc. We show that a
large-scale anticyclonic vortex that develops where the viscosity has a large
gradient (e.g., at the edge of the disc dead zone), might be accountable for
these large-scale asymmetries. We modelled the long-term evolution of vortices
being triggered by the Rossby wave instability. We found that a
horseshoe-shaped (azimuthal wavenumber m=1) large-scale vortex forms by
coalescing of smaller vortices within 5x10^4 yr, and can survive on the disc
life-time (~5x10^6 yr), depending on the magnitude of global viscosity and the
thickness of the viscosity gradient. The two-dimensional grid-based global disc
simulations with local isothermal approximation and compressible-gas model have
been done by the GPU version of hydrodynamic code FARGO (GFARGO). To calculate
the dust continuum image at submillimetre wavelengths, we combined our
hydrodynamical results with a 3D radiative transfer code. By the striking
similarities of the calculated and observed submillimetre images, we suggest
that the three transition discs can be modelled by a disc possessing a
large-scale vortex formed near the disc dead zone edge. Since the larger dust
grains (larger than mm in size) are collected in these vortices, the
non-axisymmetric submillimetre images of the above transition discs might be
interpreted as active planet and planetesimal forming regions situated far (>

paper defines {\em bilinear games}, and proposes efficient algorithms for its
rank based subclasses. Bilinear games are two-player non-cooperative
single-shot games with compact polytopal strategy sets and two payoff matrices
(A,B) such that when (x,y) is the played strategy profile, the payoffs of the
players are xAy and xBy respectively. We show that bilinear games are very
general and capture many interesting classes of games like bimatrix games, two
player Bayesian games, polymatrix games, two-player extensive form games with
perfect recall etc. as special cases, and hence are hard to solve in general.
  Existence of a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium for (symmetric) bilinear games
follow directly from the known results. For a given bilinear game, we define
its {\em Best Response Polytopes} (BRPs) and characterize the set of Nash
equilibria as {\em fully-labeled} pairs in the BRPs. We consider a rank based
hierarchy of bilinear games, where rank of a game (A,B) is defined as
rank(A+B). In this paper, we give polynomial time algorithms to compute Nash
equilibrium for special classes of bilinear games:
  (i) Rank-1 games (i.e., rank(A+B)=1). (ii) FPTAS for constant rank games
(i.e., rank(A+B) is constant). (iii) When rank(A) or rank(B) is constant. This
improves the results by Lipton et al. (EC'03) and Kannan et al. (ET'09), for
bimatrix games with low rank matrices.

illumination with coherent light (laser). In shearing interferometry the
difference of the out of-plane displacement in two neighboring object points is

fringes, the method is suited for localization of strain concentrations and is

the advantage over conventional out-of-plane displacement-sensitive
interferometry that only a single difference of the unwrapped phase map is
required to obtain flexural strains, thereby relieving problems with noise and

study the properties of galaxies in these clusters and the ICM and, further, to
cross-check the reliability of the various mass estimates. This will help to
clarify the process of structure formation and how distant clusters may be used
to constrain cosmology. AIMS: We present a 84 ks Chandra observation of
IRC-0218A, a cluster of galaxies inferred by the presence of a galaxy
overdensity in the infrared at a redshift of 1.62 and associated with some XMM
emission Methods: Spatial analysis of the Chandra X-ray photon distribution.
Results: The Chandra observation of IRC-0218A appears to be entirely dominated
by a point-source located at the centroid of the MIR galaxy density. In
addition, we detect weak extended emission (2.3 sigma) out to a radius of 25""
with a flux of ~ 3 10E-15 erg/s/cm2 in the [0.3-2]keV band. Assuming that
clusters evolve similarly, we infer a virial mass of M200 =7.7+/-3.8 10E13Mo.
This is marginally compatible with our current estimate of the cluster
dynamical mass (based on 10 redshifts), although there is no evidence that the
galaxy peculiar velocities correspond to the motions of a virialized structure.
The stellar mass enclosed in the inferred X-ray virial radius is estimated to
1-2 10E12 Mo. We provide a detailed account of 28 X-ray point-sources detected
in the field.

derived from optical spectroscopy. We considered the spectra of nearby (z<0.1)
galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The equivalent width (EW)
distribution of the [O III]5007 emission line is strongly clustered around ~0.6
A, extending the validity of the results we obtained for red giant ellipticals.
The close connection between emission lines and stellar continuum points to
stellar processes as the most likely source of the bulk of the ionizing photons
in these galaxies although their emission line ratios are similar to those of
active nuclei. Genuine AGN might be sought mainly among the minority (~5-10%)
of outliers, i.e., galaxies with EW>~2 A. The galaxies located in the AGN
region of the spectroscopic diagnostic diagrams outnumber outliers by a factor
5-10 which casts doubts on the accuracy of the current identification of active
galaxies, particularly those of LINERs of low line luminosity, <~ 10^39-10^40
erg/s. This conclusion can be tested by using spectra that covers smaller
physical regions such as those that are already available in the literature of
the ~500 nearest bright galaxies, with a stellar continuum reduced by a factor
of 20-100 with respect to SDSS galaxies. If the emission lines were mainly of
AGN origin, their contrast against the continuum should be enhanced. Instead,
their EW distribution is similar to that of the SDSS sample, with just an
increase of the outlier fraction. We conclude that the number low-luminosity
AGN is currently largely overestimated with a sample purity as low as ~10%. As
a consequence the properties of low-luminosity AGN should be fundamentally
revised.

practical upper bound for the risk of contagion when the actual network

suggesting some kind of synchronisation phenomenon. Here, we identify the type
of such synchronisation and explore systematically its uniqueness and
robustness using a simple paleoclimate model akin to the van der Pol relaxation
oscillator and dynamical system theory. As the insolation is quite a complex
quasiperiodic signal involving different frequencies, the traditional concepts
used to define synchronisation to periodic forcing are no longer applicable.
Instead, we explore a different concept of generalised synchronisation in terms
of (coexisting) synchronised solutions for the forced system, their basins of
attraction and instabilities. We propose a clustering technique to compute the
number of synchronised solutions, each of which corresponds to a different
paleoclimate history. In this way, we uncover multistable synchronisation
(reminiscent of phase- or frequency-locking to individual periodic components
of astronomical forcing) at low forcing strength, and monostable or unique
synchronisation at stronger forcing. In the multistable regime, different
initial conditions may lead to different paleoclimate histories. To study their
robustness, we analyse Lyapunov exponents that quantify the rate of convergence
towards each synchronised solution (local stability), and basins of attraction
that indicate critical levels of external perturbations (global stability). We
find that even though synchronised solutions are stable on a long term, there
exist short episodes of desynchronisation where nearby climate trajectories
diverge temporarily (for about 50 kyr). (...)

theory. Firstly, we consider several aspects relating to the dynamics of the
swimming particle. We extend established analytical formulae to describe small
swimmers, which interact with their environment on a finite lengthscale. Solute
convection is also taken into account. Modeling of the chemical reaction
reveals a coupling between the angular distribution of reactivity on the
swimmer and the concentration field. This effect, which we term ""reaction
induced concentration distortion"", strongly influences the particle speed.
Building on these insights, we employ irreversible, linear thermodynamics to
formulate an energy balance. This approach highlights the importance of solute
convection for a consistent treatment of the energetics. The efficiency of
swimming is calculated numerically and approximated analytically. Finally, we
define an efficiency of transport for swimmers which are moving in random
directions. It is shown that this efficiency scales as the inverse of the
macroscopic distance over which transport is to occur.

regularization when solving linear inverse problems. Most of previous works in
the literature have mainly focused on the sparse synthesis prior where the
sparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the
signal from a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis
regularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and
the atoms in the dictionary, where these correlations define the analysis
support. The corresponding variational problem encompasses several well-known
regularizations such as the discrete total variation and the Fused Lasso. Our
main contributions consist in deriving sufficient conditions that guarantee
exact or partial analysis support recovery of the true signal in presence of
noise. More precisely, we give a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal
is the unique solution of the L1-analysis regularization in the noiseless case.
The same condition also guarantees exact analysis support recovery and
L2-robustness of the L1-analysis minimizer vis-a-vis an enough small noise in
the measurements. This condition turns to be sharp for the robustness of the
analysis support. To show partial support recovery and L2-robustness to an
arbitrary bounded noise, we introduce a stronger sufficient condition. When
specialized to the L1-synthesis regularization, our results recover some
corresponding recovery and robustness guarantees previously known in the
literature. From this perspective, our work is a generalization of these
results. We finally illustrate these theoretical findings on several examples
to study the robustness of the 1-D total variation and Fused Lasso
regularizations.

at every wavelength, remove the host galaxy and dust, reconstruct the AGN
spectral energy distribution and integrate to determine the intrinsic emission

limitations and our own galaxy line of sight obscuration. We have then to infer
the bolometric luminosity from spectral measurements made in discontinuous
wavebands and at different epochs. In this paper we tackle this issue by
exploring different methods to determine the bolometric luminosity. We first
explore the trend of accretion efficiency with black hole mass (efficiency
proportional to M^{\sim 0.5}) found in recent work by Davis & Laor and discuss
why this is most likely an artefact of the parameter space covered by their PG
quasar sample. We then target small samples of AGN at different redshifts,
luminosities and black hole masses to investigate the possible methods to
calculate the accretion efficiency. For these sources we are able to determine
the mass accretion rate and, with some assumptions, the accretion efficiency
distributions. Even though we select the sources for which we are able to
determine the parameters more accurately, there are still factors affecting the
measurements that are hard to constrain. We suggest methods to overcome these
problems based on contemporaneous multi-wavelength data measurements and

where Alfv\'en QPOs are mainly confined to the core of the neutron star and the
crustal shear modes are damped very efficiently; and (c) a strong field regime

the behavior of purely Alfv\'en QPOs. When the Alfv\'en QPOs are confined to
the core of the neutron star, we find qualitatively similar QPOs as in the
absence of a crust. The lower QPOs associated with the closed field lines of

lines are displaced from the polar axis. Additionally, we observe a family of

matter. There could be a non-gravitational interaction in the dark sector,
leading to changes in the effective DE equation of state, in the redshift
dependence of the DM density and in structure formation. We use CMB, BAO and
SNIa data to constrain a model where the energy transfer in the dark sector is
proportional to the DE density. There are two subclasses, defined by the
vanishing of momentum transfer either in the DM or the DE frame. We conduct a
Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo analysis to obtain best-fit parameters. The background
evolution allows large interaction strengths, and the constraints from CMB
anisotropies are weak. The growth of DM density perturbations is much more
sensitive to the interaction, and can deviate strongly from the standard case.
However, the deviations are degenerate with galaxy bias and thus more difficult
to constrain. Interestingly, the ISW signature is suppressed since the
non-standard background evolution can compensate for high growth rates. We also
discuss the partial degeneracy between interacting DE and modified gravity, and
how this can be broken.

from the chemical and kinematical properties of its stars. The analysis of
current large spectroscopic surveys (thousands of stars) and future ones
(millions of stars) require automated analysis techniques to obtain robust
estimates of the stellar parameters. Several on-going and planned spectroscopic
surveys have selected their wavelength region to contain the IR CaII triplet
and this paper focuses on the automatic analysis of such spectra.
  We investigated two algorithms, MATISSE and DEGAS, both of which compare the
observed spectrum to a grid of synthetic spectra, but each uses a different
mathematical approach for finding the optimum match and hence the best stellar
parameters.
  We identified degeneracies in different regions of the HR diagram: hot dwarfs
and giants share the same spectral signatures. Furthermore, the surface gravity
of cooler dwarfs is difficult to determine accurately. These effects are
intensified when the information decreases (e.g. metal-poor stars or low SNR
spectra). Our results show that the local projection method MATISSE is
preferred for high SNR spectra, whereas the decision-tree method DEGAS is
preferred for noisier spectra. We therefore propose a hybrid approach of both
methods and show that sufficiently accurate results for the purposes of
galactic archaeology are retrieved down to SNR~20 for typical thin or thick
disc stars, and down to SNR~50 for the more metal-poor halo giants.
  If unappreciated, degeneracies in stellar parameters can introduce biases in
derived quantities for target stars such as distances and full space motions.
These biases can be minimised using the knowledge gained by thorough testing of
the proposed algorithm, which in turn lead to robust automated methods for the
coming extensive stellar spectroscopic surveys in the Local Group.

neutrino phenomenology of the OPERA experiment may be due to an environmental
feature of the Earth, naturally yielding a long-range fifth force of
gravitational origin whose coupling with the neutrino is set by the scale M_*,
in units of reduced Planck mass. Its characteristic length lambda should not be
smaller than one Earth's radius R_e, while its upper bound is expected to be
slightly smaller than the Earth-Moon distance (60 R_e). We analytically work
out some orbital effects of a Yukawa-type fifth force for a test particle
moving in the modified field of a central body. Our results are quite general
since they are not restricted to any particular size of lambda; moreover, they
are valid for an arbitrary orbital configuration of the particle, i.e. for any
value of its eccentricity $e$. We find that the dimensionless strength coupling
parameter alpha is constrained to |alpha| <= 1 10^-10-4 10^-9 for 1 R_e <=
lambda <= 10 R_e by the laser data of the Earth's artificial satellite LAGEOS
II, corresponding to M_* >= 4 10^9 -1.6 10^10. The Moon perigee allows to
obtain |alpha| <= 3 10^-11 for the Earth-Moon pair in the range 15 R_e <=
lambda <= 60 R_e, which translates as M_* >= 3 10^10 - 4.5 10^10. Our results
are neither necessarily limited to the superluminal OPERA scenario nor to the
Dvali-Vikman model, in which it is M_* = 10^-6 at lambda = 1 R_e, in contrast
with our bounds: they generally extend to any theoretical scenario implying a
fifth-force of Yukawa-type.

particular, the atomic blockade phenomenon occurs when the induced long-range
interaction effectively suppresses the double atomic excitation, when the
average photon number takes certain values, which makes the two nearest energy
levels degenerate. We also show that quantum phase transitions occur in the
indirectly-interacting atomic ensemble when the average photon number reaches
several critical points. In this sense, the quantum statistical properties of
the collective excitations are very sensitive to the change of the average
photon number. Our model exhibits quantum phase transitions similar to the ones

below the resolution level of the observations. Including a previously measured
temperature profile of IRAS 4A leads to a more realistic morphology and
intensity distribution. We also show that ALMA has the capability of
distinguishing among the three different models adopted in this work. Our
results are consistent with the standard theoretical scenario for the formation
of low-mass stars, where clouds initially threaded by large-scale magnetic
fields become unstable and collapse, trapping the field in the nascent
protostar and the surrounding circumstellar disk. In the collapsing cloud, the
dynamics is dominated by gravitational and magnetic forces.

variability event, with one knot (HST-1) increasing by over a factor 100 in
brightness. Variability was also seen on timescales of months in the nuclear
flux. Here we discuss the optical-UV polarization and spectral variability of
these components, which show vastly different behavior. HST-1 shows a highly
significant correlation between flux and polarization, with P increasing from
$\sim 20%$ at minimum to >40% at maximum, while the orientation of its electric
vector stayed constant. HST-1's optical-UV spectrum is very hard
($\alpha_{UV-O}\sim0.5$, $F_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$), and displays ""hard lags""
during epochs 2004.9-2005.5, including the peak of the flare, with soft lags at
later epochs. We interpret the behavior of HST-1 as enhanced particle
acceleration in a shock, with cooling from both particle aging and the
relaxation of the compression. We set 2$\sigma$ upper limits of $0.5 \delta$
parsecs and 1.02$c$ on the size and advance speed of the flaring region. The
slight deviation of the electric vector orientation from the jet PA, makes it
likely that on smaller scales the flaring region has either a double or twisted
structure. By contrast, the nucleus displays much more rapid variability, with
a highly variable electric vector orientation and 'looping' in the $(I,P)$
plane. The nucleus has a much steeper spectrum ($\alpha_{UV-O} \sim 1.5$) but
does not show UV-optical spectral variability. Its behavior can be interpreted
as either a helical distortion to a steady jet or a shock propagating through a
helical jet.

routing protocol that has energy efficiency. Since the power of the sensor
Nodes are limited, conserving energy and network life is a critical issue in
wireless sensor network. Clustering is one of the known methods widely used to
face these challenges. In this paper, a cluster based communication protocol
with considering the low energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, is
introduced which balances the energy load among sensor nodes. The nodes close
to each other have more overlap; they sense the same data from environment and
cause a waste of energy by generating repetitive data. In this paper, a cluster
based routing protocol is introduced, in the proposed protocol, in each round a
certain number of nodes are specified; the nodes which have at least one
neighboring node at a distance less than the threshold. Then, among them the
nodes with less energy and greater overlap with their neighbors have been
chosen to go to sleep mode, Also, the energy imbalance among sensor nodes is
reduced by integrating the distance of the nodes from the base station into
clustering policies.

($f(r_h)=0$ for $r_h>0$) for the black hole solution in noncommutative space,
