the first neighbour connections exist and the average degree is four per node.
In the random model A, the second neighbour connections are rewired with a

$P(l) \propto l^{-\alpha}$. We find that for both models, the dynamics leads to
freezing such that the system gets locked in a disordered state. The point at
which the disorder of the nonequilibrium steady state is maximum is located.
Behaviour of dynamical quantities like residual energy, order parameter and
persistence are discussed and compared. Overall, the behaviour of physical
quantities are similar although subtle differences are observed due to the

galaxy dynamical and effective masses. We verify the tightness of the MBH-sigma

tighter trends. We do not find differences in the MBH-sigma relation of barred

and has a different slope than that involving classical bulges. The MBH-bulge
mass is not as tight as the MBH-sigma relation, despite the bulge mass proving
to be a better proxy of MBH than bulge luminosity. We find a rather poor
correlation between MBH and Sersic index suggesting that MBH is not related to
the bulge light concentration. The correlations between MBH and galaxy
luminosity or mass are not a marked improvement over the MBH sigma relation. If
Vc is a proxy for the dark matter halo mass, the large scatter of the MBH-Vc
relation then suggests that MBH is more coupled to the baryonic rather than the
dark matter. We have tested the need for a third parameter in the MBH scaling
relations, through various linear correlations with bulge and galaxy
parameters, only to confirm that the fundamental plane of the SMBH is mainly

  In this paper, we present a focused sequent calculus for propositional
intuitionistic logic and prove the focalization property relative to a standard
presentation of propositional intuitionistic logic. Compared to existing
approaches, the proof is quite concise, depending only on the internal
soundness and completeness of the focused logic. In turn, both of these
properties can be established (and mechanically verified) by structural
induction in the style of Pfenning's structural cut elimination without the
need for any tedious and repetitious invertibility lemmas. The proof of cut

submillimetre-selected galaxies in Herschel-ATLAS, classified by optical
morphology. The early-type galaxies (ETGs) that are detected contain as much
dust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindly
selected at submillimetre wavelengths.
  Comparing H-ATLAS galaxies to a control sample of optically selected
galaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous ETGs are detected in H-ATLAS. The H-ATLAS
ETGs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7
Msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 Msun. This is
comparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude more
dust than that found for the control ETGs, which have a median dust mass
inferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 Msun. The ETGs detected in H-ATLAS
have bluer NUV-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and younger
stellar populations than ETGs which are optically selected, and may be
transitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. We also find that
H-ATLAS and control ETGs inhabit similar low-density environments. We conclude
that the dust in H-ATLAS and control ETGs cannot be solely from stellar
sources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ISM or external
sources is required. Alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient as
predicted.
  We also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in our
sample with SSFR<10^-11/yr. We find these passive spirals have lower
dust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar population
ages than normal spirals. The passive spirals inhabit low density environments
similar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. This shows that
the processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in the
intermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts. (Abridged)

that are attached to combinatorial objects. Any graph $G$ has an associated
reciprocal polynomial $R_G$, and with two particular classes of reciprocal
polynomials in mind one can ask the questions: (a) when is $R_G$ a product of
cyclotomic polynomials (giving the cyclotomic graphs)? (b) when does $R_G$ have
the minimal polynomial of a Salem number as its only non-cyclotomic factor (the
non-trival Salem graphs)? Cyclotomic graphs were classified by Smith in 1970.
Salem graphs are `spectrally close' to being cyclotomic, in that nearly all
their eigenvalues are in the critical interval [-2,2]. On the other hand Salem
graphs do not need to be `combinatorially close' to being cyclotomic: the
largest cyclotomic induced subgraph might be comparatively tiny.
  We define an $m$-Salem graph to be a connected Salem graph $G$ for which $m$
is minimal such that there exists an induced cyclotomic subgraph of $G$ that
has $m$ fewer vertices than $G$. The 1-Salem subgraphs are both spectrally
close and combinatorially close to being cyclotomic. Moreover, every Salem
graph contains a 1-Salem graph as an induced subgraph, so these 1-Salem graphs
provide some necessary substructure of all Salem graphs. The main result of
this paper is a complete combinatorial description of all 1-Salem graphs: there
are 26 infinite families and 383 sporadic examples.

  Real Roots of a Polynomial",,,,,"cs.SC cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new algorithm denoted DSC2 to isolate the real roots of a
univariate square-free polynomial f with integer coefficients. The algorithm
iteratively subdivides an initial interval which is known to contain all real
roots of f. The main novelty of our approach is that we combine Descartes' Rule
of Signs and Newton iteration. More precisely, instead of using a fixed
subdivision strategy such as bisection in each iteration, a Newton step based
on the number of sign variations for an actual interval is considered, and,
only if the Newton step fails, we fall back to bisection. Following this
approach, our analysis shows that, for most iterations, we can achieve
quadratic convergence towards the real roots. In terms of complexity, our
method induces a recursion tree of almost optimal size O(nlog(n tau)), where n
denotes the degree of the polynomial and tau the bitsize of its coefficients.
The latter bound constitutes an improvement by a factor of tau upon all
existing subdivision methods for the task of isolating the real roots. In
addition, we provide a bit complexity analysis showing that DSC2 needs only
\tilde{O}(n^3tau) bit operations to isolate all real roots of f. This matches
the best bound known for this fundamental problem. However, in comparison to
the much more involved algorithms by Pan and Sch\""onhage (for the task of
isolating all complex roots) which achieve the same bit complexity, DSC2
focuses on real root isolation, is very easy to access and easy to implement.

clustered and/or heavily confused. Photometric redshifts and star formation
rates (SFRs) are derived by analyzing UV-to-optical and IR-to-radio SEDs. The
median redshift of z~2.6 is similar to other earlier estimates, but we show
that 80% of the AzTEC-GOODS sources are at z>2, with a significant high
redshift tail (20% at z>3.3). Rest-frame UV and optical properties of AzTEC
sources are extremely diverse, spanning 10 magnitude in the i- and K-band
photometry with median values of i=25.3 and K=22.6 and a broad range of red
colour (i-K=0-6). These AzTEC sources are some of the most luminous galaxies in
the rest-frame optical bands at z>2, with inferred stellar masses of (1-30) x
10^{10} solar masses and UV-derived star formation rates of SFR(UV) > 10-1000
solar masses per year. The IR-derived SFR, 200-2000 solar masses per year, is
independent of redshift or stellar mass. The resulting specific star formation
rates, SSFR = 1-100 per Gyr, are 10-100 times higher than similar mass galaxies
at z=0, and they extend the previously observed rapid rise in the SSFR with
redshift to z=2-5. These galaxies have a SFR high enough to have built up their
entire stellar mass within their Hubble time. We find only marginal evidence
for an AGN contribution to the near-IR and mid-IR SEDs. (abridged)

to trace the disk and the halo of the nearby giant spiral galaxy M31. We
analyzed the temperature excess in three WMAP bands (W, V, and Q) by dividing

studied the robustness of the detected temperature excess by considering 500
random control fields in the real WMAP maps and simulating 500 sky maps from
the best-fitted cosmological parameters. By comparing the obtained temperature
contrast profiles with the real ones towards the M31 galaxy, we find that the
temperature asymmetry in the M31 disk is fairly robust, while the effect in the
halo is weaker. An asymmetry in the mean microwave temperature in the M31 disk
along the direction of the M31 rotation is observed with a temperature contrast
up to about 130 microK/pixel. We also find a temperature asymmetry in the M31
halo, which is much weaker than for the disk, up to a galactocentric distance
of about 10 degrees (120 kpc) with a peak temperature contrast of about 40
microK/pixel. Although the confidence level of the signal is not high, if
estimated purely statistically, which could be expected due to the weakness of
the effect, the geometrical structure of the temperature asymmetry points
towards a definite effect modulated by the rotation of the M31 halo. This
result might open a new way to probe these relatively less studied galactic

fluids. In order to investigate these conditions we have performed
high-resolution three-dimensional numerical simulations of relativistic
magneto-hydrodynamical (RMHD) turbulence. We find that magnetic energy is
amplified to several percent of the total energy density by turbulent twisting
and folding of magnetic field lines. Values of epsilon_B near 1% are thus
naturally expected. We study the dependence of saturated magnetic field energy
fraction as a function of Mach number and relativistic temperature. We then
present power spectra of the turbulent kinetic and magnetic energies. We also
present solenoidal (curl-like) and dilatational (divergence-like) power spectra
of kinetic energy. We propose that relativistic effects introduce novel
couplings between these spectral components. The case we explore in most detail
is for equal amounts of thermal and rest mass energy, corresponding to
conditions after collisions of shells with relative Lorentz factors of several.
These conditions are relevant in models for internal shocks, for the late
afterglow phase, for cocoon material along the edge of a relativistic jet as it
propagates through a star, as well neutron stars merging with each other and
with black hole companions. We find that relativistic turbulence decays
extremely quickly, on a sound crossing time of an eddy. Models invoking
sustained relativistic turbulence to explain variability in GRB prompt emission
are thus strongly disfavored unless a persistant driving of the turbulence is
maintained for the duration of the prompt emission.

eccentricity and low maximum height above the Galactic plane has been
identified. From their kinematics, it was suggested that the inner disk is
their most probable birthplace. Their chemical imprints may therefore reveal
important information about the formation and evolution of the still poorly
understood inner disk. To probe the formation history of these stellar
populations, a detailed analysis of a sample of very metal-rich stars is
carried out. We derive the metallicities, abundances of \alpha\ elements, ages,
and Galactic orbits. The analysis of 71 metal-rich stars is based on optical
high-resolution \'echelle spectra obtained with the FEROS spectrograph at the
ESO 1.52-m Telescope at La Silla, Chile. The metallicities and abundances of C,
O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti were derived based on LTE detailed analysis, employing
the MARCS model atmospheres. We confirm the high metallicity of these stars
reaching up to [Fe I/H]~0.58, and the sample of metal-rich dwarfs can be
kinematically subclassified in samples of thick disk, thin disk, and
intermediate stellar populations. All sample stars show solar \alpha-Fe ratios,
and most of them are old and still quite metal rich. The orbits suggest that
the thin disk, thick disk and intermediate populations were formed at
Galactocentric distances of ~8 kpc, ~6 kpc, and ~7 kpc, respectively. The mean
maximum height of the thick disk subsample of Z_max~380 pc, is lower than for
typical thick disk stars. A comparison of \alpha-element abundances of the
sample stars with bulge stars shows that the oxygen is compatible with a bulge
or inner thick disk origin. Our results suggest that models of radial mixing
and dynamical effects of the bar and bar/spiral arms might explain the presence
of these old metal-rich dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood.

in a previous result by MINOS, raises the question of a possible strong
violation of standard relativity. In particular, the particles of the standard
model would have different critical speeds in vacuum, and such differences
would be measurable with nowadays facilities. Although several experimental and
phenomenological issues remain open, the situation deserves been studied
closely from a theoretical point of view. The data cannot be explained by
conventional extrapolations of Planck-scale Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV)
patterns. But, as already stressed in our previous papers since 1995, a weak
mixing of standard particles with superbradyons (particles with positive mass
and energy, and a critical speed in vacuum much larger than the speed of light)
can explain such an effect. Superbradyons can be the ultimate constituents of
matter (superluminal preons), but they may simultaneously exist in our Universe
as free particles just as light can cross a transparent material medium. In
this case, a direct mixing between superbradyons and the particles of the
standard model would be unavoidable. After briefly examining the experimental
situation and the problems it may raise, we comment on the possibility of a
superbradyonic mixing, as well as on the implications of a spinorial
description of space-time where space translations would form a SU(2) compact

and post-selected (PPS) quantum measurements, as well as weak values, and
afterwards presents original work. In particular, we develop a nonperturbative
theory of weak PPS measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter,
for arbitrary initial states. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained
for the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable, which hold
to all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in
addition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to
describe weak PPS measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the
generalized Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new
regimes of weak PPS measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the
inverted region, where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer
deflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal
conditions for weak PPS measurements are achieved in the strongly-nonlinear
regime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close
to the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being
typically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. We show that the
amplification in the weak PPS measurements is a product of two qualitatively
different quantities: proper amplification and enhancement. The effects of the
free system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also identify optimal
meters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class
of the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical
calculations, the results of which agree with the theory. Moreover, the theory
is extended to allow for a completely general post-selection measurement. We
also discuss time-symmetry properties of PPS measurements of any strength.

primary and its red optical (Pan-STARRS1) and blue infrared (2MASS) colors. It
has a projected separation of 1630 AU and a near-infrared spectral type of
T4.5. As such it is one of only three known companions to a main sequence star
which have early/mid-T spectral types (the others being HN Peg B and eps Indi

900{+1900,-600} Myr. This value is also in agreement with the age derived from
the star's weak ROSAT detection. Comparison with evolutionary models for this
age range indicates that HIP 38939B falls in the mass range 38+/-20 Mjup with
an effective temperature range of 1090+/-60 K. Fitting our spectrum with
atmospheric models gives a best fitting temperature of 1100 K. We include our

deposition during the recombination era with arbitrary redshift dependence. Our
approach also provides more rigorous and model-independent bounds on dark
matter annihilation and decay scenarios. We employ principal component analysis
to identify a basis of weighting functions for the energy deposition. The

deposition histories that are currently allowed by WMAP7 data, up to 3
principal component coefficients are measurable by Planck and up to 5

physical extent of 2.6 kpc. A model assuming truncation of an otherwise
constant SFH gives a formation epoch zF~10, with a truncation after 2.7 Gyr,
giving a mass-weighted age of 1.5 Gyr and a stellar mass of 0.8-3E11Msun,
implying star formation rates of 30-110 Msun/yr. A more complex model including
a recent burst of star formation places the age of the youngest component at
145 Myr, with a mass contribution lower than 20%, and a maximum amount of dust
reddening of E(B-V)<0.4 mag (95% confidence levels). This low level of dust
reddening is consistent with the low emission observed at 24 micron,
corresponding to rest-frame 8 micron, where PAH emission should contribute
significantly if a strong formation episode were present. The colour profile of
FW4871 does not suggest a significant radial trend in the properties of the

compared extensively in the literature, although differing techniques are often
used to define environment. Most methods fall into two broad groups: those that
use nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that use
fixed apertures. The differences between the two inhibit a clean comparison
between analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data,
different properties are actually being measured. In this work we apply twenty
published environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrained
to look like the local Universe. We find that nearest neighbour-based measures
best probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses the
inter-halo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local density
variations. The resulting correlation also shows that nearest neighbour galaxy
environment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. Conversely,
aperture-based methods that probe super-halo scales accurately identify
high-density regions corresponding to high mass haloes. Both methods show how
galaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of the
largest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the background
dark matter environment. We also warn against using photometric redshifts to
define environment in all but the densest regions. When considering environment
there are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measured
with nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo best
measured with apertures. This leads to the conclusion that there is no
universal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scale
being probed.

star's self-gravity, and can directly capture stars that cross its event
horizon. For black holes with mass M > 10^7 solar masses, tidal disruption of
main-sequence stars occurs close enough to the event horizon that a Newtonian
treatment of the tidal field is no longer valid. The fraction of stars that are
directly captured is also no longer negligible. We calculate generically
oriented stellar orbits in the Kerr metric, and evaluate the relativistic tidal
tensor at pericenter for those stars not directly captured by the black hole.
We combine this relativistic analysis with previous calculations of how these
orbits are populated to determine tidal-disruption rates for spinning black
holes. We find, consistent with previous results, that black-hole spin
increases the upper limit on the mass of a black hole capable of tidally
disrupting solar-like stars to ~7 x 10^8 solar masses. More quantitatively, we
find that direct stellar capture reduces tidal-disruption rates by a factor 2/3
(1/10) at M = 10^7 (10^8) solar masses. The strong dependence of
tidal-disruption rates on black-hole spin for M > 10^8 solar masses implies
that future surveys like LSST that discover thousands of tidal disruption

>~ 3.5 sigma, where sigma is the r.m.s. of the convergence kappa) are typically
dominated by a single massive halo. In contrast, medium-height peaks (~0.5-1.5
sigma) cannot be attributed to a single collapsed dark matter halo, and are
instead created by the projection of multiple (typically, 4-8) halos along the
line of sight, and by random galaxy shape noise. Nevertheless, these peaks
dominate the sensitivity to the cosmological parameters w, sigma_8, and
Omega_m. We find that the peak height distribution and its dependence on
cosmology differ significantly from predictions in a Gaussian random field. We
directly compute the marginalized errors on w, sigma_8, and Omega_m from the

and study the cosmological information content of MFs derived from these maps.
Our suite consists of 80 independent 512^3 N-body runs, covering seven
different cosmologies, varying three cosmological parameters Omega_m, w, and
sigma_8 one at a time, around a fiducial LambdaCDM model. In each cosmology, we
use ray-tracing to create a thousand pseudo-independent 12 deg^2 convergence
maps, and use these in a Monte Carlo procedure to estimate the joint confidence
contours on the above three parameters. We include redshift tomography at three
different source redshifts z_s=1, 1.5, 2, explore five different smoothing
scales theta_G=1, 2, 3, 5, 10 arcmin, and explicitly compare and combine the
MFs with the WL power spectrum. We find that the MFs capture a substantial
amount of information from non-Gaussian features of convergence maps, i.e.
beyond the power spectrum. The MFs are particularly well suited to break
degeneracies and to constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter w (by
a factor of ~ three better than from the power spectrum alone). The
non-Gaussian information derives partly from the one-point function of the
convergence (through V_0, the ""area"" MF), and partly through non-linear spatial
information (through combining different smoothing scales for V_0, and through
V_1 and V_2, the boundary length and genus MFs, respectively). In contrast to
the power spectrum, the best constraints from the MFs are obtained only when
multiple smoothing scales are combined.

luminosity of the ULX is a few times $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and in the
faintest state below the detection limit of $\sim4$ times $10^{39}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. The luminosity in the brightest state requires an accreting black
hole mass of at least 100 M$_{\odot}$ assuming isotropic emission. However it
is possible that the source is contaminated by X-ray emission from the nearby
supernova SN2009jf. In this case the luminosity of the ULX is in a range where
it is strongly debated whether it is a super-Eddington stellar mass black hole
or an intermediate mass black hole. The colours of the host cluster indicate a
young stellar population, with an age between 10 and 100 Myr. The total stellar
mass of the cluster is $\sim5\cdot10^{5}$M$_{\odot}$.

execution paths of dynamic systems. In the case of dynamic systems that allow
for nondeterministic evolutions, one has to specify, along with an LTL formula
f, which are the paths that are required to satisfy the formula. Two extreme
cases are the universal interpretation A.f, which requires that the formula be
satisfied for all execution paths, and the existential interpretation E.f,
which requires that the formula be satisfied for some execution path.
  When LTL is applied to the definition of goals in planning problems on
nondeterministic domains, these two extreme cases are too restrictive. It is
often impossible to develop plans that achieve the goal in all the
nondeterministic evolutions of a system, and it is too weak to require that the
goal is satisfied by some execution.
  In this paper we explore alternative interpretations of an LTL formula that
are between these extreme cases. We define a new language that permits an
arbitrary combination of the A and E quantifiers, thus allowing, for instance,
to require that each finite execution can be extended to an execution
satisfying an LTL formula (AE.f), or that there is some finite execution whose
extensions all satisfy an LTL formula (EA.f). We show that only eight of these
combinations of path quantifiers are relevant, corresponding to an alternation
of the quantifiers of length one (A and E), two (AE and EA), three (AEA and
EAE), and infinity ((AE)* and (EA)*). We also present a planning algorithm for

design under two network expansion models (random and gradual), comparing
incremental and optimized networks in terms of cost, topological similarity,
delay and robustness. We find that even though incremental design has some cost
overhead, that overhead does not increase as the network grows. Also, it is
less costly to evolve an existing network than to design it ""from scratch"" as

sublimation products (i.e., gas emission), finding an upper limit CN production
rate of Q_CN<6x10^23 mol/s, from which we infer an H2O production rate of
Q_H2O<10^26 mol/s. Numerical simulations indicate that P/La Sagra is
dynamically stable for >100 Myr, suggesting that it is likely native to its
current location and that its composition is likely representative of other
objects in the same region of the main belt, though the relatively close

that can magnify supernovae (SNe) occurring in background galaxies. We assess
the possibility to use lensed SNe to put constraints on the mass models of
galaxy clusters and the Hubble parameter at high redshift. Due to the standard
candle nature of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observational information on the
lensing magnification from an intervening galaxy cluster can be used to
constrain the model for the cluster mass distribution. A statistical analysis
using parametric cluster models was performed to investigate the possible
improvements from lensed SNe Ia for the accurately modeled galaxy cluster A1689
and the less well constrained cluster A2204. Time delay measurements obtained
from SNe lensed by accurately modeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure
the Hubble parameter. For a survey of A1689 we estimate the expected rate of
detectable SNe Ia and of multiply imaged SNe. The velocity dispersion and core
radius of the main cluster potential show strong correlations with the
predicted magnifications and can therefore be constrained by observations of
SNe Ia in background galaxies. This technique proves especially powerful for
galaxy clusters with only few known multiple image systems. The main
uncertainty for measurements of the Hubble parameter from the time delay of
strongly lensed SNe is due to cluster model uncertainties. For the extremely
well modeled cluster A1689, a single time delay measurement could be used to
determine the Hubble parameter with a precision of ~ 10%. We conclude that
observations of SNe Ia behind galaxy clusters can be used to improve the mass
modeling of the large scale component of galaxy clusters and thus the
distribution of dark matter. Time delays from SNe strongly lensed by accurately
modeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure the Hubble constant at high
redshifts.

furthermore consider these instabilities in the setting where fluid viscosity
varies in the transverse direction. It is found that the flow pattern strongly

the escape of ionizing photons. The cone morphology is narrow with an estimated

of the nuclear starburst can easily generate the radiation required to ionize
the cone. Although less likely, we cannot rule out the possibility of an
obscured AGN source. An echelle spectrum along the minor axis shows complex
kinematics that are consistent with outflow activity. The narrow morphology of

intensification of the global water cycle in the 20th century are also robust
results of coupled general circulation models. In spite of this success
model-to-model variability and biases that are small in first order climate
responses however, have implications for climate predictability especially when
multi-model means are used. We show that most climate simulations of 20th and
21st century A2 scenario performed with IPCC-AR4 models have deficiencies in
simulating the global atmospheric moisture balance. Large biases of only a few
models affect the multi-model mean global moisture budget and an imbalanced
flux of -0.14 Sv exists whereas the multi-model median imbalance is only -0.02
Sv. For most models, the detected imbalances furthermore change over time. As a
consequence, in 13 of the 18 IPCC-AR4 models examined, global annual mean
precipitation exceeds global evaporation, indicating that there should be a
""leaking"" of moisture from the atmosphere whereas for the remaining 5 models a
""flooding"" is implied. The source / sink of moisture can also be regarded as
atmospheric latent heating / cooling and hence as positive / negative
perturbations of the atmospheric energy budget or non-radiative forcings in the
range of -1 to +6 W/m2 (median is +0.1 W/m2). The global atmospheric moisture
transport from oceans to land areas, which impacts the terrestrial water cycle
also increases by about 5% with a model-to-model range from 1 to 13% in the
21st century. The variability is partially due to the different implementations
of aerosol forcings in the models. The assessment of the pole wards shifts of
dry zones in climate simulations show that the multi-model means of the two
subsets of leaking and flooding models produce spatial shifts similar in size
as expected from 21st century global warming simulations.

  Absorption Spectroscopy of Atmospheric Gas Mixtures","submitted to Journal of Scientific Computing",,,,"math.NA astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) is a powerful tool for
detecting and quantifying trace gases in atmospheric chemistry
\cite{Platt_Stutz08}. DOAS spectra consist of a linear combination of complex
multi-peak multi-scale structures. Most DOAS analysis routines in use today are
based on least squares techniques, for example, the approach developed in the
1970s uses polynomial fits to remove a slowly varying background, and known
reference spectra to retrieve the identity and concentrations of reference
gases. An open problem is to identify unknown gases in the fitting residuals
for complex atmospheric mixtures.
  In this work, we develop a novel three step semi-blind source separation
method. The first step uses a multi-resolution analysis to remove the
slow-varying and fast-varying components in the DOAS spectral data matrix $X$.
The second step decomposes the preprocessed data $\hat{X}$ in the first step
into a linear combination of the reference spectra plus a remainder, or
$\hat{X} = A\,S + R$, where columns of matrix $A$ are known reference spectra,
and the matrix $S$ contains the unknown non-negative coefficients that are
proportional to concentration. The second step is realized by a convex
minimization problem $S = \mathrm{arg} \min \mathrm{norm}\,(\hat{X} - A\,S)$,
where the norm is a hybrid $\ell_1/\ell_2$ norm (Huber estimator) that helps to
maintain the non-negativity of $S$. The third step performs a blind independent
component analysis of the remainder matrix $R$ to extract remnant gas
components. We first illustrate the proposed method in processing a set of DOAS
experimental data by a satisfactory blind extraction of an a-priori unknown
trace gas (ozone) from the remainder matrix. Numerical results also show that
the method can identify multiple trace gases from the residuals.

number of issues including CSI estimation, CSI feedback delay between user
terminals to base stations, and the time/frequency coherence of the channel.
The latter aspects of CSIT-feedback delay and channel-dynamics can lead to
significant challenges in the deployment of efficient MU-MIMO systems. Recently
it has been shown by Maddah-Ali and Tse (MAT) that degree of freedom gains can
be realized by MU-MIMO even when the knowledge of CSIT is completely outdated.
Specifically, outdated CSIT, albeit perfect CSIT, is known for transmissions
only after they have taken place. This aspect of insensitivity to CSIT-feedback
delay is of particular interest since it allows one to reconsider MU-MIMO
design in dynamic channel conditions. Indeed, as we show, with appropriate

the sign problem have been studied intensively, relation to QCD with a finite
baryon chemical potential was not clear. This paper introduces large-$N_c$
equivalences between QCD and various QCD-like theories. These equivalences lead
us to a unified viewpoint for QCD with baryon and isospin chemical potentials,
$SO(2N_c)$ and $Sp(2N_c)$ gauge theories, QCD with adjoint matters and
two-color QCD. In particular QCD with the baryon chemical potential is
large-$N_c$ equivalent to its phase quenched version in a certain parameter
region, which is relevant for heavy ion collision experiments. All previous
simulation results which study the effect of the phase confirm the phase quench
approximation is quantitatively good already at Nc=3; it is so good that often
two theories give the same value within error. Therefore the phase quenched
simulation is the best strategy for the QCD critical point search. At small
volume one can study a tiny 1/Nc effect by the phase reweighting; the large-Nc
equivalence guarantees that the phase reweighing method works without suffering

selection, but extracting this information for short, widely scattered
noncoding elements remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a new
computational method for addressing this problem called Inference of Natural
Selection from Interspersed Genomically coHerent elemenTs (INSIGHT). INSIGHT
uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and
divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites,
pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for
variation among loci in mutation rates and genealogical backgrounds. The method
is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and
positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism
and divergence. Information about divergence is obtained from multiple outgroup
genomes using a full phylogenetic model. The model is efficiently fitted to
genome-wide data by decomposing the maximum likelihood estimation procedure
into three straightforward stages. The key selection-related parameters are
estimated by expectation maximization. Using simulations, we show that INSIGHT
can accurately estimate several parameters of interest even in complex
demographic scenarios. We apply our methods to noncoding RNAs, promoter
regions, and transcription factor binding sites in the human genome, and find
clear evidence of natural selection. We also present a detailed analysis of
particular nucleotide positions within GATA2 binding sites and primary
micro-RNA transcripts.

of dust-driven wind around pulsating carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch
(C-rich AGB) stars in order to reveal not only the amount but also the size
distribution. Two cases are considered for the nucleation process; one is the
LTE case where the vibration temperature of SiC clusters $T_{\rm v}$ is equal
to the gas temperature as usual, and another is the non-LTE case in which
$T_{\rm v}$ is assumed to be the same as the temperature of small SiC grains.
The results of hydrodynamical calculations for a model with stellar parameters
of mass $M_{\ast}$=1.0 $M_{\odot}$, luminosity $L_{\ast}$=10$^{4}$ $L_{\odot}$,
effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$=2600 K, C/O ratio=1.4, and pulsation period
$P$=650 days show the followings: In the LTE case, SiC grains condense in
accelerated outflowing gas after the formation of carbon grains and the
resulting averaged mass ratio of SiC to carbon grains of $\sim$ 10$^{-8}$ is
too small to reproduce the value of 0.01-0.3 inferred from the radiative
transfer models. On the other hand, in the non-LTE case, the formation region
of SiC grains is inner than and/or almost identical to that of carbon grains
due to the so-called inverse greenhouse effect. The mass ratio of SiC to carbon
grains averaged at the outer boundary ranges from 0.098 to 0.23 for the
sticking probability $\alpha_{\rm s}$=0.1-1.0. The size distributions with the
peak at $\sim$ 0.2-0.3 $\rm{\mu}$m in radius cover the range of size derived
from the analysis of presolar SiC grains. Thus the difference between
temperatures of small cluster and gas plays a crucial role in the formation
process of SiC grains around C-rich AGB stars, and this aspect should be
explored for the formation process of dust grains in astrophysical
environments.

linear-iterative distributed algorithms for consensus and coordination problems
in multicomponent systems, in which unreliable communication links may drop
packets. We consider a setup where communication links between components can
be asymmetric (i.e., component j might be able to send information to component
i, but not necessarily vice-versa), so that the information exchange between
components in the system is in general described by a directed graph that is
assumed to be strongly connected. In the absence of communication link
failures, each component i maintains two auxiliary variables and updates each
of their values to be a linear combination of their corresponding previous
values and the corresponding previous values of neighboring components (i.e.,
components that send information to node i). By appropriately initializing
these two (decoupled) iterations, the system components can asymptotically
calculate variables of interest in a distributed fashion; in particular, the
average of the initial conditions can be calculated as a function that involves
the ratio of these two auxiliary variables. The focus of this paper to
robustify this double-iteration algorithm against communication link failures.
We achieve this by modifying the double-iteration algorithm (by introducing
some additional auxiliary variables) and prove that the modified
double-iteration converges almost surely to average consensus. In the first
part of the paper, we study the first and second moments of the two iterations,
and use them to establish convergence, and illustrate the performance of the
algorithm with several numerical examples. In the second part, in order to
establish the convergence of the algorithm, we use coefficients of ergodicity

component can iteratively exchange information with other components in its

components' initial values or some other quantity of interest (i.e., some
function of these initial values). In particular, we study an iterative
algorithm for computing the average of the initial values of the nodes. In this
algorithm, each component maintains two sets of variables that are updated via
two identical linear iterations. The average of the initial values of the nodes
can be asymptotically computed by each node as the ratio of two of the
variables it maintains. In the first part of this paper, we show how the update
rules for the two sets of variables can be enhanced so that the algorithm
becomes tolerant to communication links that may drop packets, independently
among them and independently between different transmission times. In this
second part, by rewriting the collective dynamics of both iterations, we show
that the resulting system is mathematically equivalent to a finite inhomogenous
Markov chain whose transition matrix takes one of finitely many values at each
step. Then, by using e a coefficients of ergodicity approach, a method commonly
used for convergence analysis of Markov chains, we prove convergence of the
robustified consensus scheme. The analysis suggests that similar convergence
should hold under more general conditions as well.

(WISE) project, we have carried out a highly uniform survey of the near-Earth
object (NEO) population at thermal infrared wavelengths ranging from 3 to 22
$\mu$m, allowing us to refine estimates of their numbers, sizes, and albedos.
The NEOWISE survey detected NEOs the same way whether they were previously
known or not, subject to the availability of ground-based follow-up
observations, resulting in the discovery of more than 130 new NEOs. The
survey's uniformity in sensitivity, observing cadence, and image quality have
permitted extrapolation of the 428 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) detected by
NEOWISE during the fully cryogenic portion of the WISE mission to the larger
population. We find that there are 981$\pm$19 NEAs larger than 1 km and
20,500$\pm$3000 NEAs larger than 100 m. We show that the Spaceguard goal of
detecting 90% of all 1 km NEAs has been met, and that the cumulative size
distribution is best represented by a broken power law with a slope of
1.32$\pm$0.14 below 1.5 km. This power law slope produces $\sim13,200\pm$1,900
NEAs with $D>$140 m. Although previous studies predict another break in the
cumulative size distribution below $D\sim$50-100 m, resulting in an increase in
the number of NEOs in this size range and smaller, we did not detect enough
objects to comment on this increase. The overall number for the NEA population
between 100-1000 m are lower than previous estimates. The numbers of near-Earth
comets will be the subject of future work.

  Multi-modal Logic",,,,,"cs.LO cs.AI math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While belief functions may be seen formally as a generalization of
probabilistic distributions, the question of the interactions between belief
functions and probability is still an issue in practice. This question is
difficult, since the contexts of use of these theory are notably different and
the semantics behind these theories are not exactly the same. A prominent issue
is increasingly regarded by the community, that is the management of the
conflicting information. Recent works have introduced new rules for handling
the conflict redistribution while combining belief functions. The notion of
conflict, or its cancellation by an hypothesis of open world, seems by itself
to prevent a direct interpretation of belief function in a probabilistic
framework. This paper addresses the question of a probabilistic interpretation
of belief functions. It first introduces and implements a theoretically
grounded rule, which is in essence an adaptive conjunctive rule. It is shown,
how this rule is derived from a logical interpretation of the belief functions
by means of a probabilistic multimodal logic; in addition, a concept of source
independence is introduced, based on a principle of entropy maximization.

that it is not possible to construct such conditional operator within the space

that any probability defined on a Boolean algebra may be extended to its
algebraic extension in compliance with the multiplicative definition of the

for asteroid classification schemes based on visible and near-infrared
observations for a large sample of minor planets. We have determined the
albedos for nearly 1900 asteroids classified by the Tholen, Bus and Bus-DeMeo
taxonomic classification schemes. We find that the S-complex spans a broad
range of bright albedos, partially overlapping the low albedo C-complex at
small sizes. As expected, the X-complex covers a wide range of albedos. The
multi-wavelength infrared coverage provided by NEOWISE allows determination of
the reflectivity at 3.4 and 4.6 $\mu$m relative to the visible albedo. The
direct computation of the reflectivity at 3.4 and 4.6 $\mu$m enables a new
means of comparing the various taxonomic classes. Although C, B, D and T
asteroids all have similarly low visible albedos, the D and T types can be
distinguished from the C and B types by examining their relative reflectance at
3.4 and 4.6 $\mu$m. All of the albedo distributions are strongly affected by
selection biases against small, low albedo objects, as all objects selected for
taxonomic classification were chosen according to their visible light
brightness. Due to these strong selection biases, we are unable to determine
whether or not there are correlations between size, albedo and space
weathering. We argue that the current set of classified asteroids makes any
such correlations difficult to verify. A sample of taxonomically classified
asteroids drawn without significant albedo bias is needed in order to perform
such an analysis.

described in detail in Paper I, the emission observed using the 4.5-micron
filter is enhanced in molecular shocks (T=1000-4000 K) at relatively high
temperature or densities compared with that observed with the 8.0-micron
filter. Using these data sets, we investigate different distributions of gas
between high and low temperatures/densities. Our analysis reveals the presence
of a number of warm/dense knots, most of which appear to be associated with
working surfaces such as the head of bow shocks and cometary features, and
reverse shocks in the ejecta. These are distributed not only along the jet
axis, as expected, but also across it. While some knotty or fragmenting
structures can be explained by instabilities in shocked flows, others can be
more simply explained by the scenario that the mass ejection source acts as a
""shot gun"", periodically ejecting bullets of material along similar but not
identical trajectories. Such an explanation challenges to some degree the
present paradigm for jet flows associated with low-mass protostars. It also
give clues to reconciling our understanding of the mass ejection mechanism in
high and low mass protostars and evolved stars.

by defocused imaging of single Au nanorods (AuNRs) through an ordinary

two-photon luminescence intensities for a large number of single AuNRs, we
correlate their defocused images with their three-dimensional spatial
orientations. As many AuNRs can be monitored in parallel, defocused imaging of
single AuNRs is a high throughput sensing technique that allows us to obtain
their spatial orientations within one frame in situ and real-time. The probe
size can be down to several nanometers, which is highly desirable in order to
minimize any potential interference from the probe itself. Furthermore, the
sensing property is insensitive to the excitation polarization and the
distribution of the probe aspect ratio, which allows AuNRs of any length in a
proper regime to be used as orientation sensors without changing the laser
frequency and polarization. These unique features make the orientation probes
proposed here outstanding candidates for optical imaging and sensing in
material science and biology.

among the entropies and extropies of course and fine partitions. We also
analyze the extropy function for densities, showing that relative extropy
constitutes a dual to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, widely recognized as the
continuous entropy measure. These results are unified within the general
structure of Bregman divergences. In this context they identify half the $L_2$
metric as the extropic dual to the entropic directed distance. We describe a
statistical application to the scoring of sequential forecast distributions
which provoked the discovery.

properties, we confirm these sources to be a mixture of supernovae (SNe) and
supernova remnants (SNRs). Of the 17 detected sources we resolve 7 at both
wavelengths. The SNe generally only have upper size limits. In contrast all the
SNRs are resolved with diameters {\geq} 0.27 pc. This size limit is consistent
with them having just entered their Sedov phase while embedded in an
interstellar medium (ISM) of density 10^4 cm^{-3} . These objects lie on the
diameter-luminosity correlation for SNRs (and so also on the diameter-surface
brightness relation) and extend these correlations to very small sources. The
data are consistent with the relation L {\propto} D^{-9/4}. Revised
equipartition arguments adjusted to a magnetic field to relativistic particle
energy density ratio of 1% combined with a reasonable synchrotron-emitting
volume filling factor of 10% give estimated magnetic field strengths in the SNR
shells of ~ 15-50 mG. The SNR shell magnetic fields are unlikely to come from
compression of ambient ISM fields and must instead be internally generated. We
set an upper limit of 7 mG for the ISM magnetic field. The estimated energy in
relativistic particles, 2%-20% of the explosion kinetic energy, is consistent
with estimates from models that fit the IR-radio correlation in compact
starburst galaxies.

spatial distribution, dynamics of A671 are investigated. The substructures of
A671 are well shown by the sample of bright members, but it appears less
significant based on the enlarged sample, which is mainly due to larger
uncertainties in the light-of-sight velocities of the newly-selected faint
members. The SDSS r-band luminosity function of A671 is flat at faint
magnitudes, with the faint end slope parameter alpha=-1.12. The SDSS spectra
allow us to investigate the star formation history of bright cluster galaxies,
and the galaxies in the core region are found to be older than those in the
outskirts. No environmental effect is found for metallicities of the early-type
galaxies (ETGs). The positive correlation between age and stellar mass supports
the downsizing scenario. By comparing ETG absorption-line indices with the
state-of-art stellar population models, we derive the relevant parameters of
simple stellar population (such as age, [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and
[Ca/Fe]). The ETGs at cluster center tend to have smaller hb indices,
indicating that central ETGs are likely to be older. The distribution of total
metallicity indicator, [MgFe]', does not show any environmental effects. The
relations between the simple stellar population parameters and velocity
dispersion in A671 are in good agreement with previous studies.

converging to its asymptotic value with $1/\ln N$ corrections. We then
elucidate the scaling laws ruling the behavior of this asymptotic value in the

${\cal O}(\ln N)$ exponents taking finite values. We finally investigate the
robustness of these results by studying a ""2D"" extension of the HMF model where
each particle is endowed with 4 degrees of freedom, thus allowing the emergence
of chaos at the level of single particle. Altogether, these results illustrate
the subtle effects of global (or long-range) coupling, and the importance of
the order in which the infinite-time and infinite-size limits are taken: for an

high-$T_c$ superconductivity, the fractional quantum-Hall effect, and quark
confinement are still awaiting a universally accepted explanation. The main
obstacle is the computational complexity of solving even the most simplified
theoretical models that are designed to capture the relevant quantum
correlations of the many-body system of interest. In his seminal 1982 paper
[Int. J. Theor. Phys. 21, 467], Richard Feynman suggested that such models
might be solved by ""simulation"" with a new type of computer whose constituent
parts are effectively governed by a desired quantum many-body dynamics.
Measurements on this engineered machine, now known as a ""quantum simulator,""
would reveal some unknown or difficult to compute properties of a model of
interest. We argue that a useful quantum simulator must satisfy four
conditions: relevance, controllability, reliability, and efficiency. We review
the current state of the art of digital and analog quantum simulators. Whereas
so far the majority of the focus, both theoretically and experimentally, has
been on controllability of relevant models, we emphasize here the need for a
careful analysis of reliability and efficiency in the presence of
imperfections. We discuss how disorder and noise can impact these conditions,
and illustrate our concerns with novel numerical simulations of a paradigmatic
example: a disordered quantum spin chain governed by the Ising model in a
transverse magnetic field. We find that disorder can decrease the reliability
of an analog quantum simulator of this model, although large errors in local
observables are introduced only for strong levels of disorder. We conclude that
the answer to the question ""Can we trust quantum simulators?"" is... to some
extent.

partons with given longitudinal momentum x and given polarization in a hadron
polarized longitudinally with respect to its motion. After the discovery, more
than 70 years ago, that the proton is not elementary, the observation of
Bjorken scaling in the late 1960s lead to the idea of hadrons containing almost
pointlike constituents, the partons. Since then, Deep Inelastic Scattering
(DIS) has played a crucial role in our understanding of hadron structure.
Through DIS experiments it has been possible to link the partons to the quarks,
and to unveil the presence of other pointlike constituents, the gluons, which
lead into a dynamical theory of quarks and gluons - quantum chromodynamics
(QCD). Polarized DIS, i.e. the collision of a longitudinally polarized lepton
beam on a polarized target (either longitudinally or transversely polarized),
provides a complementary information regarding the structure of the nucleon.
Whereas ordinary DIS probes simply the number density of partons with a
fraction x of the momentum of the parent hadron, polarized DIS can partly
answer the question as to the number density of partons with given x and given
spin polarization in a hadron of definite polarization, either parallel or
transverse with respect to the motion of the hadron. In here, the phenomenology
associated with DIS off longitudinally polarized targets, and the present
theoretical understanding of the dynamics involved, are described.

on the interpretation of their observations and for inferring key physical
parameters such as their true energy and event rate. Semi-analytic models
generally predict a fast lateral expansion, where the jet opening angle
asymptotically grows exponentially with its radius. Numerical simulations,
however, show a much more modest lateral expansion, where the jet retains
memory of its initial opening angle for a very long time, and the flow remains
non-spherical until it becomes sub-relativistic, and only then gradually
approaches spherical symmetry. Here we suggest a new analytic model based on a
new physically derived recipe for the lateral expansion. We also generalize the
model by relaxing the common approximations of ultra-relativistic motion and a
narrow jet opening angle. We find that the new analytic model fits much better
the results of numerical simulations, mainly because it remains valid also in
the mildly relativistic, quasi spherical regime. This model shows that for
modest initial jet half-opening angles, \theta_0, the outflow is not
sufficiently ultra-relativistic when its Lorentz factor reaches \Gamma =
1/\theta_0 and therefore the sideways expansion is rather slow, showing no
rapid, exponential phase. On the other hand, we find that jets with an
extremely narrow initial half-opening angle, of about \theta_0 << 10^{-1.5} or
so, which are still sufficiently ultra-relativistic at \Gamma = 1/\theta_0, do
show a phase of rapid, exponential lateral expansion. However, even such jets
that expand sideways exponentially are still not spherical when they become
sub-relativistic.

subject of a radical revision. We find that $k$ strongly depends on the
thermodynamics of background matter. The time scale, at which negative
curvature might take place, depends on the relation between the matter content

is likely to generate stronger slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves as compared
to swirly motions. Correspondingly, the energy flux transported differs as a
result of the driving motions. We also demonstrate that the waves generated by
granular buffeting are likely to manifest in stronger emission in the
chromospheric network. We argue that different mechanisms of wave generation
are active during the evolution of a magnetic element in the intergranular

application of the formalism in solving the evolution problem for many-body
systems in terms of semiclassical expansion. In any fixed order of expansion
over the Planck's constant, the evolution problem can be reduced to a
statistical-mechanics problem of calculating an ensemble of quantum
characteristics in the phase space and their Jacobi fields. In comparison with
the corresponding rules of classical statistical mechanics, the rules for
computing the probabilities and time-dependent averages of observables are
modified. The evolution equations represent a finite system of first-order
ordinary differential equations for quantum trajectories in the phase space and
the associated Jacobi fields. Quantum characteristics allow for the consistent
inclusion of specific quantum effects, such as non-localities and coherence, in
the description of the propagation of particles in the transport models. Since
the late 1980s - early 1990s, when the first transport models were created for
modeling heavy-ion collisions, computing power has increased by about five
orders of magnitude. This dramatic rise in computing power makes it possible to
include Jacobi fields in the collision dynamics, to extend beyond the classical
treatment of phase-space trajectories, currently adopted in all of the

together. The crosslinks are reversible: they can dynamically bind and unbind
adjacent filament pairs as controlled by a binding enthalpy. The bundle is
subjected to a bending deformation and the corresponding distribution of
crosslinks is measured. For a bundle consisting of two filaments, upon
increasing the bending amplitude, a first-order transition is observed. The
transition is from a state where the filaments are tightly coupled by many
bound crosslinks, to a state of nearly independent filaments with only a few
bound crosslinks. For a bundle consisting of more than two filaments, a series
of first-order transitions is observed. The transitions are connected with the
formation of an interface between regions of low and high crosslink densities.
Combining umbrella sampling Monte Carlo simulations with analytical
calculations, we present a detailed picture of how the competition between
crosslink shearing and filament stretching drives the transitions. We also find
that, when the crosslinks become soft, collective behavior is not observed: the
crosslinks then unbind one after the other leading to a smooth decrease of the
average crosslink density.

are essential for using large cluster samples for cosmology. Cluster relations
such as the Lx-T, M-T, Lx-M relations, have been investigated extensively,
however the question remains whether these relations hold true also for groups.
Some evidence supports a break at low masses, possibly caused by the influence
of non-gravitational physics on low-mass systems. The main goal of this work is
to test scaling relations for the low-mass range to check whether there is a
systematic difference between clusters and groups, and to extend this method of
reliable cluster mass determination for future samples down to the group
regime. We compiled a statistically complete sample of 112 X-ray galaxy groups,
26 with Chandra data. Temperature, metallicity, and surface brightness profiles
were created, and used to determine the main physical quantities and scaling
relations. We then compared the group properties to the HIFLUGCS clusters and
other samples. We present profiles and scaling relations of the whole sample. T
and Z profiles behave universally, except for the cores. The Lx-T, M-T, Lx-M,
Mg-M, M-Yx, and Lx-Yx relations are in good agreement with clusters. The Lx-T
relation steepens for T<3keV, which could point to a larger impact of heating
mechanisms on cooler systems. We found a strong drop in the gas mass fraction
below 1keV, which indicates the ICM is less dominant in groups and the galaxies
have a stronger influence on the system. In all relations the intrinsic scatter
for groups is larger, which appears not correlated with merger activity but
could be due to scatter caused by baryonic physics in the group cores. We also
demonstrate the importance of selection effects. We have found evidence for a
similarity break between groups and clusters. However this does not have a
strong effect on scaling relations.

vastly disagree with the predictions from smooth mass models. With our adaptive
optics observations we find a luminous object, Object L, located ~0.3"" to the
North of the lens galaxy, but we show that it can not be responsible for the
anomalous flux ratios. Object L as well as a luminous extension of the lens
galaxy to the South are seen in the archival HST/ACS image in the F814W filter.
This suggests that Object L is part of a bar in the lens galaxy, as also
supported by the presence of a significant disk component in the light profile
of the lens galaxy. Finally, we do not find evidence for any other luminous
substructure that may explain the quasar images flux ratios. However, owe to
the persistence of the flux ratio anomaly over time (~ 7 years) a combination

intense hydrogen emission lines has been explained by a radiative shock wave,
periodically propagating throughout the atmosphere. Previous observation of the
Mira star omicron Ceti around a bright maximum of light led to the detection of
a strong linear polarization associated to Balmer emissions, although the
origin of this phenomenon is not fully explained yet. With the help of
spectropolarimetry, we propose to investigate the nature of shock waves
propagating throughout the stellar atmosphere and present, for omicron Ceti
(the prototype of Mira stars), a full observational study of hydrogen emission
lines formed in the radiative region of such a shock. Using the instrument
NARVAL, we performed a spectropolarimetric monitoring of omicron Ceti during
three consecutive pulsation cycles. All Stokes parameters were systematically
collected, with a particular emphasis on the maxima of luminosity, i.e. when a
radiative shock wave is supposed to emerge from the photosphere and propagate
outward. On Balmer lines, over a large part of the luminosity cycle, we report
detections in Stokes spectra which are evolving with time. These signatures
appear to be strongly correlated to the presence of an intense shock wave
responsible for the hydrogen emission lines. We establish that those lines are
polarized by a process inherent to the mechanism responsible for the emission
line formation: the shock wave itself. Two mechanisms are considered: a global
one that implies a polarization induced by convective cells located around the
photosphere and a local one that implies a charge separation due to the passage
of the shock wave, inducing an electrical current. Combined with the existing
turbulence, this may generate a magnetic field, hence polarization.

with uncertain supply and demand, and supply friction. The storage is
frictionless as a supply source, but once used, it cannot be filled up
instantaneously. The focus application is a power supply network in which the
base supply and demand are assumed to match perfectly, while deviations from
the base are modeled as random shocks with stochastic arrivals. Due to
friction, the random surge shocks cannot be tracked by the main supply sources.
Storage, when available, can be used to compensate, fully or partially, for the
surge in demand or loss of supply. The problem of optimal utilization of
storage with the objective of maximizing system reliability is formulated as
minimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite
horizon. It is shown that when the stage cost is linear in the size of the
blackout, the optimal policy is myopic in the sense that all shocks are
compensated by storage up to the available level of storage. However, when the
stage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to curtail some of the demand
and allow a small current blackout in the interest of maintaining a higher
level of reserve to avoid a large blackout in the future. The value of storage
capacity in improving system's reliability, as well as the effects of the
associated optimal policies under different stage costs on the probability
distribution of blackouts are examined.

GHz or above) radio frequencies as a promising transmission technique improving
the quality of service, providing high data rate, and extending the coverage
area without additional transmit power in deeply shadowed fading environments.
The performance of relay-based systems considerably depends on which relay
selection protocols (RSPs) are used. These RSPs are typically using the channel
side information (CSI). Specifically, the relay terminal (RT) is chosen among
all available RTs by a central entity (CE) which receives all RTs' CSI via
feedback channels. However, in the millimeter wave radio frequencies, the rate
of the CSI variation is much higher than that of the CSI variation in 6 GHz
frequencies under the same mobility conditions, which evidently results in a
serious problem causing that the CSI at the CE is inaccurate for the RSP since
the feedback channels have a backhaul / transmission delay. However and
fortunately, the shadowing side information (SSI) varies very slowly in
comparison to the rate of the CSI variation. In this context, we propose in
this paper a partial-RSP in dual-hop amplify-and-forward relaying system, which
utilize only the SSI of the RTs instead of their CSI. Then for the performance
analysis, we obtain an exact average unified performance (AUP) of the proposed
SSI-based partial-RSP for a variety shadowed fading environments. In
particular, we offer a generic AUP expression whose special cases include the
average bit error probability (ABEP) analysis for binary modulation schemes,
the ergodic capacity analysis and the moments-generating function (MGF)-based
characterization. The correctness of our newly theoretical results is validated
with some selected numerical examples in an extended generalized-K fading
environment.

on LANL geosynchronous satellites is used for selection of 169 case events
containing 638 geosynchronous magnetopause crossings (GMCs) in 1995 to 2001. We
study the necessary conditions for the geosynchronous magnetopause crossings
using scatter plot of the GMCs in the coordinate space of Psw versus Bz. In
such representation the upstream solar wind conditions demonstrate sharp
envelope boundary under which no GMCs are occurred. The boundary has two strait
horizontal branches where Bz does not influence on the magnetopause location.
The first branch is located in the range of Psw=21 nPa for large positive Bz
and is associated with an asymptotic regime of the pressure balance. The second
branch asymptotically approaches to the range of Psw=4.8 nPa under very strong
negative Bz and it is associated with a regime of the Bz influence saturation.
We suggest that the saturation is caused by relatively high contribution of the
magnetosphere thermal pressure into the pressure balance on the magnetopause.
The intermediate region of the boundary for the moderate negative and small
positive IMF Bz can be well approximated by a hyperbolic tangent function. We
interpret the envelope boundary as a range of necessary upstream solar wind
conditions required for GMC in the point on the magnetopause located mostly
close to the Earth (""perigee"" point). We obtain that the dipole tilt angle and
dawn-dusk asymmetry influence on the ""perigee"" point location. We find that the
aGSM latitude of this point depends linearly on the dipole tilt angle with the
slope about -0.5. The aGSM longitude of the ""perigee"" point decreases with IMF
Bz with a rate of about 2 angular minutes per 1 nT. An empirical model
predicting the magnetopause crossing of the geosynchronous orbit in the

new information on \theta_{13}, hinting that 0.01\lesssim sin^2 2\theta_{13}

will have a crucial impact on the optimization of the future long-baseline
oscillation experiments designed to probe the neutrino mass ordering and
leptonic CP violation. In this context, we expound in detail the physics reach
of an experimental setup where neutrinos produced in a conventional wide-band
beam facility at CERN are observed in a proposed Giant Liquid Argon detector at
the Pyh\""asalmi mine, at a distance of 2290 km. This particular setup would
have unprecedented sensitivity to the mass ordering and CP violation in the
light of large \theta_{13}. With a 10 to 20 kt `pilot' detector and just a few
years of neutrino beam running, the mass hierarchy could be determined,
irrespective of the true values of \delta_{CP} and the mass hierarchy, at 3
sigma (5 sigma) C.L. if sin^2 2\theta_{13}(true) = 0.05 (0.1). With the same
exposure, we start to have 3 sigma sensitivity to CP violation if sin^2
2\theta_{13}(true) > 0.05, in particular testing maximally CP-violating
scenarios at a high C.L. After optimizing the neutrino and anti-neutrino
running fractions, we study the performance of the setup as a function of the
exposure, identifying three milestones to have roughly 30%, 50% and 70%
coverage in \delta_{CP}(true) for 3 sigma CP violation discovery. For
comparison, we also study the CERN to Slanic baseline of 1540 km. This work
demonstrates that an incremental program, staged in terms of the exposure, can
achieve the desired physics goals within a realistically feasible timescale,
and produce significant new results at each stage.

a semiconductor quantum dot interacting with an acoustic phonon bath and a high
$Q$ microcavity. Power broadening is investigated using a time-convolutionless
master equation in the polaron frame which allows for a nonperturbative
treatment of the interaction of the quantum dot with the phonon reservoir. We
calculate the full non-Lorentzian photoluminescence (PL) lineshapes and
numerically extract the intensity linewidths of the quantum dot exciton and the
cavity mode as a function of pump rate and temperature. For increasing field
strengths, multiphonon and multiphoton effects are found to be important, even
for phonon bath temperatures as low as 4 K. We show that the interaction of the
quantum dot with the phonon reservoir introduces pronounced features in the
power broadened PL lineshape, enabling one to observe clear signatures of
electron-phonon scattering. The PL lineshapes from cavity pumping and exciton
pumping are found to be distinctly different, primarily since the latter is
excited through the exciton-phonon reservoir. To help explain the underlying
physics of phonon scattering on the power broadened lineshape, an effective
phonon Lindblad master equation derived from the full time-convolutionless
master equation is introduced; we identify and calculate distinct Lindblad
scattering contributions from electron-phonon interactions, including effects
such as excitation-induced dephasing, incoherent exciton excitation and
exciton-cavity feeding. Our effective phonon master equation is shown to
reproduce the full intensity PL and the phonon-coupling effects very well,
suggesting that its general Lindblad form may find widespread use in
semiconductor cavity-QED.

fields of the significant wave height <Hs(x,y,T,R)> and the wave energy
<Ea(x,y,T,R>, calculated with different scales of averaging in time T and space
R; b) estimating the fields of seasonal, annual and long-term variability; and
c) determining the 12-year trend of the annually averaged fields. The analysis
was carried out taking into account the previously introduced zoning the ocean
area, provided by the spatial inhomogeneity of the wind field [3]. Further
analysis includes a) creation of time series for the averaged (over zones and
across the ocean) wave height, <Hs(x,y,T,R)>, and wave energy, <Ea(x,y,T,R>; b)
construction of the frequency spectra of these series; c) finding the extrema
of wave field; d) making histograms of wave heights (in the zones and the whole
ocean); and e) calculating the first four statistical moments for the
waveheight field (in the zones and whole IO). The results obtained allow us to
estimate the stored energy of the wave field in the Indian Ocean and the scales
of its variability; to establish a positive 12-year trend of the averaged wave
height (about 1% per year) and wave energy (2% per year); to determine features
of the probability distribution; and to describe the statistical properties of
the wave field in the zones of the Indian ocean.

explain the top quark forward-backward asymmetry A^t_FB measured at the

W'-model and the color triplet diquark (\phi) model. Requiring these models to
explain A^t_FB and also satisfy the top pair production rate measured at the
Tevatron, we examine their contributions to the LHC observables such as the
polarization and charge asymmetry in top quark and W' (or \phi) productions. We
find that these observables can be enhanced to the observable level and the
current LHC measurement on the top charge asymmetry can already tightly
constrain the W'-model. We also find that each observable shows different

above 10^19 eV for observing airshowers via air fluorescence, the potential for
observing the cosmogenic neutrino flux associated with the GZK effect is
limited. However, the forward Cherenkov signal associated with the airshower
can be observed at much lower energies. A simulation was developed to determine
the Cherenkov signal strength and spatial extent at low-Earth orbit for
upward-moving airshowers. A model of tau neutrino interactions in the Earth was
employed to determine the event rate of interactions that yielded a tau lepton
which would induce an upward-moving airshower observable by a space-based
instrument. The effect of neutrino attenuation by the Earth forces the viewing
of the Earth's limb to observe the nu_tau-induced Cherenkov airshower signal at
above the OWL Cherenkov energy threshold of ~10^16.5 eV for limb-viewed events.
Furthermore, the neutrino attenuation limits the effective terrestrial neutrino
target area to ~3x10^5 km^2 at 10^17 eV, for an orbit of 1000 km and an
instrumental full Field-of-View of 45 degrees. This translates into an
observable cosmogenic neutrino event rate of ~1/year based upon two different

10% duty cycle for observation.

have been developed for medical applications. The feasibility of dosimeters
using optical fibers that are almost Cherenkov light free has been demonstrated
in some prototypes, particularly suitable for photon high-energy beams. In the
energy range up to a few hundred keV, where the production of Cherenkov light
by secondary electrons is negligible or small, the largest source of background
are the fluorescence mechanisms. Methods: In recent years our group has
developed an optical fiber dosimeter with photodiode readout named DosFib,
which has small energy dependence in the range below 100 keV relevant for
radiology. Photodiodes are robust photodetectors, presenting good stability
over time and enough sensitivity to allow the use of an electrometer as a
measuring device without extra electronics. Results: In-vitro tests using a
High Dose Rate 192Ir source have demonstrated its suitability for brachytherapy
applications using this important radioactive source. Attenuation curves have
been obtained in water with the DosFib dosimeter and an ionization chamber and
the depth dose profiles shown to be identical. Conclusions: This new dosimeter
can thus be calibrated and used in clinical measurements with good competitive
advantages over other dosimeters.

constraining episodes of energy release in the early Universe. In this paper we
revisit and refine the computations of the cosmological thermalization problem.
For this purpose a new code, called CosmoTherm, was developed that allows
solving the coupled photon-electron Boltzmann equation in the expanding,
isotropic Universe for small spectral distortion in the CMB. We explicitly
compute the shape of the spectral distortions caused by energy release due to
(i) annihilating dark matter; (ii) decaying relict particles; (iii) dissipation
of acoustic waves; and (iv) quasi-instantaneous heating. We also demonstrate
that (v) the continuous interaction of CMB photons with adiabatically cooling
non-relativistic electrons and baryons causes a negative mu-type CMB spectral
distortion of DI_nu/I_nu ~ 10^{-8} in the GHz spectral band. We solve the
thermalization problem including improved approximations for the double Compton
and Bremsstrahlung emissivities, as well as the latest treatment of the
cosmological recombination process. At redshifts z <~ 10^3 the matter starts to
cool significantly below the temperature of the CMB so that at very low
frequencies free-free absorption alters the shape of primordial distortions
significantly. In addition, the cooling electrons down-scatter CMB photons
introducing a small late negative y-type distortion at high frequencies. We
also discuss our results in the light of the recently proposed CMB experiment
Pixie, for which CosmoTherm should allow detailed forecasting. Our current
computations show that for energy injection because of (ii) and (iv) Pixie
should allow to improve existing limits, while the CMB distortions caused by
the other processes seem to remain unobservable with the currently proposed
sensitivities and spectral bands of Pixie.

mathematical model is based on five basic processes: (1) The formation of

(3) A kinetic orienting effect which inhibits crystal growth, (4) The

detailed comparisons of both orienting effects which actually act in unison in
the experiment. Numerical results indicate that the model can yield a high
percentage orientation of the mixed crystals at the interface and the
consequent resolution of the initially racemic mixture of amino acids in

average occupation probability and $p_d$ controlling the anisotropy. The
Leath-Alexandrowicz method is used to grow a cluster from an active seed site.
We call this model with two main growth directions {\em biased directed
percolation} (BDP). Standard isotropic percolation (IP) and DP are the two
limiting cases of the BDP model, corresponding to $p_d=1/2$ and $p_d=0,1$
respectively. In this work, besides IP and DP, we also consider the $1/2<p_d<1$

simple-cubic lattices, and the numerical data are analyzed by finite-size
scaling. We locate the percolation thresholds of the BDP model for $p_d=0.6$

be consistent with those for standard DP. We also determine the renormalization
exponent associated with the asymmetric perturbation due to $p_d -1/2 \neq 0$

feature that the scaling property of the electric transport to time is
insensitive to other elements, such as the distance of the sites or the spatial

were considered. Crystalline approximation to the amorphous quartz allows to
study the effect of oxygen coverage or environmental effects on the surface
states degradation which has gained attention recently in the experimental
community. We considered both symmetric and asymmetric dielectric cappings to
the sufaces of TI thin films. Our studies suggest that BN and quartz cappings
have negligible effects on the Dirac cone surface states of both binary and
ternary TIs, except in the case of an oxygen-terminated quartz surface.
Dangling bond states of oxygens in oxygen-terminated quartz dominate the region
close to Fermi level, thereby distorting the TI Dirac cone feature and burying
the Dirac point in the quartz valence band region. Passivating the
oxygen-terminated surface with atomic hydrogen removes these dangling bond
states from the Fermi surface region, and consequently the clear Dirac cone is
recovered. Our results are consistent with recent experimental studies of TI
surface degradation in the presence of oxygen coverage.
