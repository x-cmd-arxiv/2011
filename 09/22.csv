converted into magnetic energy, and thus is expected to depend crucially on the
nature of turbulence. In this work, we present a model for the small-scale
dynamo that takes into account the slope of the turbulent velocity spectrum
v(l) ~ l^theta, where l and v(l) are the size of a turbulent fluctuation and
the typical velocity on that scale. The time evolution of the fluctuation
component of the magnetic field, i.e., the small-scale field, is described by
the Kazantsev equation. We solve this linear differential equation for its
eigenvalues with the quantum-mechanical WKB-approximation. The validity of this
method is estimated as a function of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. We
calculate the minimal magnetic Reynolds number for dynamo action, Rm_crit,
using our model of the turbulent velocity correlation function. For Kolmogorov
turbulence (theta=1/3), we find that the critical magnetic Reynolds number is
approximately 110 and for Burgers turbulence (theta=1/2) approximately 2700.
Furthermore, we derive that the growth rate of the small-scale magnetic field
for a general type of turbulence is Gamma ~ Re^((1-theta)/(1+theta)) in the
limit of infinite magnetic Prandtl numbers. For decreasing magnetic Prandtl
number (down to Pm approximately larger than 10), the growth rate of the
small-scale dynamo decreases. The details of this drop depend on the
WKB-approximation, which becomes invalid for a magnetic Prandtl number of about
unity.

transitional disks, and disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars, than for those around

emission of gamma-ray bursts (hereafter GRBs) to the absolute luminosity are of
great importance as they both constrain the radiation mechanisms and represent
potential distance indicators. Here we discuss two such relations: the
lag-luminosity relation and the newly discovered duration-luminosity relation
of GRB pulses. We aim to extend our previous work on the origin of spectral
lags, using the duration-luminosity relation recently discovered by Hakkila et
al. to connect lags and luminosity. We also present a way to test this relation
which has originally been established with a limited sample of only 12 pulses.
We relate lags to the spectral evolution and shape of the pulses with a linear
expansion of the pulse properties around maximum. We then couple this first
result to the duration-luminosity relation to obtain the lag-luminosity and
lag-duration relations. We finally use a Monte-Carlo method to generate a
population of synthetic GRB pulses which is then used to check the validity of
the duration-luminosity relation. Our theoretical results for the lag and
duration-luminosity relations are in good agreement with the data. They are
rather insensitive to the assumptions regarding the burst spectral parameters.
Our Monte Carlo analysis of a population of synthetic pulses confirms that the
duration-luminosity relation must be satisfied to reproduce the observational
duration-peak flux diagram of BATSE GRB pulses. The newly discovered
duration-luminosity relation offers the possibility to link all three
quantities: lag, duration and luminosity of GRB pulses in a consistent way.
Some evidence for its validity have been presented but its origin is not easy
to explain in the context of the internal shock model.

parametrized modified growth equations and their evolution. We implement known

modified gravity parameters in redshift (time) and scale. The hybrid
parametrization combines a binned redshift dependence and a smooth evolution in
scale avoiding a jump in the matter power spectrum. The formalism developed to
test the consistency of current and future data with general relativity is
implemented in a package that we make publicly available and call ISiTGR

parameters are significantly correlated with \sigma_8 and mildly correlated
with \Omega_m, for all evolution methods. The degeneracies between \sigma_8 and

require bandwidth twice the required bandwidth over the conventional coherent
channel. We propose a method to transmit without intersymbol interference in a
bandwidth no larger than the bit rate. This is done by combining Nyquist or
root-Nyquist pulses with a constant bias and using higher-order modulation
formats. In fact, we can transmit with a bandwidth equal to that of coherent
transmission. A trade-off between the required average optical power and the
bandwidth is investigated. Depending on the bandwidth required, the most
power-efficient transmission is obtained by the parametric linear pulse, the
so-called ""better than Nyquist"" pulse, or the root-raised cosine pulse.

typically begin with a population of embryos and planetesimals that grow into
planets by merging. We analyzed the impact parameters of collisions leading to
the growth of terrestrial planets from recent $N$-body simulations that assumed
perfect merging and calculated more realistic outcomes using a new analytic
collision physics model. We find that collision outcomes are diverse and span
all possible regimes: hit-and-run, merging, partial accretion, partial erosion,
and catastrophic disruption. The primary outcomes of giant impacts between
planetary embryos are approximately evenly split between partial accretion,
graze-and-merge, and hit-and-run events. To explore the cumulative effects of
more realistic collision outcomes, we modeled the growth of individual planets
with a Monte Carlo technique using the distribution of impact parameters from
$N$-body simulations. We find that fewer planets reached masses $>0.7 M_{\rm
Earth}$ using the collision physics model compared to simulations that assumed
every collision results in perfect merging. For final planets with masses $>0.7
M_{\rm Earth}$, 60% are enriched in their core-to-mantle mass fraction by >10%
compared to the initial embryo composition. Fragmentation during planet
formation produces significant debris ($\sim15$% of the final mass) and occurs
primarily by erosion of the smaller body in partial accretion and hit-and-run
events. In partial accretion events, the target body grows by preferentially
accreting the iron core of the projectile and the escaping fragments are
derived primarily from the silicate mantles of both bodies. Thus, the bulk
composition of a planet can evolve via stochastic giant impacts.

investigated, as an alternative route, the use of Li abundances in Population

and observations suggest that the surface A(Li) in red giants after the
completion of the first dredge-up and before the RGB bump, are significantly
less sensitive to the efficiency of atomic diffusion, compared with dwarf
stars. Standard stellar models computed under different physical assumptions
show that the inclusion of the atomic diffusion has an impact of 0.07dex in the
determination of A(Li)0 (much smaller than the case of MS stars) and it is
basically unaffected by reasonable variations of other parameters
(overshooting, age,initial Y, mixing length). We have determined the surface Li
content of 17 Halo lower RGB stars,in the metallicity range [Fe/H]=-3.4 /-1.4
dex. The initial Li has then been inferred by accounting for the difference
between initial and post-dredge up A(Li) in the appropriate stellar models. It
depends mainly on the used T(eff) scale and is only weakly sensitive to the
efficiency of atomic diffusion,so long as one neglects Li destruction caused by
the process competing with atomic diffusion. Final A(Li)0 span a relatively
narrow range (2.28 /2.46 dex), and is 0.3-0.4 dex lower the WMAP/BBNS
predictions. These values of A(Li)0 are corroborated by the analysis of the GCs
NGC6397, NGC6752 and M4. Our result provides an independent quantitative
estimate of the difference with the Big Bang value and sets a very robust
constraint for the physical processes invoked to resolve this discrepancy.

number of simple labeled graphs with a given degree sequence is typically very
large even for short sequences, sampling methods are needed for statistical
studies. Currently, there are two main classes of methods that generate
samples. One of the existing methods first generates a restricted class of
graphs, then uses a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm based on edge swaps to
generate other realizations. As the mixing time of this process is still
unknown, the independence of the samples is not well controlled. The other
class of methods is based on the Configuration Model that may lead to
unacceptably many sample rejections due to self-loops and multiple edges. Here
we present an algorithm that can directly construct all possible realizations
of a given bi-degree sequence by simple digraphs. Our method is rejection free,
guarantees the independence of the constructed samples, and provides their
weight. The weights can then be used to compute statistical averages of network
observables as if they were obtained from uniformly distributed sampling, or

encompasses: i) a demodulate-and-forward protocol at the relays, where the
received packets are forwarded regardless of their reliability; and ii) a
maximum-likelihood optimum demodulator at the destination, which accounts for
possible demodulations errors at the relays. An asymptotically-tight and
closed-form expression of the end-to-end error probability is derived, which
clearly showcases diversity order and coding gain of each source. Unlike other
papers available in the literature, the proposed framework has three main
distinguishable features: i) it is useful for general network topologies and
arbitrary binary encoding vectors; ii) it shows how network code and two-hop
forwarding protocol affect diversity order and coding gain; and ii) it accounts
for realistic fading channels and demodulation errors at the relays. The
framework provides three main conclusions: i) each source achieves a diversity
order equal to the separation vector of the network code; ii) the coding gain
of each source decreases with the number of mixed packets at the relays; and
iii) if the destination cannot take into account demodulation errors at the
relays, it loses approximately half of the diversity order.

feedback prescriptions on the orbits of dark matter particles, stellar
particles and subhaloes, analysing runs with no feedback, with stellar feedback
and with feedback from supermassive black holes. We focus on the central
regions (0.25 r_{200}) of haloes with virial masses ~ 6 x 10^{13} (~ 7 x
10^{11}) Msun/h at z = 0(2). We also investigate how the orbital content
(relative fractions of the different orbital types) of these haloes depends on
several key parameters such as their mass, redshift and dynamical state. The
results of spectral analyses of the orbital content of these simulations are
compared, and the change in fraction of box, tube and irregular orbits is
quantified. Box orbits are found to dominate the orbital structure of dark
matter haloes in cosmological simulations. There is a strong anticorrelation
between the fraction of box orbits and the central baryon fraction. While
radiative cooling acts to reduce the fraction of box orbits, strong feedback
implementations result in a similar orbital distribution to that of the dark
matter only case. The orbital content described by the stellar particles is
found to be remarkably similar to that drawn from the orbits of dark matter
particles, suggesting that either they have forgotten their dynamical history,
or that subhaloes bringing in stars are not biased significantly with respect
to the main distribution. The orbital content of the subhaloes is in broad
agreement with that seen in the outer regions of the particle distributions.

system-environment coupling, obtained for a two-level system in contact with a
measurer (Markovian interaction) and a thermal bath (non-Markovian
interaction), where the measured observable may or may not commute with the
system-environment interaction. Analysing the behavior of the coherence, which
tends to a value asymptotically close to zero, we obtain an expression for the
time of measurement which depends only on the system-measurer coupling, and
which does not depend on whether the observable commutes with the system-bath
interaction. The behavior of the coherences in the case of strong
system-environment coupling, found numerically, indicates that an increase in
this coupling decreases the measurement time, thus allowing our expression to
be considered the upper limit for the duration of the process.

Following those results, we study here the tractability frontier in outlier
detection problems, by analyzing it with respect to (i) the considered outlier
detection problem, (ii) the reference default logic fragment, and (iii) the
adopted notion of outlier. As for point (i), we shall consider three problems
of increasing complexity, called Outlier-Witness Recognition, Outlier
Recognition and Outlier Existence, respectively. As for point (ii), as we look
for conditions under which outlier detection can be done efficiently, attention
will be limited to subsets of Disjunction-free propositional default theories.
As for point (iii), we shall refer to both the notion of outlier of [ABP08] and
a new and more restrictive one, called strong outlier. After complexity
results, we present a polynomial time algorithm for enumerating all strong
outliers of bounded size in an quasi-acyclic normal unary default theory. Some
of our tractability results rely on the Incremental Lemma that provides
conditions for a deafult logic fragment to have a monotonic behavior. Finally,
in order to show that the simple fragments of DL we deal with are still rich
enough to solve interesting problems and, therefore, the tractability results
that we prove are interesting not only on the mere theoretical side, insights
into the expressive capabilities of these fragments are provided, by showing
that normal unary theories express all NL queries, hereby indirectly answering

renormalization(RSR) of several network models including Erd""os R'enyi (ER)
graphs, scale-free networks and an annealed model (AM) related to ER graphs. In
RSR the network is locally coarse grained by choosing at each renormalization
step a node at random and joining it to all its neighbors. Compared to previous
(quasi-)parallel renormalization methods [C.Song et.al], RSR allows a more
fine-grained analysis of the renormalization group (RG) flow, and unravels new
features, that were not discussed in the previous analyses. In particular we
find that all networks exhibit a second order transition in their RG flow. This
phase transition is associated with the emergence of a giant hub and can be
viewed as a new variant of percolation, called agglomerative percolation. We
claim that this transition exists also in previous graph renormalization
schemes and explains some of the scaling laws seen there. For critical trees it
happens as N/N0 -> 0 in the limit of large systems (where N0 is the initial
size of the graph and N its size at a given RSR step). In contrast, it happens
at finite N/N0 in sparse ER graphs and in the annealed model, while it happens
for N/N0 -> 1 on scale-free networks. Critical exponents seem to depend on the
type of the graph but not on the average degree and obey usual scaling
relations for percolation phenomena. For the annealed model they agree with the
exponents obtained from a mean-field theory. At late times, the networks
exhibit a star-like structure in agreement with the results of Radicchi et. al.
While degree distributions are of main interest when regarding the scheme as
network renormalization, mass distributions (which are more relevant when
considering 'supernodes' as clusters) are much easier to study using the fast

AGN and the radius of its broad line region established via reverberation
mapping to determine the luminosity distances to a sample of 38 AGN. All
reliable distance measures up to now have been limited to moderate redshift --
AGN will, for the first time, allow distances to be estimated to z~4, where
variations of dark energy and alternate gravity theories can be probed.

nuclei (AGNs) from the XMM-COSMOS survey covering the range
M_BH/M_sun~10^(7.2--8.7). Virial M_BH estimates based on H_beta are available
from the COSMOS Magellan/IMACS survey. We use high-resolution Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) imaging to decompose the light of each type-1 AGN and host
galaxy, and employ a specially-built mass-to-light ratio to estimate the
stellar masses (M_*). The M_BH-M_* ratio shows a zero offset with respect to
the local relation for galactic bulge masses, and we also find no evolution in
the mass ratio M_BH/M_*=(1+z)^{0.02+-0.34} up to z~0.9. Interestingly, at the
high-M_BH end there is a positive offset from the z=0 relation, which can be
fully explained by a mass function bias with a cosmic scatter of 0.3,
reaffirming that the intrinsic distribution is consistent with zero evolution.
From our results we conclude that since z~0.9 no substantial addition of
stellar mass is required: the decline in star formation rates and merger
activity at z<1 support this scenario. Nevertheless, given that a significant
fraction of these galaxies show a disk component, their bulges are indeed
undermassive. This is a direct indication that for the last 7 Gyr the only
essential mechanism required in order that these galaxies obey the z=0 relation
is a redistribution of stellar mass to the bulge, likely driven by secular
processes, i.e., internal instabilities and minor merging.

and rotation periods. This is used to study the relationship between rotation
and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time.
From an unbiased subset of this sample the power law slope of the unsaturated
regime, L_X / L_bol = Ro^\beta, is fit as \beta = -2.70 +/- 0.13. This is
inconsistent with the canonical \beta=-2 slope to a confidence of 5 sigma, and
argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple
scaling analysis this implies \Delta\Omega / \Omega = \Omega^0.7, i.e. the
differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down.
Super-saturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its
parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with
both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory
providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We
estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and
super-saturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type
stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight
from super-saturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold
for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical
saturation threshold (Ro < 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we
suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with
saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the
empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between
convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.

hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxy formation (HYD) into a simple
semi-analytic model (SAM). This is achieved by summarizing the efficiencies of
accretion, cooling, star formation, and feedback given by the HYD, as functions
of the halo mass and redshift. Surprisingly, by turning the HYD into a SAM, we
conserve the mass of individual galaxies, with deviations at the level of 0.1
dex, on an object-by-object basis. This is true for all redshifts, and for the
mass of stars and gas components, although the agreement reaches 0.2 dex for
satellite galaxies at low redshift. We show that the same level of accuracy is
obtained even in case the SAM uses only one phase of gas within each galaxy.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the formation history of one massive galaxy
provides sufficient information for the SAM to reproduce the population of
galaxies within the entire cosmological box. The reasons for the small scatter
between the HYD and SAM galaxies are: a) The efficiencies are matched as
functions of the halo mass and redshift, meaning that the evolution within
merger-trees agrees on average. b) For a given galaxy, efficiencies fluctuate
around the mean value on time scales of 0.2-2 Gyr. c) The various mass
components of galaxies are obtained by integrating the efficiencies over time,
averaging out these fluctuations. We compare the efficiencies found here to
standard SAM recipes and find that they often deviate significantly. For
example, here the HYD shows smooth accretion that is less effective for low
mass haloes, and is always composed of hot or dilute gas; cooling is less
effective at high redshift; and star formation changes only mildly with cosmic
time. The method developed here can be applied in general to any HYD, and can
thus serve as a common language for both HYDs and SAM (Abridged).

produced by Drell-Yan processes and lead to displaced vertices when they decay.

this problem. We use an identical set of physics in corresponding simulations
carried out with the well-tested SPH code GADGET, adopting also the same
high-resolution gravity solver. We are thus able to compare both simulation
sets on an object-by-object basis, allowing us to cleanly isolate the impact of
different hydrodynamical methods on galaxy and halo properties. In accompanying
papers, we focus on an analysis of the global baryonic statistics predicted by
the simulation codes, (Vogelsberger et al. 2011) and complementary idealized
simulations that highlight the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes
(Sijacki et al. 2011). Here we investigate their influence on the baryonic
properties of simulated galaxies and their surrounding haloes. We find that
AREPO leads to significantly higher star formation rates for galaxies in
massive haloes and to more extended gaseous disks in galaxies, which also
feature a thinner and smoother morphology than their GADGET counterparts.
Consequently, galaxies formed in AREPO have larger sizes and higher specific
angular momentum than their SPH correspondents. The more efficient cooling
flows in AREPO yield higher densities and lower entropies in halo centers (and
the opposite trend in halo outskirts) leading to higher star formation rates of
massive galaxies. While both codes agree to acceptable accuracy on a number of
baryonic properties of cosmic structures, our results clearly demonstrate that
galaxy formation simulations greatly benefit from the use of more accurate
hydrodynamical techniques such as AREPO.

scattering angle in c.m. frame. This indicates that HHC does not hold and that
the pQCD limit is still not reached in the energy regime of this experiment.

seven Suzaku observations of the Sy 1.5 galaxy NGC 5548 taken over a period of
eight weeks. We conclude that the source has a moderately ionized, three-zone
warm absorber, a power-law continuum, and exhibits contributions from cold,
distant reflection. Relativistic reflection signatures are not significantly
detected in the co-added data, and we place an upper limit on the equivalent
width of a relativistically broad Fe K line at EW \leq 26 eV at 90% confidence.
Thus NGC 5548 can be labeled an ""weak"" type-1 AGN in terms of its observed
inner disk reflection signatures, in contrast to sources with very broad,
strong iron lines such as MCG-6-30-15, which are likely much fewer in number.
We compare physical properties of NGC 5548 and MCG-6-30-15 that might explain
this difference in their reflection properties. Though there is some evidence
that NGC 5548 may harbor a truncated inner accretion disk, this evidence is
inconclusive, so we also consider light bending of the hard X-ray continuum
emission in order to explain the lack of relativistic reflection in our
observation. If the absence of a broad Fe K line is interpreted in the
light-bending context, we conclude that the source of the hard X-ray continuum
lies at <100 gravitational radii. We note, however, that light-bending models
must be expanded to include a broader range of physical parameter space in
order to adequately explain the spectral and timing properties of average AGN,
rather than just those with strong, broad iron lines.

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The WD is destructed and accreted onto the
more massive core. In the CD scenario the rapidly rotating WD is formed shortly
after the stellar formation episode, and the delay from stellar formation to
explosion is basically determined by the spin-down time of the rapidly rotating
merger remnant. The spin-down is due to the magneto-dipole radiation torque.
Several properties of the CD scenario make it attractive compared with the
double-degenerate (DD) scenario. (1) Off-center ignition of carbon during the
merger process is not likely to occur. (2) No large envelope is formed. Hence
avoiding too much mass loss that might bring the merger remnant below the
critical mass. (3) This model explains the finding that more luminous SNe Ia
occur preferentially in star forming galaxies.

potential loss in spatial reuse due to the increased radio footprint of flows

develop a mechanism for the systematic and computational development of

superintegrable and also with a $su(2)$ nonAbelian monopole interaction

oscillator by a Hurwitz transformation. We introduce a new superintegrable
Hamiltonian that consists in a 5D Kepler system with new terms of
Smorodinsky-Winternitz type. We obtain the integrals of motion of this systems.
They generate a quadratic algebra with structure constants involving the
Casimir operator of a $so(4)$ Lie algebra. We also show that this system
remains superintegrable with a $su(2)$ nonAbelian monopole (generalized
Yang-Coulomb monopole). We study this system using parabolic coordinates and
obtain from Hurwitz transformation its dual that is a 8D singular oscillator.
This 8D singular oscillator is also a new superintegrable system and
multiseparable. We obtained its quadratic algebra that involves two Casimir
operators of $so(4)$ Lie algebras. This correspondence is used to obtain
algebraically the energy spectrum of the generalized Yang Coulomb monopole.

toughness, scattering number, integrity, tenacity, rupture degree and
edge-analogues of some of them. Among these parameters, the tenacity and
rupture degree are two better ones to measure the stability of a network. In
this paper we consider two extremal problems on the tenacity of graphs:
Determine the minimum and maximum tenacity of graphs with given order and size.
We give a complete solution to the first problem, while for the second one, it
turns out that the problem is much more complicated than that of the minimum
case. We determine the maximum tenacity of trees and unicyclic graphs with
given order and show the corresponding extremal graphs. These results are
helpful in constructing stable networks with lower costs. The paper concludes
with a discussion of a related problem on the edge vulnerability parameters of

sufficient energy from the optical field to overcome the large energy barrier

studies and interests in parametric amplification of small forces,
optomechanical backaction is also projected to open new windows for studying
discrete mechanical states, and to foster applications. Here we realize a
non-volatile mechanical memory element, in which bits are written and reset via
optomechanical backaction by controlling the mechanical damping across the

broadband photometry from the MUSYC survey, we identify a complete sample of

observers-frame equivalent widths greater than ~ 80 Angstroms (i.e., 20
Angstroms in the rest-frame of Ly-alpha). The bright-end of this dataset is
dominated by x-ray sources and foreground objects with GALEX detections, but
when these interlopers are removed, we are still left with a sample of 130 LAE
candidates, 39 of which have spectroscopic confirmations. This sample overlaps
the set of objects found in an earlier ECDF-S survey, but due to our filter's
redder bandpass, it also includes 68 previously uncataloged sources. We confirm
earlier measurements of the z=3.1 LAE emission-line luminosity function, and
show that an apparent anti-correlation between equivalent width and continuum
brightness is likely due to the effect of correlated errors in our
heteroskedastic dataset. Finally, we compare the properties of z=3.1 LAEs to
LAEs found at z=2.1. We show that in the ~1 Gyr after z~3, the LAE luminosity
function evolved significantly, with L* fading by ~0.4 mag, the number density

results from the combined effect of innumerable local perturbations, due to

smoothly-inhomogeneous adjustment of the FRW metric, in a process governed by
the causal flow of inhomogeneity information outward from each clumped system.
We discuss several arguments from the literature claiming to place sharp limits

are not applicable in a physically realistic cosmological analysis. A selection
of simply-parameterized models are presented, including several which are
capable of fitting the luminosity distance data from Type Ia supernovae

these models can reproduce measured cosmological parameters such as the age of

deceleration parameter, and the angular scale of the Cosmic Microwave
Background to within a reasonable proximity of their Concordance values. We
conclude by considering potential observational signatures for distinguishing

possible long-term fate of such a universe with ever-spreading spheres of

discrete Schroedinger equations. First we study pairs of discrete Schroedinger
equations whose potential functions differ by a quantity that can be considered
small in a suitable sense as the index n \rightarrow \infty. With simple
assumptions on the growth rate of the solutions of the original system, we show
that the perturbed system has a fundamental set of solutions with the same
behavior at infinity, employing a variation-of-constants scheme to produce a
convergent iteration for the solutions of the second equation in terms of those
of the original one. We use the relations between the solution sets to derive
exponential dichotomy of solutions and elucidate the structure of transfer
matrices.
  Later, we present a sharp discrete analogue of the Liouville-Green (WKB)
transformation, making it possible to derive exponential behavior at infinity
of a single difference equation, by explicitly constructing a comparison
equation to which our perturbation results apply. In addition, we point out an

factorization of the cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_{2^nr}$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$
where both $r \geq 3$ and $q$ are odd, $\gcd(q,r) = 1$, and $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
Previously, only the special cases when $r = 1,\ 3,\ 5$ had been achieved. For
this we make the assumption that the explicit factorization of $\Phi_r$ over
$\mathbb{F}_q$ is given to us as a known. Let $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}...
p_s^{e_s}$ be the factorization of $n \in \mathbb{N}$ into powers of distinct
primes $p_i,\ 1\leq i \leq s$. In the case that the orders of $q$ modulo all
these prime powers $p_i^{e_i}$ are pairwise coprime we show how to obtain the
explicit factors of $\Phi_{n}$ from the factors of each $\Phi_{p_i^{e_i}}$. We
also demonstrate how to obtain the factorization of $\Phi_{mn}$ from the
factorization of $\Phi_n$ when $q$ is a primitive root modulo $m$ and
$\gcd(m,n) = \gcd(\phi(m),\ord_n(q)) = 1$. Here $\phi$ is the Euler's totient
function, and $\ord_n(q)$ denotes the multiplicative order of $q$ modulo $n$.
Moreover, we present the construction of a new class of irreducible polynomials
over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and generalize a result due to Varshamov (1984)

|A+A| given the uniform distribution on subsets A of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. They
also conjectured the existence of a limiting distribution for |A+A| and showed
that the expectation of |A+A| is 2n - 11 + O((3/4)^{n/2}). Zhao proved that the
limits m(k) := lim_{n --> oo} Prob(2n-1-|A+A|=k) exist, and that sum_{k >= 0}

  We continue this program and give exponentially decaying upper and lower
bounds on m(k), and sharp bounds on m(k) for small k. Surprisingly, the
distribution is at least bimodal; sumsets have an unexpected bias against
missing exactly 7 sums. The proof of the latter is by reduction to questions on
the distribution of related random variables, with large scale numerical
computations a key ingredient in the analysis. We also derive an explicit
formula for the variance of |A+A| in terms of Fibonacci numbers, finding
Var(|A+A|) is approximately 35.9658. New difficulties arise in the form of weak
dependence between events of the form {x in A+A}, {y in A+A}. We surmount these
obstructions by translating the problem to graph theory. This approach also
yields good bounds on the probability for A+A missing a consecutive block of

periods (~day) suggest that tidal dissipation in such stars is not too
efficient so that these planets can survive against rapid orbital decay. This
is consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of
planet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from
stellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin
effects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such
systems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also
show that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital
axes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may
be explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation
in the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the
survival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type
parent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing
the damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing
orbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential
contains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency
(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves
in the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves
then leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By
contrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since
the tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We
derive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,
taking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different
tidal forcing components.

is attractive near the horizon and is repulsive far away from the black hole

subsequently can be expressed in terms of the non-truncated form of the

not occur within a distinct host galaxy but lie a great distance apart from

host-lessness of a fraction of reported SNe, namely (i) a host galaxy which is
too faint to be detected within the limits of currently available surveys or
(ii) a hypervelocity star (HVS) as progenitor of the SN,we want to distinguish
between these two cases. To do so, we use deep imaging to test explanation (i).
If within our detection limit of 27 mag/arcsec^2, the central surface
brightness of the faintest known LSB galaxy so far, no galaxy could be
identified, we discard this explanation and regard the SN, after several other
checks, to have had a hypervelocity star progenitor. Analyzing a selected
subsample of five host-less SNe we find one, SN 2006bx in UGC5434, to be put in
the hypervelocity progenitor category with a high probability, exhibiting a
projected velocity of > 800 km/s. SN 1969L in NGC1058 is most likely an example
for a very extended star-forming disk visible only in the far-UV, not in the
optical wavebands. Therefore this SN is clearly due to in situ star formation.
This mechanism may also apply for two other SNe we investigated (SN 1970L and
SN 1997C), but this cannot be determined with final certainty. Another one, SN
2005nc associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB 050525), is a special case not
covered by our initial assumptions. Even with deep Hubble data, a host galaxy
could not be unambiguously identified.

Keplerian discs in toroidally-dominated magnetic fields is treated by

leads to three regimes of non-exponential growth of perturbations, which are
classified according to different relative levels of the in-plane and axial
perturbed velocities. The first two regimes of instability are characterized by
the decoupling of the magneto-sonic (MS) and inertia-Coriolis (IC) modes, as
well as by algebraic temporal growth of the perturbations, which are driven by
either MS or IC modes (hereafter MS - and IC -regimes of instability,
respectively). The third, mixed IC-MS regime of non-exponential, non-algebraic
growth is due only to nonaxisymmetric perturbations. The latter regime is
characterized by high radial and azimuthal wavenumbers, and growth time of the
order of tens of rotating periods. The mixed IC-MS regime most likely exhibits
the maximal growth as compared with the IC- and MS- regimes. In the first two
regimes of instability the compressible MS mode plays a principal role either
as the driver of the growth or the driven growing mode, while the mixed IC-MS
regime is described by the Bousinesq approximation for incompressible fluid.
The latter is obtained as a natural limit of the expansion scheme. The presence
of magnetic field in the mixed IC- MS regime may drastically increase the
growth rates of the perturbations as compared with the pure hydrodynamic
system.

Rational investors form expectations on the return and risk of a risky asset

respect to their allocation on the risky asset versus the risk-free asset.
Noise traders are subjected to social imitation and follow momentum trading.
Allowing for random time-varying herding propensity, we are able to reproduce
several well-known stylized facts of financial markets such as a fat-tail
distribution of returns and volatility clustering. In particular, we observe
transient faster-than-exponential bubble growth with approximate log-periodic
behavior and give analytical arguments why this follows from our framework. The
model accounts well for the behavior of traders and for the price dynamics that
developed during the dotcom bubble in 1995-2000. Momentum strategies are shown
to be transiently profitable, supporting these strategies as enhancing herding
behavior.

  in a special issue of Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Particle acceleration in massive star forming regions can proceed via a large
variety of possible emission scenarios, including high-energy gamma-ray
production in the colliding wind zone of the massive Wolf-Rayet binary (here WR
20a and WR 121a), collective wind scenarios, diffusive shock acceleration at
the boundaries of wind-blown bubbles in the stellar cluster, and outbreak
phenomena from hot stellar winds into the interstellar medium. In view of the
recent Fermi-LAT detection of HESS J1023-575 (in the vicinity of Westerlund 2),
we examine another very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray source, HESS J1848-0145 (in
the vicinity of W43), possibly associated with a massive star cluster.
Considering multi-wavelength data, in particular TeV gamma-rays, we examine the
available evidence that the gamma-ray emission coincident with Westerlund 2 and
W43 could originate in particles accelerated by the above-mentioned mechanisms
in massive star clusters.

quasi-local energy expression requires a proper choice of reference spacetime.
We propose a program for determining the reference by embedding a neighborhood
of the two-sphere boundary in the dynamic spacetime into a Minkowski reference,
so that the two sphere is embedded isometrically, and then extremizing the
energy to determine the embedding variables. Applying this idea to
Schwarzschild spacetime, we found that for each given future timelike
displacement vector our program gives a unique energy value. The static
observer measures the maximal energy. Applied to the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime, we find that the maximum energy
value is nonnegative; the associated displacement vector is the unit dual mean
curvature vector, and the expansion of the two-sphere boundary matches that of
its reference image. For these spherically symmetric cases the reference
determined by our program is equivalent to isometrically matching the geometry
at the two-sphere boundary and taking the displacement vector to be orthogonal
to the spacelike constant coordinate time hypersurface, like the timelike
Killing vector of the Minkowski reference.

based on modified gravity has been proposed recently. By virtue of this
mechanism the effect of the vacuum energy density of a given quantum
field/string theory (no matter how big is its initial value in the early
universe) can be neutralized dynamically, i.e. without fine tuning, and hence a
Big Bang-like evolution of the cosmos becomes possible. Remarkably, a large
class F^n_m of models of this kind, namely capable of dynamically adjusting the
vacuum energy irrespective of its value and size, has been identified. In this
paper, we carefully put them to the experimental test. By performing a joint
likelihood analysis we confront these models with the most recent observational
data on type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the
Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the high redshift data on the
expansion rate, so as to determine which ones are the most favored by
observations. We compare the optimal relaxation models F^n_m found by this
method with the standard or concordance LambdaCDM model, and find that some of
these models may appear as almost indistinguishable from it. Interestingly
enough, this shows that it is possible to construct viable solutions to the
tough cosmological fine tuning problem with models that display the same basic
phenomenological features as the concordance model.

always a relative angle of propagation regarding to that of the magnetic-field

in transit timing. We acquired high-precision light curves for four transits of
WASP-10 b in 2010. Assuming various limb-darkening laws, we generated best-fit
models and redetermined parameters of the system. The prayer-bead method and
Monte Carlo simulations were used to derive error estimates. Three transit
light curves exhibit signatures of the occultations of dark spots by the planet
during its passage across the stellar disk. The influence of stellar activity
on transit depth is taken into account while determining system parameters. The
radius of WASP-10 b is found to be no greater than 1.03 Jupiter radii, a value
significantly smaller than most previous studies indicate. We calculate
interior structure models of the planet, assuming a two-layer structure with
one homogeneous envelope atop a rock core. The high value of the WASP-10 b's
mean density allows one to consider the planet's internal structure including
270 to 450 Earth masses of heavy elements. Our new mid-transit times confirm
that transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period if all literature

Wavelength options between 3.2 and 5.7 {\AA} are available for unpolarized and
polarized neutrons. Spin polarization and analysis are achieved by magnetized
transmission supermirrors and radio-frequency adiabatic spin flippers. As a
result of vertical focusing by the five-element (pyrolytic graphite)
monochromator the reflected intensity from a 20x20 mm sample has doubled. GINA
is dedicated to studies of magnetic films and heterostructures, but unpolarized
options for non-magnetic films, membranes and other surfaces are also provided.
Shortly after its startup, reflectivity values as low as 3x10-5 have been
measured on the instrument. The facility is now open for the international user
community, but its development is continuing mainly to establish new sample
environment options, the spin analysis of off-specularly scattered radiation
and further decrease of the background.

which hop and interact with each other, is described at both micro- and
mesoscopic levels. The states of the system are probability measures on the
space of configurations of particles. For a bounded time interval $[0,T)$, the
evolution of states $\mu_0 \mapsto \mu_t$ is shown to hold in a space of
sub-Poissonian measures. This result is obtained by: (a) solving equations for
correlation functions, which yields the evolution $k_0 \mapsto k_t$, $t\in
[0,T)$, in a scale of Banach spaces; (b) proving that each $k_t$ is a
correlation function for a unique measure $\mu_t$. The mesoscopic theory is
based on a Vlasov-type scaling, that yields a mean-field-like approximate
description in terms of the particles' density which obeys a kinetic equation.
The latter equation is rigorously derived from that for the correlation
functions by the scaling procedure. We prove that the kinetic equation has a
unique solution $\varrho_t$, $t\in [0,+\infty)$.

the turbulence strength agrees with previous analytical and numerical research
on the turbulence induced by Kelvin-Helmholtz and/or streaming instabilities
for particles whose stopping time is less than the Keplerian time. For such
small particles, the strongest turbulence is expected to occur when the
dust-to-gas ratio of the disk is ~C_eff^(1/2) (h_g / r) ~ 10^(-2), where C_eff
~ 0.2 represents the energy supply efficiency to turbulence and h_g / r ~ 5 x

Rotation gradients are a very important way of investigating these magnetic
fields, and can provide information on the orientation and structure of the
magnetic field in the immediate vicinity of the jet; for example, a toroidal or
helical field component should give rise to a systematic gradient in the
observed Faraday rotation across the jet, as well as characteristic intensity
and polarization profiles. However, real observed radio images have finite
resolution, usually expressed via convolution with a Gaussian beam whose size
corresponds to the central lobe of the point source response function. This
will tend to blur transverse structure in the jet profile, raising the question
of how well resolved a jet must be in the transverse direction in order to
reliably detect transverse structure associated with a helical jet magnetic

also suggested on the basis of the modelling the spectral energy distribution

calculated column density of the neutral hydrogen atoms in the neutral

the hot star are in a good agreement with quantities derived from observations

transient, being connected with the active phases of symbiotic binaries. During

themselves, over time they form a community on a macroscopic scale. This
phenomenon can be understood in the context of percolation transition (PT) of
networks, which takes place continuously in the classical random graph model.
Recently, a modified model was introduced in which the formation of the
community was suppressed. Then the PT occurs explosively at a delayed
transition time. Whether the explosive PT is indeed discontinuous or continuous
becomes controversial. Here we show that type of PT depends on a detailed
dynamic rule. Thus, when the dynamic rule is designed to suppress the growth of
overall clusters, then the explosive PT could be discontinuous.

called the net of causal loops, is constructed by selecting a suitable base K
encoding causal and symmetry properties of the spacetime. Considering K as a
partially ordered set (poset) with respect to the inclusion order relation, we
define groups of closed paths (loops) formed by the elements of K. These groups
come equipped with a causal disjointness relation and an action of the symmetry
group of the spacetime. In this way the local algebras of the net are the group
C*-algebras of the groups of loops, quotiented by the causal disjointness
relation. We also provide a geometric interpretation of a class of
representations of this net in terms of causal and covariant connections of the
poset K. In the case of the Minkowski spacetime, we prove the existence of
Poincar\'e covariant representations satisfying the spectrum condition. This is
obtained by virtue of a remarkable feature of our construction: any Hermitian
scalar quantum field defines causal and covariant connections of K. Similar
results hold for the chiral spacetime $S^1$ with conformal symmetry.

using e+e--annihilation into jets and vector boson production in hadronic
collisions, with special attention to details in the algorithm which are
formally sub-leading in character, but may have visible effects in some

enforced rapidity ordering in the default PYTHIA8 shower. If this rapidity
ordering is removed the merging scale dependence is almost negligible. We then
also find that the shower does a surprisingly good job of describing the
hardness of multi-jet events, as long as the hardest couple of jets are given
by the matrix elements. The effects of using interleaved multiple interactions

desirable and remains challenging. A novel approach to a loophole-free Bell
tests is based on amplification of the entangled photons, i.e.\@ on macroscopic
entanglement, which optical signal should be easy to detect. However, the
macroscopic states are partially indistinguishable by the classical detectors.
An interesting idea to overcome these limitations is to replace the
postselection by an appropriate preselection immediately after the
amplification. This is in the spirit of state preprocessing revealing hidden
nonlocality. Here, we examine one of possible preselections, but the presented
tools can be used for analysis of other schemes. Filtering methods making the

the four dimensional space-time without changing original theory. Though the
one-loop amplitude of $H\to \gamma\gamma$ is finite as the Higgs boson in the

scheme can ensure the consistency conditions between the regularized
tensor-type and scalar-type divergent irreducible loop integrals to preserve
gauge invariance, we explicitly show the absence of decoupling in the limit
$M_W/M_H\to0$ and obtain a result agreed exactly with the earlier one in the

with techniques such as cluster abundance, cosmic shear correlations or baryon

more moderate volumes with the cross-correlation of photometric and
spectroscopic surveys. We consider the angular galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation in
narrow redshift bins and its combination with different probes of weak
gravitational lensing (WL) and redshift space distortions (RSD). Including the
cross-correlation of these surveys improves by factors of a few the constraints
on both the dark energy equation of state w(z) and the cosmic growth history,
parametrized by \gamma. The additional information comes from using many narrow
redshift bins and from galaxy bias, which is measured both with WL probes and
RSD, breaking degeneracies that are present when using each method separately.
We show forecasts for a joint w(z) and \gamma figure of merit using linear
scales over a deep (i<24) photometric survey and a brighter (i<22.5)
spectroscopic or very accurate (0.3%) photometric redshift survey.
Magnification or shear in the photometric sample produce FoM that are of the
same order of magnitude of those of RSD or BAO over the spectroscopic sample.
However, the cross-correlation of these probes over the same area yields a FoM
that is up to a factor 100 times larger. Magnification alone, without shape
measurements, can also be used for these cross-correlations and can produce
better results than using shear alone. For a spectroscopic follow-up survey
strategy, measuring the spectra of the foreground lenses to perform this
cross-correlation provides 5 times better FoM than targeting the higher
redshift tail of the galaxy distribution to study BAO over a 2.5 times larger
volume.

to widely differing implications for policy. A lack of clarity about which
factors are responsible reinforces policy inaction. Here, for the first time,
we construct a dynamic model that quantitatively agrees with food prices. The
results show that the dominant causes of price increases are investor
speculation and ethanol conversion. Models that just treat supply and demand
are not consistent with the actual price dynamics. The two sharp peaks in
2007/2008 and 2010/2011 are specifically due to investor speculation, while an
underlying upward trend is due to increasing demand from ethanol conversion.
The model includes investor trend following as well as shifting between
commodities, equities and bonds to take advantage of increased expected
returns. Claims that speculators cannot influence grain prices are shown to be
invalid by direct analysis of price setting practices of granaries. Both causes
of price increase, speculative investment and ethanol conversion, are promoted
by recent regulatory changes---deregulation of the commodity markets, and
policies promoting the conversion of corn to ethanol. Rapid action is needed to
reduce the impacts of the price increases on global hunger.

understanding of structure formation and evolution of planetary nebulae
including their interaction with the interstellar medium. New propositions have
been made for the formation mechanism of multi-polar PNe and PPNe. These
mechanisms are based on the central engine with interacting binary stars or
hole producing instabilities in expanding shock waves leading to illumination
effects from the central star that change the appearance of the nebula.
Furthermore, there has been a lot of progress in the observation and 3D
modeling of the kinematics, which is key to the understanding of the dynamics.
Extensive observational catalogs are coming online for the kinematics, as well
as some very detailed proper motion measurements have been made. New techniques
for morpho--kinematic 3D modeling help to make the interpretation of kinematic
data more reliable and detailed. In addition to individual pointed
observations, new surveys have lead to the discovery of many PNe that show
clear signs of interaction with the interstellar medium. Systematic
hydrodynamic models of the interaction have produced a general scheme for the
observed structure that results from the interaction of an evolving planetary
nebula with the ISM. Detailed modeling of the dust-gas dynamics during the
interaction with the ISM have produced interesting predictions for future IR
observations. Detailed models were worked out for the structure of the bowshock
and tail of Mira that was recently discovered in the UV.

matrices and the corresponding spacings of the non trivial zeros of the Riemann
zeta function is analyzed on the basis of the geometric dynamical global
program of Langlands whose fundamental structures are shifted quantized
conjugacy class representatives of bilinear algebraic semigroups.The considered
symmetry behind this phenomenology is the differential bilinear Galois
semigroup shifting the product,right by left,of automorphism semigroups of
cofunctions and functions on compact transcendental quanta.

that differs fundamentally from both the corresponding classical and quantum
theories, while exhibiting certain features common to both. Such theories are
of interest for two primary reasons. Firstly, NCQs arise prominently in
semi-classical approximation schemes. Their formal study may yield improved
approximation techniques in the near-classical regime. More importantly for the
purposes of this note, it may be possible for NCQs to reproduce quantum results
over experimentally tested regimes while having a well defined classical limit,
and hence are viable alternative theories. We illustrate an NCQ by considering
an explicit class of NCQ mechanics. Here this class will be arrived at via a
natural generalization of classical mechanics formulated in terms of a
probability density functional.
