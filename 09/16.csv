motion of cosmic fluids on their small-scale evolution. This approach consists
in collecting the impact of the long-wavelength displacement field into a
single or finite number of random variables, whose statistical properties can
be computed from the initial conditions. For a single dark matter fluid, we
show that we can recover the nonlinear propagators of renormalized perturbation
theory. These are obtained with no need to assume that the displacement field
follows the linear theory. Then we extend the eikonal approximation to many
fluids. In particular, we study the case of two non-relativistic components and
we derive their resummed propagators in the presence of isodensity modes.
Unlike the adiabatic case, where only the phase of small-scale modes is
affected by the large-scale advection field, the isodensity modes change also
the amplitude on small scales. We explicitly solve the case of cold dark
matter-baryon mixing and find that the isodensity modes induce only very small
corrections to the resummed propagators.

Candidate EOSs can be approximated by a parametrized piecewise-polytropic EOS
above nuclear density, matched to a fixed low-density EOS; and we report
results from a large set of BHNS inspiral simulations that systematically vary
two parameters. To within the accuracy of the simulations, we find that, apart
from the neutron-star mass, a single physical parameter Lambda, describing its
deformability, can be extracted from the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown
waveform. This parameter is related to the radius, mass, and l=2 Love number,
k_2, of the neutron star by Lambda = 2k_2 R^5/3M_{NS}^5, and it is the same
parameter that determines the departure from point-particle dynamics during the
early inspiral. Observations of gravitational waves from BHNS inspiral thus
restrict the EOS to a surface of constant Lambda in the parameter space,
thickened by the measurement error. Using various configurations of a single
Advanced LIGO detector, we find that neutron stars are distinguishable from
black holes of the same mass and that Lambda^{1/5} or equivalently R can be
extracted to 10-40% accuracy from single events for mass ratios of Q=2 and 3 at
a distance of 100 Mpc, while with the proposed Einstein Telescope, EOS

an increasing feeling within the weak lensing community that other disciplines,

1, 2003. Excellent set of high resolution observations made by RHESSI and TRACE
provide clear evidence of significant pre-flare activities for ~9 minutes in
the form of an initiation phase observed at EUV/UV wavelengths followed by the
X-ray precursor phase. During the initiation phase, we observed localized
brightenings in the highly sheared core region close to the filament and
interactions among short EUV loops overlying the filament which led to the
opening of magnetic field lines. The X-ray precursor phase is manifested in
RHESSI measurements below ~30 keV and coincided with the beginning of flux
emergence at the flaring location along with early signatures of the eruption.
From the RHESSI observations, we conclude that both plasma heating and electron
acceleration occurred during the precursor phase. The main flare is consistent
with the standard flare model. However, after the impulsive phase, intense HXR
looptop source was observed without significant footpoint emission. More
intriguingly, for a brief period the looptop source exhibited strong HXR
emission with energies up to 100 keV and significant non-thermal
characteristics. The present study indicates a causal relation between the
activities in the preflare and main flare. We also conclude that pre-flare
activities, occurred in the form of subtle magnetic reorganization along with
localized magnetic reconnection, played a crucial role in destabilizing the
active region filament leading to solar eruptive flare and associated
large-scale phenomena.

K\""ahlerian structure. Consider a strongly continuous action $\alpha$ of
$\mathbb B$ on a Fr\'echet algebra $\mathcal A$. Denote by $\mathcal A^\infty$
the associated Fr\'echet algebra of smooth vectors for the action $\alpha$. In
the Abelian case $\mathbb B=\mathbb R^{2n}$ and $\alpha$ isometric, Marc
Rieffel proved that Weyl's operator symbol composition formula yields a
deformation through Fr\'echet algebra structures
${\star_{\theta}^\alpha}_{\theta\in\mathbb R}$ on $\mathcal A^\infty$. When
$\mathcal A$ is a $C^\star$-algebra, every deformed algebra $(\mathcal
A^\infty,\star^\alpha_\theta)$ admits a compatible pre-$C^\star$-structure. In
this paper, we prove both analogous statements in the general negatively curved
K\""ahlerian group and (non-isometric) ""tempered"" action case. The construction
relies on the one hand on combining a non-Abelian version of oscillatory
integral on tempered Lie groups with geometrical objects coming from invariant
WKB-quantization of solvable symplectic symmetric spaces, and, on the second
hand, in establishing a non-Abelian version of the Calder\`on-Vaillancourt
Theorem. In particular, we give an oscillating kernel formula for WKB-star
products on symplectic symmetric spaces that fiber over an exponential Lie
group.

Second harmonic generation is due to a combination of symmetry breaking, the
magnetic portion of the Lorentz force, and quadrupolar contributions that
impart peculiar features to the angular dependence of the generated signals, in
analogy to what occurs in metals. The material is assumed to have a non-zero,
third order nonlinearity that gives rise to most of the third harmonic signal.
Using the parameters of bulk Silicon we predict that cavity environments can
significantly modify second harmonic generation (390nm) with dramatic
improvements for third harmonic generation (266nm). This occurs despite the
fact that the harmonics may be tuned to a wavelength range where the dielectric
function of the material is negative: a phase locking mechanism binds the pump
to the generated signals and inhibits their absorption. These results point the
way to novel uses and flexibility of materials like Silicon as nonlinear media
in the visible and UV ranges.

validated by encouraging experimental results on four large-scale document data
sets. Furthermore, the BP algorithm has the potential to become a generic

is an essential ingredient in, for example, the modeling of the Schwinger-Dyson
equation used to describe hadronic phenomenology. From the Landau gauge gluon
propagator, computed with lattice QCD methods, we discuss its interpretation as
a massive propagator and measure the gluon mass as a function of the momenta.
Special attention is given to the mass at infrared scales. In the last part of
the talk, the gluon mass and chiral symmetry breaking are related via an
effective model for QCD.

parity-odd medium is bounded by a hyperplane separating it from the vacuum. The
solutions in both half-spaces are carefully discussed and in the case of
space-like boundary stitched on the boundary with help of the Bogolubov
transformations provided by the space-like Chern-Simons vector. The presence of
two different Fock vacua is shown and the probability amplitude for
transmission of particles from vacuum to parity breaking medium is calculated.
We have also found classical solutions and showed that the results are
consistent with ones obtained by canonical quantization formalism. In the
cases, both of entrance to and of escaping from parity-odd medium, the
probabilities for reflecting and passing through were found for each

Submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant
quasars observed is largely unknown. One hypothesis is that they grew rapidly
from intermediate-mass seeds (~100 M_sun) left by the first stars. However,
some previous studies argued that accretion onto these black holes was too low
to build up the mass due to strong suppression by radiative feedback. Here, we
re-exam the accretion process of such a black hole embedded in a primordial gas
cloud, by considering a wide range of physical and numerical parameters not
explored before. We find that, while radiative heating and pressure indeed
suppress accretion effectively, self-gravity of the gas eventually overcomes
the feedback effects and boosts the accretion to the Eddington rate after one
free-fall timescale of the cloud. Moreover, for a given black hole mass, there
exists a critical density above which the accretion can reach Eddington limit.
Furthermore, we find a universal correlation between black hole accretion rate
and ambient gas density, which may serve as a realistic recipe for black hole
growth in simulations.

has been widely used to study various elementary excitations in correlated and

boosting the overall signal the dependence of the resonant profile on incident

indirect RIXS, such as Cu K-edge for example where scattering takes place only
via the core-hole created as an intermediate state, with the charge dynamical

relevant to indirect RIXS in correlated materials, such as high Tc cuprates. We
demonstrate that RIXS spectra can be reduced to S(q,\omega) when there is no
screening channel for the core-hole potential in the intermediate state. We
also show that two-magnon excitations are highlighted at the resonant photon
energy when the core-hole potential in the corresponding intermediate state is
poorly screened. Our results demonstrate that different elementary excitations

Br-gamma line geometry with a near-critical rotating stellar photosphere and a

the disk position angle (140+/-1.7 deg), inclination (38.5+/-1 deg), and the
mass of the central star (3.5+/-0.2 M_sun). As a second target star, we
observed the prototypical Be star Zeta Tauri and spatially resolved the
Br{\gamma} emission as well as nine transitions from the hydrogen Pfund series

find that the Brackett (Br-gamma), Pfund (Pf14-17), and Balmer (H-alpha) lines
originate from different stellocentric radii (R_cont < R_Pf < R_Br-gamma =
R_H-alpha), which we can reproduce with an LTE line radiative transfer
computation. Discussing different disk-formation scenarios, we conclude that
our constraints are inconsistent with wind compression models predicting a

produced by a relativistic ejecta coasting in a \rho ~ r^{-2}, wind-like
medium; no energy injection into the shock is needed. After the ejecta collects
enough medium and transitions to the adiabatic, decelerating blastwave phase,
it produces the post-plateau decay. For those bursts consistent with this
model, we find an upper limit for the initial Lorentz factor of the ejecta,
\Gamma_0 \leq 46 (\epsilon_e/0.1)^{-0.24} (\epsilon_B/0.01)^{0.17}; the
isotropic equivalent total ejecta energy is E_{iso} ~ 10^{53}

progenitor stars of some GRBs. It raises intriguing questions about the origin
of an intermediate-\Gamma_0 ejecta, which we speculate is connected to the GRB
jet emergence from its host star. For the remaining 45% of the sample, the
post-plateau decline is too rapid to be explained in the coasting-in-wind
model, and energy injection appears to be required.

was proposed and the phenomenology studied for the Bianchi type I spacetime. It
was found that the model demonstrates a counter-example to the cosmic no-hair
theorem since there exists a stable anisotropically inflationary fix-point. One
of the great triumphs of inflation, however, is that it explains the observed
flatness and isotropy of the universe today without requiring special initial
conditions. Any acceptable model for inflation should thus explain these
observations in a satisfactory way. To check whether the model meets this
requirement, we introduce curvature to the background geometry and consider
axisymmetric spacetimes of Bianchi type II,III and the Kantowski-Sachs metric.
We show that the anisotropic Bianchi type I fix-point is an attractor for the
entire family of such spacetimes. The model is predictive in the sense that the
universe gets close to this fix-point after a few e-folds for a wide range of
initial conditions. If inflation lasts for N e-folds, the curvature at the end
of inflation is typically of order exp(-2N). The anisotropy in the expansion
rate at the end of inflation, on the other hand, while being small on the
one-percent level, is highly significant. We show that after the end of
inflation there will be a period of isotropization lasting for about 2N/3
e-folds. After that the shear scales as the curvature and becomes dominant
around N e-folds after the end of inflation. For plausible bounds on the reheat
temperature the minimum number of e-folds during inflation, required for
consistency with the isotropy of the supernova Ia data, lays in the interval
(21,48). Thus the results obtained for our restricted class of spacetimes
indicates that inflation with anisotropic hair is cosmologically viable.

observed bands from 4000{\deg}A to 6{\mu}m, as well as rest-frame photometry
and intrinsic properties of the galaxies. Guo et al. (2011) tuned their model
to fit the low-redshift galaxy population but noted that at z > 1 it
overpredicts the abundance of galaxies below the ""knee"" of the stellar mass
function. Here we extend the comparison to deep galaxy counts in the B, i, J, K
and IRAC 3.6{\mu}m, 4.5{\mu}m and 5.8{\mu}m bands, to the redshift
distributions of K and 5.8{\mu}m selected galaxies, and to the evolution of
rest-frame luminosity functions in the B and K bands. The B, i and J counts are
well reproduced, but at longer wavelengths the overabundant high-redshift
galaxies produce excess faint counts. The predicted redshift distributions for
K and 5.8{\mu}m selected samples highlight the effect of emission from
thermally pulsing AGB stars. The full treatment of Maraston (2005) predicts
three times as many z~2 galaxies in faint 5.8{\mu}m selected samples as the
model of Bruzual & Charlot (2003), whereas the two models give similar
predictions for K-band selected samples. Although luminosity functions are
adequately reproduced out to z~3 in rest-frame B, the same is true at
rest-frame K only if TP-AGB emission is included, and then only at high
luminosity. Fainter than L* the two synthesis models agree but overpredict the
number of galaxies, another reflection of the overabundance of ~10^10M\odot
model galaxies at z > 1.

termed bias -- in the LCDM framework. In particular, we examine the local model
of biasing at quadratic order in the matter density. This model is
characterized by parameters b_1 and b_2. Using an ensemble of N-body
simulations, we apply several statistical methods to estimate the parameters.
We measure halo and matter fluctuations smoothed on various scales and find
that the parameters vary with smoothing scale. We argue that, for real-space
measurements, owing to the mixing of wavemodes, no scale can be found for which
the parameters are independent of smoothing. However, this is not the case in
Fourier space. We measure halo power spectra and construct estimates for an
effective large-scale bias. We measure the configuration dependence of the halo
bispectra B_hhh and reduced bispectra Q_hhh for very large-scale k-space
triangles. From this we constrain b_1 and b_2. Using the lowest-order
perturbation theory, we find that for B_hhh the best-fit parameters are in
reasonable agreement with one another as the triangle scale is varied, but that
the fits become poor as smaller scales are included. The same is true for
Q_hhh. The best-fit parameters depend on the discreteness correction. This led
us to consider halo-mass cross-bispectra. The results from these statistics
support our earlier findings. We develop a test to explore the importance of
missing higher-order terms in the models. We prove that low-order expansions
are not able to correctly model the data, even on scales k_1~0.04 h/Mpc. If
robust inferences are to be drawn from galaxy surveys, then accurate models for
the full nonlinear matter bispectrum and trispectrum will be essential.

distributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what
is expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show that
neither (L/M)^s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by Kjeldsen & Bedding

relation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate
amplitudes from the main-sequence to red-giants to a precision of ~25%. The
residuals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an
additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observed
amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellar
activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is most
pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the location of the cool edge

introduce a generalized treatment for temperature variations in a dusty
environment, which is not limited to any specific astronomical source. The
treatment has been incorporated into a simplified clumpy torus model, with the
radial brightness distribution as the main parameter, to study the IR emission
of type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). We show that any variability signal in
the optical is smoothened stronger if the brightness distribution is very
extended, and this smoothing strongly depends on wavelength. This also affects
time lags between the optical and near-/mid-IR emission, which can be up to 10s
of sublimation radii for long wavelengths and extended brightness
distributions. The dependence of time lag on wavelength and distribution can be
used to quantify the brightness distribution in an AGN torus, either by
comparing optical light curves to near-IR and mid-IR light curves, or by
directly comparing near-IR to mid-IR light curves. Moreover, our model has been
applied to near-IR data of the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. We show that
the simple model can reproduce the overall observed variability signal and
found that about 40% of the energy in the variability signal in the V-band has
been converted into K-band variability. This low value may be explained by a
""snowball"" model of gradually-sublimating clouds at the inner edge of the
torus. We also note that our modeling does not support a change of time
lag/sublimation radius over the observed light curve epoch in spite of a
significant change in V-band emission.

spectrophotometric analysis of the massive stars and the nature of their

find evidence of an age spread of at least 2-3 Myr. While the most massive star
(IRS2) is already evolved, indications for high-mass pre-main-sequence
evolution is found for another star (IRS N1), deeply embedded in an ultra
compact HII region, in line with the different evolutionary phases observed in
the corresponding HII regions. We derive a stellar mass of W3 Main of (4 +- 1)
10^3 Msun, by extrapolating from the number of OB stars using a Kroupa IMF and
correcting for our spectroscopic incompleteness. We have detected the
photospheres of OB stars from the more evolved diffuse HII region to the much

Through a variety of numerical experiments we establish a clear link between
test problems and systematic numerical effects seen in cosmological simulations
of galaxy formation. Our tests demonstrate deficiencies of the SPH method in
several sectors. These accuracy problems not only manifest themselves in
idealized hydrodynamical tests, but also propagate to more realistic simulation
setups of galaxy formation, ultimately affecting gas properties in the full
cosmological framework, as highlighted in papers by Vogelsberger et al. (2011)
and Keres et al. (2011). We find that an inadequate treatment of fluid
instabilities in GADGET suppresses entropy generation by mixing, underestimates
vorticity generation in curved shocks and prevents efficient gas stripping from
infalling substructures. In idealized tests of inside-out disk formation, the
convergence rate of gas disk sizes is much slower in GADGET due to spurious
angular momentum transport. In simulations where we follow the interaction
between a forming central disk and orbiting substructures in a halo, the final
disk morphology is strikingly different. In AREPO, gas from infalling
substructures is readily depleted and incorporated into the host halo
atmosphere, facilitating the formation of an extended central disk. Conversely,
gaseous sub-clumps are more coherent in GADGET simulations, morphologically
transforming the disk as they impact it. The numerical artefacts of the SPH
solver are particularly severe for poorly resolved flows, and thus inevitably
affect cosmological simulations due to their hierarchical nature. Our numerical
experiments clearly demonstrate that AREPO delivers a physically more reliable
solution.

archival data available in this field, as well as acquired near-infrared (NIR)
adaptive optics (AO) imaging and NIR slit spectroscopy. The X-ray spectrum is
hard, implying a column density of several 10^23 cm^-2. Though heavily

absorption-corrected 2-10 keV luminosity of ~10^45 erg s^-1. Outflows driven by
an accretion disk may produce the double-peaked lines if the central engine
accretes near the Eddington limit. However, we may be seeing the narrow line

predict the existence of a multiverse containing many bubble universes. These
bubble universes will generically collide, and collisions with ours produce
cosmic wakes that enter our Hubble volume, appear as unusually symmetric disks
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and disturb large scale structure
(LSS). There is preliminary observational evidence consistent with one or more
of these disturbances on our sky. However, other sources can produce similar
features in the CMB temperature map and so additional signals are needed to
verify their extra-universal origin. Here we find, for the first time, the
detailed three-dimensional shape and CMB temperature and polarization signals
of the cosmic wake of a bubble collision in the early universe consistent with
current observations. The predicted polarization pattern has distinctive
features that when correlated with the corresponding temperature pattern are a
unique and striking signal of a bubble collision. These features represent the
first verifiable prediction of the multiverse paradigm and might be detected by
current experiments such as Planck and future CMB polarization missions. A
detection of a bubble collision would confirm the existence of the Multiverse,
provide compelling evidence for the string theory landscape, and sharpen our
picture of the Universe and its origins.

which was previously found to have strong X-ray emission and to be anomalously
bright for its spectral type. In this study we discuss these characteristics
using new information from quasi-simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic
monitoring. From photometric time series obtained with the 2.2m telescope on
Calar Alto we measure a period of ~4d for FU Tau A, most likely the rotation
period. The short-term variations over a few days are consistent with the
rotational modulation of the flux by cool, magnetically induced spots. In
contrast, the photometric variability on timescales of weeks and years can only
be explained by the presence of hot spots, presumably caused by accretion. The
hot spot properties are thus variable on timescales exceeding the rotation
period, maybe due to long-term changes in the accretion rate or geometry. The
new constraints from the analysis of the variability confirm that FU Tau A is
affected by magnetically induced spots and excess luminosity from accretion.
However, accretion is not sufficient to explain its anomalous position in the
HR diagram. In addition, suppressed convection due to magnetic activity and/or
an early evolutionary stage need to be invoked to fully account for the
observed properties. These factors cause considerable problems in estimating
the mass of FU Tau A and other objects in this mass/age regime, to the extent
that it appears questionable if it is feasible to derive the Initial Mass
Function for young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

spatial structure. In cosmology, it is used to quantify large-scale structure
(LSS) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This is because the power
spectrum completely quantifies Gaussian random fields, which the CMB and LSS
fields seem to be at early epochs. However, at late epochs and small scales,
cosmological density fields become highly non-Gaussian. The power spectrum
loses power to describe LSS and CMB fields on small scales, most obviously
through high covariance in the power spectrum as a function of scale.
Practically, this significantly degrades constraints that observations can
place on cosmological parameters. However, if a nonlinear transformation that
produces a (more) Gaussian 1-point distribution is applied to a field, the
extra covariance in the field's power spectrum can be dramatically reduced. In
the case of the roughly lognormal low-redshift matter density field, a log
transform accomplishes this. Applying a log transform to the density field
before measuring the power spectrum also tightens cosmological parameter
constraints by a factor of several.

V-R color measurements indicate that both the nucleus and dust are redder than
the Sun, with no significant color differences between the dust cloud's

search for CN emission, where we find CN and H2O production rates of Q(CN) <

reject them as being physically implausible. Instead, we concur with previous

three-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal

step, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our

APEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the

imply that the C&C mechanism is at work. Rather, we find a hybrid form of

equation describing two-phase flow in porous media. The MBL equation differs
from the classical Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation by including a balanced
diffusive-dispersive combination. The dispersive term is a third order mixed
derivatives term, which models the dynamic effects in the pressure difference
between the two phases. The classical BL equation gives a monotone water
saturation profile for any Riemann problem; on the contrast, when the
dispersive parameter is large enough, the MBL equation delivers non-monotone
water saturation profile for certain Riemann problems as suggested by the
experimental observations. In this paper, we first show that the solution of
the finite interval [0,L] boundary value problem converges to that of the
half-line [0,+\infty) boundary value problem for the MBL equation as L->
+\infty. This result provides a justification for the use of the finite
interval boundary value problem in numerical studies for the half line problem.
Furthermore, we extend the classical central schemes for the hyperbolic
conservation laws to solve the MBL equation which is of pseudo-parabolic type.
Numerical results confirm the existence of non-monotone water saturation
profiles consisting of constant states separated by shocks.

way of lowering the band gap in these conjugated systems. Our results highlight
the use of predictive calculations guided by rational chemical intuition for
designing low band gap polymers in photovoltaic materials.

years, when ground-based detectors make the first detections in the
high-frequency regime. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime produced by
the motions of massive objects such as black holes and neutron stars. Since the
universe is nearly transparent to gravitational waves, these signals carry
direct information about their sources - such as masses, spins, luminosity
distances, and orbital parameters - through dense, obscured regions across
cosmic time. This article explores gravitational waves as cosmic messengers,
highlighting key sources, detection methods, and the astrophysical payoffs
across the gravitational wave spectrum.

higher order contributions in the hybridization, we calculated analytically the
selfenergy in the presence of strong correlations.It is found that the Kondo
resonance takes place in a narrow energy range of the impurity level around the
Fermi energy which can be tuned by a gate voltage.We show that this range is
linear in the Fermi energy $|\mu|$ and is significantly narrower than in the
case for a normal metal.The origin of this behavior is traced back to the
inherent properties of graphene, especially its linear dispersion.The
singularity in the full Green's function is also analyzed with the help of a
transparent geometrical method.The relations between the various selfenergies
and the implications for the experimental observations are discussed .

experimental precision that scales with the charge state q. Neutron-deficient
Rb-isotopes have been charge bred in an electron beam ion trap to q = 8 - 12+

gains of 1-2 orders of magnitude. The method is particularly suited for
short-lived nuclides such as the superallowed {\beta} emitter 74Rb (T1/2 = 65

(GW) and electromagnetic (EM) channels would yield rich scientific rewards. A
first program initiating EM follow-ups to possible transient GW events has been
developed and exercised by the LIGO and Virgo community in association with
several partners. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the methods used to
promptly identify and localize GW event candidates and to request images of
targeted sky locations.
  Methods. During two observing periods (Dec 17 2009 to Jan 8 2010 and Sep 2 to
Oct 20 2010), a low-latency analysis pipeline was used to identify GW event
candidates and to reconstruct maps of possible sky locations. A catalog of
nearby galaxies and Milky Way globular clusters was used to select the most
promising sky positions to be imaged, and this directional information was
delivered to EM observatories with time lags of about thirty minutes. A Monte
Carlo simulation has been used to evaluate the low-latency GW pipeline's
ability to reconstruct source positions correctly.
  Results. For signals near the detection threshold, our low-latency algorithms
often localized simulated GW burst signals to tens of square degrees, while
neutron star/neutron star inspirals and neutron star/black hole inspirals were
localized to a few hundred square degrees. Localization precision improves for
moderately stronger signals. The correct sky location of signals well above
threshold and originating from nearby galaxies may be observed with ~50% or
better probability with a few pointings of wide-field telescopes.

straightforward applications to two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and to
the bimodal light propagation in nonlinear optics. In the former case, the two
components represent different hyperfine atomic states, while in the latter
setting they correspond to orthogonal polarizations of light. Conditions
guaranteeing the stability of flat continuous wave (CW) asymmetric bimodal
states are established, followed by the study of families of the corresponding
DW patterns. Approximate analytical solutions for the DWs are found near the
point of the symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the CW states. An exact DW
solution is produced for ratio 3:1 of the XPM and SPM coefficients. The DWs
between flat asymmetric states, which are mirror images to each other, are
completely stable, and all other species of the DWs, with zero crossings in one
or two components, are fully unstable. Interactions between two DWs are
considered too, and an effective potential accounting for the attraction
between them is derived analytically. Direct simulations demonstrate merger and
annihilation of the interacting DWs. The analysis is extended for the system
including single- and double-peak external potentials. Generic solutions for
trapped DWs are obtained in a numerical form, and their stability is
investigated. An exact stable solution is found for the DW trapped by a
single-peak potential. In the 2D geometry, stable two-component vortices are
found, with topological charges s=1,2,3. Radial oscillations of annular
DW-shaped pulsons, with s=0,1,2, are studied too. A linear relation between the

discuss the results in terms of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) model

in the recombination due to the high electron density in Group B. In the
present study, the 3.3 um band provides crucial information on the size

ordered two-dimensional system we propose an approach that allows to solve the
BdG equations on much larger clusters than it is usually possible for
inhomogeneous systems. Applying this approach we demonstrate that the presence
of incommensurate spin density waves induces real-space inhomogeneity of the
superconducting order parameter even in the absence of external magnetic field.
In this case a homogeneous order parameter of the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-type superconducting state is slightly modulated, or
equivalently, a small fraction of the charge carriers form Cooper pairs with
non-zero total momentum. However, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is
applied, the homogeneous component of the order parameter is suppressed and the
system transits to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, where the
order parameter oscillates changing sign. We show that for s-wave pairing the
presence of external magnetic field diminishes the destructive influence of the
SDW order on superconductivity. A simple explanation of this effect is also
proposed.

case, the observation is a purely non-invasive discovery process; in the first
case, it is a purely invasive process, which can involve either creation or
destruction aspects. An entity can also be observed with or without a full
control over the observational process. In the latter case, the observation can
be described by a symmetry breaking mechanism, through which a specific
deterministic observational process is selected among a number of potential
ones, as explained in Aerts' hidden measurement approach. This is what is
called a product test, or product observation, whose consequences are that
outcomes can only be predicted in probabilistic terms, as it is the case in
typical quantum measurements. We also show that observations can be about
intrinsic (stable) properties of the observed entity, or about relational
(ephemeral) properties between the observer and observed entities; also, they
can be about intermediate properties, neither purely classical, nor purely
quantum. Our analysis allows us to propose a general conceptual
characterization of quantum measurements, as observational processes involving
three aspects: (1) product observations, (2) pure creation aspects and (3)
ephemeral relational properties. We also discuss the important concept of
non-spatiality and emphasize some of the differences and similarities between
quantum and classical/relativistic observations.

supply model. To the best of our knowledge the unit supply model has not been
studied yet.
  Our results for the unit supply model hold not only asymptotically, but for
all instances. This contrasts most of the previous work on \prob{Bin Covering}.
We prove that there is a combinatorial 5-approximation algorithm for GBC with
unit supply, which has running time $\bigO{nm\sqrt{m+n}}$. Furthermore, for
VSBC we show that the natural and fast Next Fit Decreasing ($\NFD$) algorithm
is a 9/4-approximation in the unit supply model. The bound is tight for the
algorithm and close to being best-possible. We show that there is an AFPTAS for
VSBC in the \emph{infinite} supply model.

prove that w.r.t. our model at least a small part of the system will remain

with certain counteractions in use, which only influence the individuals'

wound around a cylinder of odd circumference $L$. This 2J gap is really a
finite size effect that should not occur in the thermodynamic limit of the

wrap around the system if $L$ is large enough. In essence, the absence of 2J
excitations defines the ferromagnetic phase without recourse to calculating

environments subject to failures. We describe hypotheses on the dynamic
environment that allow random walks to meet the important property that the
token visits any node infinitely often. The randomness of this scheme allows it
to work on any topology, and require no adaptation after a topological change,
which is a desirable property for applications to dynamic systems. For random
walks to be a traversal scheme and to answer the concurrence problem, one needs
to guarantee that exactly one token circulates in the system. In the presence
of transient failures, configurations with multiple tokens or with no token can
occur. The meeting property of random walks solves the cases with multiple
tokens. The reloading wave mechanism we propose, together with timeouts, allows
to detect and solve cases with no token. This traversal scheme is
self-stabilizing, and universal, meaning that it needs no assumption on the
system topology. We describe conditions on the dynamicity (with a local
detection criterion) under which the algorithm is tolerant to dynamic
reconfigurations. We conclude by a study on the time between two visits of the
token to a node, which we use to tune the parameters of the reloading wave

study the velocity distribution of solar photospheric magnetic bright points.
The observations were obtained with the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar
Atmosphere instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope, while the numerical
simulations were undertaken with the MURaM code for average magnetic fields of
200 G and 400 G. We implemented an automated bright point detection and
tracking algorithm on the dataset, and studied the subsequent velocity
characteristics of over 6000 structures, finding an average velocity of
approximately 1 km/s, with maximum values of 7 km/s. Furthermore, merging
magnetic bright points were found to have considerably higher velocities, and
significantly longer lifetimes, than isolated structures. By implementing a new
and novel technique, we were able to estimate the background magnetic flux of
our observational data, which is consistent with a field strength of 400 G.

  2010)",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As proved recently in [PT], for varieties $X^{r+1}\subset \mathbb P^N$ such
that through $n\geq 2$ general points there passes an irreducible curve $C$ of
degree $\delta\geq n-1$ we have $N\leq \pi(r,n,\delta+r(n-1)+2)$, where
$\pi(r,n,d)$ is the Castelnuovo-Harris bound function for the geometric genus
of an irreducible non-degenerate variety $Y^r\subset\mathbb P^{n+r-1}$ of
degree $d$. A lot of examples of varieties as in the title and attaining the
previous bound for the embedding dimension are constructed from Castelnuovo
varieties and were thus dubbed {\it of Castelnuovo type} in [PT], where it is
also proved that all extremal varieties as above are of this kind, except
possibly when $n>2$, $r>1$ and $\delta=2n-3$.
  One of the main results of the paper is the classification of extremal
varieties $X^{r+1}\subset \mathbb P^{2r+3}$ 3-covered by twisted cubics and not
of Castelnuovo type. Interesting examples are provided by the so called {\it
twisted cubics over complex Jordan algebras of rank 3}, as pointed out by
Mukai. By relating to an extremal variety 3-covered by twisted cubics, via
tangential projection, a quadro-quadric Cremona transformation in $\mathbb P^r$
we are able to classify all these object either for $r\leq 4$ or under the
smoothness assumption. In the last case we obtain that they are either smooth
rational normal scrolls (hence of Castelnuovo type) or the Segre embeddings of
$\p^1\times Q^r$ or one of the four Lagrangian Grassmannians. We end by
discussing some open problems pointing towards the equivalence of these
apparently unrelated objects: extremal varieties 3-covered by twisted cubics,
quadro-quadric Cremona transformations of $\mathbb P^r$ and complex Jordan
algebras of dimension $r+1$ and of rank three.

is that the excitations generated by the initial perturbation presents

  Briefly, a `Lie 2-superalgebra' is a two-term chain complex with a bracket
like a Lie superalgebra, but satisfying the Jacobi identity only up to chain
homotopy. Simple examples of Lie 2-superalgebras arise from 3-cocycles on Lie
superalgebras, and it is in this way that we constructed the Lie 2-superalgebra

geometric technique applies, and we obtain a Lie 2-supergroup integrating the

high-energy limit, we show that the dipole formula implies Reggeization of

accuracy, for the exchange of arbitrary color representations in the cross
channel. We observe that the real part of the amplitude Reggeizes also at
next-to-leading logarithmic order, and we compute the singular part of the
two-loop Regge trajectory, which is universally expressed in terms of the cusp
anomalous dimension. Our approach provides tools to study the high-energy limit
beyond the boundaries of Regge factorization: thus we show that Reggeization
generically breaks down at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, and
provide a general expression for the leading Reggeization-breaking operator.
Our approach applies to multiparticle amplitudes in multi-Regge kinematics, and
it also implies new constraints on possible corrections to the dipole formula,

defined as the ratio of translation rate $\omega_{\rm tl}$ of protein from mRNA
to degradation rate $\omega_p$ of protein, is obtained. The key point to get
this ratio $r$ is to get the translation rate $\omega_{\rm tl}$. In the study
of Valleriani {\it et al}, $\omega_{\rm tl}$ is assumed to be the mean value of
measured translation rate, i.e. the mean value of ratio of the translation
number of protein to the lifetime of mRNA. However, in experiments different
methods might be used to get $\omega_{\rm tl}$. Therefore, for the sake of
future application of their model to more experimental data analysis, in this
comment three methods to get the translation rate $\omega_{\rm tl}$, and
consequently the translational ratio $r$, are provided. Based on one of the
methods which might be employed in most of the experiments, we find that the
translational ratio $r$ decays exponentially with the length of mRNA in
prokaryotic cells, and decays reciprocally with the length of mRNA in
eukaryotic cells. This result is slight different from that obtained in

spectroscopy of O-type stars, aiming at the analysis of Nitrogen abundances.
  We implemented a new Nitrogen model atom into the NLTE atmosphere/spectrum
synthesis code FASTWIND, and compare the resulting optical NIII lines at
4634/40/42 A with other predictions, mostly from Mihalas & Hummer (1973, ApJ
179, 827,`MH'), and from the alternative code CMFGEN.
  Using similar model atmospheres as MH (not blanketed and wind-free), we are
able to reproduce their results, in particular the triplet emission lines.
According to MH, these should be strongly related to dielectronic recombination
(DR) and the drain by certain two-electron transitions. However, using
realistic, fully line-blanketed atmospheres at solar abundances, the key role
of DR controlling these emission features is superseded -- for O-star
conditions -- by the strength of the stellar wind and metallicity. In the case
of wind-free models, the resulting lower ionizing EUV-fluxes severely suppress
the emission. As the mass-loss rate is increased, pumping through the NIII
resonance line(s) in the presence of a near-photospheric velocity field results
in a net optical triplet line emission. A comparison with results from CMFGEN
is mostly satisfactory, except for the range 30 kK < Teff < 35 kK, where CMFGEN
triggers the triplet emission at lower Teff than FASTWIND. This effect could be
traced down to line overlap effects between the NIII and OIII resonance lines
that so far cannot be simulated by FASTWIND.
  Since the efficiency of DR and `two electron drain' strongly depends on the
degree of line-blanketing/-blocking, we predict the emission to become stronger
in a metal-poor environment, though lower wind-strengths and Nitrogen
abundances might counteract this effect. Weak winded stars should display less
triplet emission than stars with `normal' winds.

performance.
  In particular, we show that in the public service advertising model, reaching
a small constant fraction of the agents is enough to bring the system to a
state within a log n factor of optimal in a broad class of set cover and set
packing games or a constant factor of optimal in the special cases of vertex
cover and maximum independent set, circumventing social inefficiency of bad
local equilibria that could arise without a central authority. We extend these
results to the learn-then-decide model, in which agents use any of a broad
class of learning algorithms to decide in a given round whether to behave
according to locally optimal behavior or the behavior prescribed by the
broadcast signal. The new techniques we use for analyzing these games could be
of broader interest for analyzing more general classic optimization problems in
a distributed fashion.

convergence is observed up to contact, i.e. about 3-4 cycles to merger; error
estimates can be made up to this point. The uncertainties on the phase and the
amplitude are dominated by truncation errors and can be minimized to 0.13 rad
and less then 1%, respectively, by using several simulations and extrapolating
in resolution. In the latter case finite-radius extraction uncertainties become
a source of error of the same order and have to be taken into account. The

uncertainties on the waveforms are such that accuracy standards are generically
not met for signal-to-noise ratios relevant for detection, except for some best

is thus imperative for the use of numerical relativity waveforms from binary

microscopic stochastic rules for the actions of individual cells and viruses.
The interaction among viruses and tumor cells involves cell infection,
intracellular virus replication and release of new viruses in the tissue after
cell lysis. The evolution in time of both viral load and cancer cell
population, as well as the probabilities for tumor eradication were evaluated
for a range of multiplicities of infection, viral entries and burst sizes. It
was found that in immunosuppressed hosts, the antitumor efficacy of a virus is
primarily determined by its entry efficiency, its replicative capacity within
the tumor, and its ability to spread over the tissue. However, the optimal
traits for oncolytic viruses depends critically on the tumor growth dynamics
and do not necessarily include rapid replication, cytolysis and spreading
currently assumed as necessary conditions to a successful therapeutic outcome.
Our findings have potential implications on the design of new vectors for the

unveil the unknown mass-loss mechanism, their chemical composition and stellar

more sophisticated opacity treatment done with 3D radiative- hydrodynamics
CO5BOLD. In the code, the coupled equations of compressible hydrodynamics and
non-local radiation transport are solved in the presence of a spherical
potential. The stellar core is replaced by a special spherical inner boundary
condition, where the gravitational potential is smoothed and the energy
production by fusion is mimicked by a simply producing heat corresponding to
the stellar luminosity. The post-processing radiative transfer code OPTIM3D is
used to extract spectroscopic and interferometric observables. We show that the
relaxation of the assumption of frequency-independent opacities shows a steeper
mean thermal gradient in the optical thin region that affect strongly the
atomic strengths and the spectral energy distribution. Moreover, the weaker
temperature fluctuations reduce the incertitude on the radius determination
with interferometry. We show that 1D models of red supergiants must include a
turbulent velocity calibrated on 3D simulations to obtain the effective surface
gravity that mimic the effect of turbulent pressure on the stellar atmosphere.

triggering such accretion bursts. We study the spatial and velocity structure
of envelopes around FUors by means of molecular line observations at mm
wavelengths. We target three prototypical FUors and an object possibly in a
pre-outburst state. We present archival PdBI interferometric observations of
the J=1-0 line of 13CO at 110.2 GHz. For three of our targets, these represent
the first mm interferometric observations. The data allow the study of the
molecular environment of the objects on a spatial resolution of a thousand AU
and a velocity resolution of 0.2 km/s. Strong, narrow 13CO(1-0) line emission
is detected from all sources. The emission is spatially resolved in all cases,
with deconvolved sizes of a few thousand AUs. For V1057 Cyg and V1331 Cyg, the
emitting area is rather compact, suggesting that the origin of emission is an
envelope surrounding the central star. For V1735 Cyg, the 13CO emission is
offset from the stellar position, indicating that the source of emission may be
a small foreground cloud, also responsible for the high reddening of the
central star. The 13CO emission towards V1515 Cyg is the most extended in the
sample, and coincides with the ring-like optical reflection nebula associated
with V1515 Cyg. We suggest that mm interferometric observations are
indispensable for a complete understanding of the circumstellar environment of
FUors. Any theory of the FUor phenomenon that interprets the geometry of the
circumstellar structure and its evolution using single beam measurements must
be checked and compared to interferometric observations in the future.

TeV spectrum extending to 10 TeV. Its unusual spectral characteristics make it
a frequently used probe for intergalactic radiation and magnetic fields. With
new, simultaneous observations in the optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-rays, the
synchrotron emission is probed in great detail. The X-ray emission varies by a
factor of ~2 in 2009, while being rather stable in 2010. The X-ray spectrum is
very hard (\Gamma ~ 1.8) and it shows an indication of excess absorption above
the Galactic value. The X-ray emission is detected up to ~100 keV without any
significant cut-off, thus 1ES 0229+200 belongs to the class of extreme blazars.
The simultaneous measured, host galaxy- and extinction-corrected optical and UV
fluxes illustrate that the cut-off of the low energy part of the synchrotron
emission is located in the UV regime. The minimum energy of the electron
distribution has to be rather high to account for this cut-off. This implies
that there is a narrow-band energy distribution function of radiating
electrons, which is responsible for the unusually hard TeV spectrum. Other
extreme blazars have similar synchrotron peak frequencies but much softer TeV
spectra, hence 1ES 0229+200 has one of the highest inverse Compton (IC) peak
frequency and the narrowest electron distribution among the extreme blazars
known to date.

identify patterns which have been predicted by model calculations as signatures
of the progenitor and accretion rate which change the explosion energy and the
amount of electron capture, respectively. Using these templates as principle
components and the overdetermined system of SN pairs, we reconstruct the
properties of progenitors and progenitor systems. All LCO SNe Ia follow the
brightness decline relation but 2001ay. After subtraction of the two
components, the remaining scatter is reduced to 0.01-0.03m. Type SNe Ia seem to
originate from progenitors with Main Sequence masses of 3Mo with the exception
of two subluminous SNe Ia with < 2Mo. The component analysis indicates a wide
range of accretion rates in the progenitor systems closing the gap to accretion
induced collapses (AIC). SN1991t-like objects show differences in $dm15$ but no
tracers of our secondary parameters. This may point to a different origin such
as DD-Scenario or the Pulsating Delayed Detonations. SN2001ay does not follow
the decline relation. It can be understood in the framework of C-rich WDs, and
this group may produce an anti-Phillips relation. We suggest that this may be a
result of a common envelope phase and mixing during central He burning as in
SN1987A.

mag(Z) in frequency ranges u,g,r there are characteristic features both similar
for all the curves and different for different curves. At Z<2 all the curves
have practically the same form with two characteristic sections of the negative
slope, at Z>2 the forms of the curves significantly differ. The nature of these
differences can be interpreted as an influence of Lyman-alpha absorption. Then
we analyze the dependencies on redshift of the magnitudes averaged over the sky
in the range r, free fromLyman-alpha absorption effect, for galaxies and
quasars and show that as for quasars and for galaxies the dependencies of
average magnitudes on Z have a nature of converging oscillations with areas of
negative slope, corresponding to increase of apparent luminosity with
increasing of the distance. We calculate the corresponding values of the
average absolute luminosities for the flat space and for different variants of
the LambdaCDM model. In all cases they increase with the growth of the
redshift. When the redshift increases from 0.02 to 2 then average radiation
power of galaxies increases by thousands times. Such changes appear to be
impossible which leads us to the assumption that these results are related to
the used calculation methods and the features of the metric tensor underlying
of the standard cosmological model. In the modified cosmological model which
built on the metrics obtained with the considering the non-zero value of the
differential of scale factor, appear features that are missing in the standard
model, including the effect of increase of the apparent luminosity with the
increase of distance. Calculation allows obtaining a curves close to
dependencies of average magnitudes on redshift issuing from observation data.

are indications that changes in direction of the lineaments are associated with
fracture zones, associated with Uranium mineralization processes. Most of the
bodies with magnetic contrasts are located at depths less than 500 meters, but
there also a number of bodies at depths extending up to depths of 1500m. The
results have also allowed determination of a number of structural features not

to robustly detect lines in images. However, since the votes do not take line
connectivity into account, these methods do not deal well with cluttered
images. In opposition, the so-called local methods enforce connectivity but
lack robustness to deal with challenging situations that occur in many
realistic scenarios, e.g., when line segments cross or when long segments are
corrupted. In this paper, we address the critical limitations of the HT as a
line segment extractor by incorporating connectivity in the voting process.
This is done by only accounting for the contributions of edge points lying in
increasingly larger neighborhoods and whose position and directional content
agree with potential line segments. As a result, our method, which we call
STRAIGHT (Segment exTRAction by connectivity-enforcInG HT), extracts the
longest connected segments in each location of the image, thus also integrating
into the HT voting process the usually separate step of individual segment
extraction. The usage of the Hough space mapping and a corresponding
hierarchical implementation make our approach computationally feasible. We
present experiments that illustrate, with synthetic and real images, how
STRAIGHT succeeds in extracting complete segments in several situations where
current methods fail.

the ""quantum convective motion"" that the magnetic field produces already in the

in a redefinition of the elastic displacement field $\uv$, such that the

current density of the ground-state and $\partial_t$ is the partial derivative

approximation"" analogous to the one proposed in the absence of magnetic field.
The resulting equation of motion for $\uv$ is expressed in terms of
ground-state properties -- the one-particle density matrix and the two-particle

high-energy heavy-ion collision, quarks are produced in two waves. The first is
during the first fm/c of the collision, when gluons thermalize into the QGP.
After a roughly isentropic expansion that roughly conserves the number of
quarks, a second wave ensues at hadronization, 5-10 fm/c into the collision.
Since each hadron contains at least two quarks, the majority of quark
production occurs at this later time. For each quark produced in a heavy-ion
collision, an anti-quark of the same flavor is created at the same point in
space-time. Charge balance functions identify, on a statistical basis, the
location of balancing charges for a given hadron, and given the picture above
one expects the distribution in relative rapidity of balancing charges to be
characterized by two scales. After first demonstrating how charge balance
functions can be created using any pair of hadronic states, it will be shown
how one can identify and study both processes of quark production. By
considering balance functions of several hadronic species, and by performing
illustrative calculations, this class of measurement appears to hold the

superfluid Fermi gas are analytically derived within the path-integral
formalism taking into account Gaussian fluctuations about the saddle point. The
spectra are obtained for nonzero temperatures, both with and without imbalance,
and for arbitrary interaction strength. On the basis of the pair excitation
spectrum, we have calculated the thermodynamic parameters of state of cold
fermions and the first and second sound velocities. The parameters of pair
excitations show a remarkable agreement with the Monte Carlo data and with
experiment.

  Sequences",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressive sensing (CS) has recently emerged as a framework for efficiently
capturing signals that are sparse or compressible in an appropriate basis.
While often motivated as an alternative to Nyquist-rate sampling, there remains
a gap between the discrete, finite-dimensional CS framework and the problem of
acquiring a continuous-time signal. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this
gap by exploiting the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's), a
collection of functions that trace back to the seminal work by Slepian, Landau,
and Pollack on the effects of time-limiting and bandlimiting operations. DPSS's
form a highly efficient basis for sampled bandlimited functions; by modulating
and merging DPSS bases, we obtain a dictionary that offers high-quality sparse
approximations for most sampled multiband signals. This multiband modulated
DPSS dictionary can be readily incorporated into the CS framework. We provide
theoretical guarantees and practical insight into the use of this dictionary
for recovery of sampled multiband signals from compressive measurements.

corners of academic interest such as physics, mathematics and computer science.
In this paper I have proposed a Bi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for community
detection which maximizes modularity and community score. Then the results
obtained for both benchmark and real life data sets are compared with other
algorithms using the modularity and MNI performance metrics. The results show
that the BOCD algorithm is capable of successfully detecting community
structure in both real life and synthetic datasets, as well as improving upon
the performance of previous techniques.

  Satisfaction Problems","A4, 11pt, 9 pages. This is an extended abstract",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We give a unified treatment to optimization problems that can be expressed in
the form of nonnegative-real-weighted Boolean constraint satisfaction problems.
Creignou, Khanna, Sudan, Trevisan, and Williamson studied the complexity of
approximating their optimal solutions whose optimality is measured by the sums
of outcomes of constraints. To explore a wider range of optimization constraint
satisfaction problems, following an early work of Marchetti-Spaccamela and
Romano, we study the case where the optimality is measured by products of
constraints' outcomes. We completely classify those problems into three
categories: PO problems, NPO-hard problems, and intermediate problems that lie
between the former two categories. To prove this trichotomy theorem, we analyze
characteristics of nonnegative-real-weighted constraints using a variant of the
notion of T-constructibility developed earlier for complex-weighted counting
constraint satisfaction problems.

addressed in the framework of a quantitative description approach. In this
paper we propose to interpret the shape of things as a physical manifestation
of the content of information associated with each thing and show that a change
of shape in a physical system is necessarily connected with a change of its
entropy and thus involves energy. We estimate the amount of energy dissipated
during a shape change and propose experimental tests to be performed in
nanoscale systems, to verify this prediction by measuring the expected
dissipation in few simple cases.

into two new nodal points due to the coherent scattering among vacancies. The

band of zero energy due to particle-hole symmetry is found. Our theory offers
an excellent explanation to the recent experiments.
