relative-state consensus protocols with an adaptive law for adjusting the
coupling weights between neighboring agents are designed for both the linear
and nonlinear cases, under which consensus is reached for all undirected
connected communication graphs. Extensions to the case with a leader-follower
communication graph are further studied. In contrast to the existing results in
the literature, the adaptive consensus protocols here can be implemented by
each agent in a fully distributed fashion without using any global information.

Column densities from these observations as well as previous HCO$^{+}(4

H$^{13}$CN$(4 \rightarrow 3)$, and CS$(7 \rightarrow 6)$ data, have been
derived using the RADEX code, results later used to derived chemical abundances
at selected points in the MM1 main axis. Comparing with chemical models, we
estimate an evolutionary age of $10^{4}$ years for a remarkable warm hot core
inside MM1. We also proposed that the dust temperature derived from SED fitting
in MM1 is not representative of the gas temperature deep inside the clump as
dust emission may have become optically thick. By deriving a deuterium
fractionation of $1.2 \times 10^{3}$, we estimate an electron fraction of
$X(e)= 6.5 \times 10^{-8}$. Thus, the coupling between the neutral gas and the
magnetic field is estimated by computing the ambipolar diffusion Reynolds
number $R_{m}=18$ and the wave coupling number W=110. Considering that the
infalling speed is slightly supersonic (M=1.1) but sub-alfvenic, we conclude
that the MM1 clump has recently or is in the process of decoupling the field
from the neutral fluid. Thus, the MM1 clump appears to be in an intermediate
stage of evolution in which a hot core has developed while the envelope is
still infalling and not fully decoupled from the ambient magnetic field.

family of layered materials possessing a hexagonal lattice. While graphite has
non-polar homo-nuclear C-C intra-layer bonds, h-BN presents highly polar B-N
bonds resulting in different optimal stacking modes of the two materials in
bulk form. Furthermore, the static polarizabilities of the constituent atoms
considerably differ from each other suggesting large differences in the
dispersive component of the interlayer bonding. Despite these major differences
both materials present practically identical interlayer distances. To
understand this finding, a comparative study of the nature of the interlayer
bonding in both materials is presented. A full lattice sum of the interactions
between the partially charged atomic centers in h-BN results in vanishingly
small monopolar electrostatic contributions to the interlayer binding energy.
Higher order electrostatic multipoles, exchange, and short-range correlation
contributions are found to be very similar in both materials and to almost
completely cancel out by the Pauli repulsions at physically relevant interlayer
distances resulting in a marginal effective contribution to the interlayer
binding. Further analysis of the dispersive energy term reveals that despite
the large differences in the individual atomic polarizabilities the
hetero-atomic B-N C6 coefficient is very similar to the homo-atomic C-C
coefficient in the hexagonal bulk form resulting in very similar dispersive
contribution to the interlayer binding. The overall binding energy curves of
both materials are thus very similar predicting practically the same interlayer
distance and very similar binding energies.

about their nature.
  In this paper the reliability of supermassive Bose-Einstein condensates
(henceforth SMBECs) as alternative to supermassive black holes is examined.
Such condensates are found to suffer of a causality problem that terminates
their cosmological growth toward acquiring masses typical for quasars and
triggers their self-collapse into supermassive black holes (SMBHs).
  It is argued that a SMBEC-core most likely would be subject to an extensive
deceleration of its rotational frequency as well as to vortex-dissipation
induced by the magnetic fields that thread the crust, hence diminishing the
superfluidity of the core. Given that rotating superfluids between two
concentric spheres have been verified to be dynamically unstable to non
axi-symmetric perturbations, we conclude that the remnant energy stored in the
core would be sufficiently large to turn the flow turbulent and dissipative and
subsequently lead to core collapse bosonova.
  The feasibility of a conversion mechanism of normal matter into bosonic
condensates under normal astrophysical conditions is discussed as well.
  We finally conclude that in lack of a profound theory for quantum gravity,
BHs should continue to be the favorite proposal for BH candidates.

law to explain the colors of blackbodies, including the Sun and other stars, in
terms of their temperatures. We argue here that focusing on the peak of the
blackbody spectrum is misleading for three reasons. First, the Planck curve is
too broad for an individual spectral color to stand out. Second, the location
of the peak of the Planck curve depends on the choice of the independent
variable in the plot. And third, Wien's displacement law is seldom used in
actual practice to find a temperature and direct fitting to the Planck function
is preferable. We discuss these flaws and argue that, at the introductory
level, presentation of blackbody radiation in terms of photon statistics would
be more effective pedagogically. The average energy of the emitted photons
would then be presented in place of Wien's displacement law, and discussion of
the Stefan-Boltzmann law would include the total number of photons emitted per
second. Finally, we suggest that the Planck spectrum is most appropriately
plotted as a ""spectral energy density per fractional bandwidth distribution,""
using a logarithmic scale for the wavelength or frequency.

a feature which both decreases computational cost as well as stabilizes the

in several applications. Through a Bayesian variable selection example, the
authors demonstrate the convergence gains obtained with interacting chains. The
ability of the algorithm's adaptive proposal to induce mode-jumping is
illustrated through a trimodal density and a Bayesian mixture modeling

significant. Using realistic estimates for the strongly coupled quark--gluon

capacity provisioning in data centers to reduce energy wastage due to the
variation in workload. This paper explores the opportunity for cost saving
utilizing the flexibility from the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and proposes
a novel approach for capacity provisioning under bounded latency requirements
of the workload. We investigate how many servers to be kept active and how much
workload to be delayed for energy saving while meeting every deadline. We
present an offline LP formulation for capacity provisioning by dynamic deferral
and give two online algorithms to determine the capacity of the data center and
the assignment of workload to servers dynamically. We prove the feasibility of
the online algorithms and show that their worst case performance are bounded by
a constant factor with respect to the offline formulation. We validate our
algorithms on a MapReduce workload by provisioning capacity on a Hadoop cluster
and show that the algorithms actually perform much better in practice compared
to the naive `follow the workload' provisioning, resulting in 20-40%
cost-savings.

challenges to the operation of the electric power grid. Conventional generators
can be used to mitigate this variability but are costly to operate and produce
carbon emissions. Energy storage provides a more environmentally friendly
alternative, but is costly to deploy in large amounts. This paper studies the
limits on the benefits of energy storage to renewable energy: How effective is
storage at mitigating the adverse effects of renewable energy variability? How
much storage is needed? What are the optimal control policies for operating
storage? To provide answers to these questions, we first formulate the power
flow in a single-bus power system with storage as an infinite horizon
stochastic program. We find the optimal policies for arbitrary net renewable
generation process when the cost function is the average conventional
generation (environmental cost) and when it is the average loss of load
probability (reliability cost). We obtain more refined results by considering
the multi-timescale operation of the power system. We view the power flow in
each timescale as the superposition of a predicted (deterministic) component
and an prediction error (residual) component and formulate the residual power
flow problem as an infinite horizon dynamic program. Assuming that the net
generation prediction error is an IID process, we quantify the asymptotic
benefits of storage. With the additional assumption of Laplace distributed
prediction error, we obtain closed form expressions for the stationary
distribution of storage and conventional generation. Finally, we propose a
two-threshold policy that trades off conventional generation saving with loss
of load probability. We illustrate our results and corroborate the IID and
Laplace assumptions numerically using datasets from CAISO and NREL.

measures the degree of criticality; the system changes from one critical state

find these two constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously in any realistic

Cosmicflows-1. The Wiener Filter method is used to recover the full 3D peculiar
velocity field from the observed map of radial velocities and to recover the
underlying linear density field. The velocity field within a data zone of 3000
km/s is decomposed into a local component that is generated within the data
zone and a tidal one that is generated by the mass distribution outside that
zone. The tidal component is characterized by a coherent flow toward the
Norma-Hydra-Centaurus (Great Attractor) region while the local component is
dominated by a flow toward the Virgo Cluster and away from the Local Void. A
detailed analysis shows that the local flow is predominantly governed by the
Local Void and the Virgo Cluster plays a lesser role. The analysis procedure
was tested against a mock catalog. It is demonstrated that the Wiener Filter
accurately recovers the input velocity field of the mock catalog on the scale
of the extraction of distances and reasonably recovers the velocity field on
significantly larger scales. The Bayesian Wiener Filter reconstruction is
carried out within the ?CDM WMAP5 framework. The Wiener Filter reconstruction
draws particular attention to the importance of voids in proximity to our
neighborhood. The prominent structure of the Local Supercluster is wrapped in a
horseshoe collar of under density with the Local Void as a major component.

densities in numerical simulations. Knowing the column density in any direction
at any location in space is a prerequisite for modelling the propagation of
radiation through the computational domain. TreeCol therefore forms the basis
for a fast, approximate method for modelling the attenuation of radiation
within large numerical simulations. It constructs a HEALPix sphere at any
desired location and accumulates the column density by walking the tree and by
adding up the contributions from all tree nodes whose line of sight contributes
to the pixel under consideration. In particular when combined with widely-used
tree-based gravity solvers the new scheme requires little additional
computational cost. In a simulation with $N$ resolution elements, the
computational cost of TreeCol scales as $N \log N$, instead of the $N^{5/3}$
scaling of most other radiative transfer schemes. TreeCol is naturally
adaptable to arbitrary density distributions and is easy to implement and to
parallelize. We discuss its accuracy and performance characteristics for the
examples of a spherical protostellar core and for the turbulent interstellar
medium. We find that the column density estimates provided by TreeCol are on
average accurate to better than 10 percent. In another application, we compute
the dust temperatures for solar neighborhood conditions and compare with the
result of a full-fledged Monte Carlo radiation-transfer calculation. We find
that both methods give very similar answers. We conclude that TreeCol provides
a fast, easy to use, and sufficiently accurate method of calculating column
densities that comes with little additional computational cost when combined
with an existing tree-based gravity solver.

the class of two-dimensional convolutional codes (2D CCs) and 2D tail-biting
convolutional codes (2D TBCCs), in particular, from several aspects. First, we
derive several basic algebraic properties of these codes, applying algebraic
methods in order to find bijective encoders, create parity check matrices and
to inverse encoders. Next, we discuss the minimum distance and weight
distribution properties of these codes. Extending an existing tree-search
algorithm to two dimensions, we apply it to find codes with high minimum

compared with other codes. The results of this approach suggest that 2D TBCCs
can perform better than comparable 1D TBCCs or other codes. We then present
several novel iterative suboptimal algorithms for soft decoding 2D CCs, which
are based on belief propagation. Two main approaches to decoding are
considered. We first focus on a decoder which extends the concept of trellis
decoding to two dimensions. Second, we investigate algorithms which use the
code's parity check matrices. We apply conventional BP in the parity domain,
but improve it with a novel modification. Next, we test the generalized belief
propagation (GBP) algorithm. Performance results are presented and compared
with optimum decoding techniques and bounds. The results show that our
suboptimal algorithms achieve respectable results, in some cases coming as
close as 0.2dB from optimal (maximum-likelihood) decoding. However for some of
the codes there is still a large gap from the optimal decoder.

like for linear polymers, depending on the relative length of the chain
compared with the channel. For long chains with length $N$ larger than the
critical chain length $N_{c}$, at which the chain just fully occupies the
nanochannel, the ejection for ring polymers is faster compared with linear
chains of identical length due to a larger entropic pulling force; while for
short chains ($N<N_c$), it takes longer time for ring polymers to eject out of
the channel due to a longer distance to be diffused to reach the exit of the
channel before experiencing the entropic pulling force. These results can help

dynamics of the plasma consisting of compressible electrons and a uniform ion
background. By using the dispersive Klein-Gordon effect, Guo \cite{Guo98} first
constructed a global smooth irrotational solution in the three dimensional
case. It has been conjectured that same results should hold in the
two-dimensional case. The main difficulty in 2D comes from the slow dispersion
of the linear flow and certain nonlocal resonant obstructions in the
nonlinearity.
  In this paper we develop a new method to overcome these difficulties and
construct smooth global solutions for the 2D Euler-Poisson system.

applications of recent interest, ranging from photonic bandgap (PBG) structures
and plasmonically active nanostructures to metamaterials. To achieve an
accurate representation of the fields in these structures using numerical
methods, dense spatial discretization is required. This, in turn, affects the
cost of analysis, particularly for integral equation based methods, for which
traditional iterative methods require O(N^2) operations, N being the number of
spatial degrees of freedom. In this paper, we introduce a method for the rapid
solution of volumetric electric field integral equations used in the analysis
of doubly periodic dielectric structures. The crux of our method is the ACE
algorithm, which is used to evaluate the requisite potentials in O(N) cost.
Results are provided that corroborate our claims of acceleration without
compromising accuracy, as well as the application of our method to a number of
compelling photonics applications.

principles that allow the (pyramidal) neuron to act as a ""combinatorial
switch"". Namely, the neuron learns to be more prone to generate spikes given
those combinations of firing input neurons for which a previous spiking of the
neuron had been followed by a positive global reward signal. The reward signal
may be mediated by certain modulatory hormones or neurotransmitters, e.g., the
dopamine. More generally, a trial-and-error learning paradigm is suggested in
which a global reward signal triggers long-term enhancement or weakening of a
neuron's spiking response to the preceding neuronal input firing pattern. Thus,
rewards provide a feedback pathway that informs neurons whether their spiking
was beneficial or detrimental for a particular input combination. The neuron's
ability to discern specific combinations of firing input neurons is achieved
through a random or predetermined spatial distribution of input synapses on
dendrites that creates synaptic clusters that represent various permutations of
input neurons. The corresponding dendritic segments, or the enclosed individual
spines, are capable of being particularly excited, due to local sigmoidal
thresholding involving voltage-gated channel conductances, if the segment's
excitatory and absence of inhibitory inputs are temporally coincident. Such
nonlinear excitation corresponds to a particular firing combination of input
neurons, and it is posited that the excitation strength encodes the
combinatorial memory and is regulated by long-term plasticity mechanisms. It is
also suggested that the spine calcium influx that may result from the
spatiotemporal synaptic input coincidence may cause the spine head actin
filaments to undergo mechanical (muscle-like) contraction, with the ensuing
cytoskeletal deformation transmitted to the axon initial segment where it
