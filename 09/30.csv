  2011. To appear in the Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are a ubiquitous feature of
locally-observed galaxies, and ample evidence suggests that the growth of SMBHs
and their host galaxies is closely linked. However, in the event of a merger,
gravitational-wave (GW) recoil may displace a SMBH from its galactic center, or
eject it entirely. To explore the consequences of this phenomenon, we use
hydrodynamic simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers that include a range of BH
recoil velocities. We have generated a suite of over 200 simulations with more
than 60 merger models, enabling us to identify systematic trends in the
behavior of recoiling BHs -- specifically (i) their dynamics, (ii) their
observable signatures, and (iii) their effects on BH/galaxy co-evolution. (i)
Recoiling BH trajectories depend heavily on the gas content of the host galaxy;
maximal BH displacements from the center may vary by up to an order of
magnitude between gas-rich and gas-poor mergers. In some cases, recoil
trajectories also depend on the timing of the BH merger relative to the
formation of the galaxy merger remnant. (ii) Recoiling BHs may be observable as
offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) via either kinematic offsets (v > 800 km
s^-1) or spatial offsets (R > 1 kpc) for lifetimes of about 1 - 100 Myr. In
addition, recoil events affect the total AGN lifetime. GW recoil generally
reduces the lifetimes of bright AGN, but may extend lower-luminosity AGN
lifetimes. (iii) Rapidly-recoiling BHs may be up to about 5 times less massive
than their stationary counterparts. These mass deficits lower the normalization
of the M - sigma relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter.
Furthermore, recoil events displace AGN feedback from the galactic center,
which enhances central star formation rates. This results in longer starburst
phases and higher central stellar densities in merger remnants.

Thomas has proven very useful in modeling few-body systems. For three particles

separability, whereby symmetries and conservation laws that hold for a system
of particles also hold for isolated subsystems. Cluster separability can be
restored by means of a recursive construction using unitary transformations,
but implementation is difficult in practice, and the quantitative extent to
which the Bakamjian-Thomas approach violates cluster separability has never
been tested. This paper provides such a test by means of a model of a scalar
probe in a three-particle system for which (1) it is simple enough that there
is a straightforward solution that satisfies Poincar\'e invariance and cluster
separability, and (2) one can also apply the Bakamjian-Thomas approach. The
difference between these calculations provides a measure of the size of the
corrections from the Sokolov construction that are needed to restore cluster

effect calculations of observables.

the regularized potential leads to regular scalar field and metric
perturbations of the initial configuration. The well-known conformal mappings
make these results also applicable to scalar-tensor and f(R) theories of

spectra is achieved along the linear chain approximation via 1D-cluster version
of the phenomenological Percolation scheme, originally developed for zincblende
alloys, after ab initio calibration of the intrinsic Si-Si, Ge-Ge and Si-Ge
Raman efficiencies. The 1D-cluster scheme introduces a seven-oscillator
[1x(Ge-Ge), 4x(Si-Ge), 2x(Si-Si)] Raman behavior for SiGe, which considerably
deviates from the currently admitted six-oscillator [1x(Ge-Ge), 1x(Si-Ge),
4x(Si-Si)] one. The 1D-cluster re-assignment of Raman lines is based on
remarkable intensity-interplays with composition, known from the literature,
but so far not properly understood. It is independently supported by ab initio
calculation of the frequencies of bond-stretching modes along prototype
impurity motifs taken as quasi-linear. Different numbers of Raman modes per
bond indicate different sensitivities to the local environment of the Ge-Ge
(insensitive), Si-Si (sensitive to 1st neighbors) and Si-Ge (sensitive to 2nd
neighbors) bond-stretchings. Last, we compare the SiGe Percolation scheme with
the current version for zincblende alloys, using GaAsP as a natural reference.
The SiGe vs. GaAsP comparison is supported by ab initio calculation of local
lattice relaxation/dynamics related to prototype impurity motifs that are
directly transposable to the two crystal structures.

the important case of a planar slit geometry. The computational complexity of
the algorithm scales as O(N) or $O(N\log N$), where $N$ is proportional to the
product of number of particles and the number of elements employed to
discretize the particle. This technique is enabled by the use of an alternative
boundary integral formulation in which the velocity field is expressed in terms
of a single layer integral alone, even in problems with non-matched
viscosities. The density of the single layer integral is obtained from a
Fredholm integral equation of the second kind involving the double layer
integral. Acceleration in this implementation is provided by the use of General
Geometry Ewald-like method (GGEM) for computing the velocity and stress fields
driven by a set of point forces in the geometry of interest. For the particular
case of the slit geometry, a Fourier-Chebyshev spectral discretization of GGEM
is developed. Efficient implementations employing the GGEM methodology are
presented for the resulting single and the double layer integrals. The
implementation is validated with test problems on the velocity of rigid

deformation parameter of capsules in simple shear flow and the particle
trajectory in pair collisions of capsules in shear flow. The computational
complexity of the algorithm is verified with results from several large scale

mechanically active environments are quite different than the conditions that
apply to our local interstellar neighborhood. In such galactic environments, a
variety of feedback processes can play a significant role in shaping the
initial mass function (IMF). Here, we present a numerical study on the effects
of an accreting black hole and the influence of nearby massive stars to a
collapsing, 800 M_sun, molecular cloud at 10 pc distance from the black hole.
We parametrize and study radiative feedback effects of hard X-rays emanating
from the black hole broad line region, increased cosmic ray rates due to
supernovae in starbursts, and strong UV radiation produced by nearby massive
stars. We also investigate the importance of shear from the supermassive,
10^6-10^8 M_sun, black hole as the star-forming cloud orbits around it. We find
that thermal pressure from X-rays compresses the cloud, which induces a high
star formation rate early on, but reduces the overall star formation efficiency
to about 7% due to gas depletion by evaporation. We see that the turn-over mass
of the IMF increases up to a factor of 2.3, M_turn = 1-1.5 M_sun, for the model
with the highest X-ray flux (160 erg s^-1 cm^-2), while the high-mass slope of
the IMF becomes Gamma > -1. This results in more high mass stars and a
non-Salpeter IMF. Cosmic rays penetrate deeply into the cloud and increase the
gas temperature (50-200 K), which leads to a reduced formation efficiency of
low mass stars. High cosmic ray rates increase the average mass of stars,
thereby shifting the turn-over mass to higher values, i.e., up to several solar
masses. Due to this process, the onset of star formation is also delayed. We
conclude that the IMF inside active galaxies is different than the one obtained
from local environments.

for pre-launch calibrations of CDS and EIS. During the 2007 flight, EUNIS, SOHO
CDS and Hinode EIS observed the same solar locations, allowing the EUNIS
calibrations to be directly applied to both CDS and EIS. The measured CDS NIS 1
line intensities calibrated with the standard (version 4) responsivities with
the standard long-term corrections are found to be too low by a factor of 1.5
due to the decrease in responsivity. The EIS calibration update is performed in
two ways. One is using the direct calibration transfer of the calibrated
EUNIS-07 short wavelength (SW) channel. The other is using the insensitive line
pairs, in which one member was observed by EUNIS-07 long wavelength (LW)
channel and the other by EIS in either LW or SW waveband. Measurements from
both methods are in good agreement, and confirm (within the measurement
uncertainties) the EIS responsivity measured directly before the instrument's
launch. The measurements also suggest that the EIS responsivity decreased by a
factor of about 1.2 after the first year of operation. The shape of the EIS SW
response curve obtained by EUNIS-07 is consistent with the one measured in
laboratory prior to launch. The absolute value of the quiet-Sun He II 304 A
intensity measured by EUNIS-07 is consistent with the radiance measured by CDS
NIS in quiet regions near the disk center and the solar minimum irradiance
obtained by CDS NIS and SDO/EVE recently.

suspensions containing a binary mixture of Neo-Hookean capsules subjected to
pressure driven flow in a planar slit. The two components of the binary mixture
have unequal membrane rigidities. The problem is studied numerically using an
accelerated implementation of the boundary integral method. The effect of a
variety of parameters was investigated, including the capillary number,
rigidity ratio between the two species, volume fraction, confinement ratio, and
the number fraction of the more floppy particle $X_f$ in the mixture. It was
observed that in suspensions of pure species, the mean wall normal positions of
the stiff and the floppy particles are comparable. In mixtures, however, the
stiff particles were found to be increasingly displaced towards the walls with
increasing $X_f$, while the floppy particles were found to increasingly
accumulate near the centerline with decreasing $X_f$. The origins of this
segregation is traced to the effect of the number fraction $X_f$ on the
localization of the stiff and the floppy particles in the near wall region --
the probability of escape of a stiff particle from the near wall region to the
interior is greatly reduced with increasing $X_f$, while the exact opposite
trend is observed for a floppy particle with decreasing $X_f$. Simple model
studies on heterogeneous pair collisions involving a stiff and a floppy
particle mechanistically explain this observation. The key result in these
studies is that the stiff particle experiences much larger cross-stream
displacement in heterogeneous collisions than the floppy particle. A unified
mechanism incorporating the wall-induced migration of deformable particles and
the particle fluxes associated with heterogeneous and homogeneous pair
collisions is presented.

calculated upper limits on the bolometric luminosities of the progenitors
assuming black-body X-ray spectra with temperatures of 30-150 eV. This is
inspired by the fact that luminous super-soft X-ray sources have been suggested
as the direct progenitors of type Ia supernovae. The upper limits of two
supernovae in our sample are comparable to the luminosities of the brightest
observed super-soft sources, ruling out such sources as the progenitors of
these supernovae. In contrast to Liu et al (2012) we find that for SN2011fe we
can rule out Eddington luminosity systems for black body temperatures as low as
40 eV. Our findings are consistent with statistical studies comparing the
observed type Ia supernova rate to the number of super-soft sources or the
integrated X-ray luminosity in external galaxies. This suggest that either the
progenitors of type Ia supernovae are not accreting, nuclear burning white
dwarfs, or that they do not look like the classical super-soft sources, e.g.
because they are obscured.

that ${\operatorname{tr}}R_{v}$, ${\operatorname{tr}}R_{v}^{2}$ are invariant

Ledger conditions are obtained and they are used to give applications to
Iwasawa type spaces. In the class of D'Atri spaces of Iwasawa type, we show two
different characterizations of the symmetric spaces of noncompact type: they
are exactly the $\frak{C}$-spaces and on the other hand they are $k$ -D'Atri
spaces for some $k\geq 3.$ In the last case, they are $k$-D'Atri for all

small geodesic spheres). Moreover, applying this result in the case of 4%

(TFF) of the eta and eta' mesons at Q^2=112 GeV^2, combined with new
measurements of the their spacelike TFFs and those of the pi0 and eta_c mesons,
provide powerful tests of QCD and models of the distribution amplitudes of
quarks inside these mesons. The eta_c TFF shows the expected behavior over the
Q^2 range 1-50 GeV^2, and we are sensitive to next-to-leading-order QCD
corrections. The eta and eta' TFFs are consistent with expected behavior, but
those for the pi0 are not. Extracting the strange and nonstrange components of
the eta and eta' TFFs, we find the nonstrange component to be consistent with
theoretical expectations and inconsistent with the measured pi0 TFF.

constant problem. The scenario is based on two postulates for inflationary
theory: one is that inflaton $\phi$ can interact with radiation (relativistic
particles); the other is that radiation will be created continuously during and
after the epoch of inflation. According to these postulates and from a
""macroscopic perspective"", we discover that radiation can be viewed as a
product of the interaction between $\dot{\phi}$ and some ""effective kinetic
frictional force"" that exists in inflaton dynamics. Deducing and surmising from
""effective friction"", we obtain conclusions of two special types of expanding
universe: A Type I universe will finally enter an expanding course after a
special time $t_{*}$ with uniformly rolling $\dot{\phi}(t_{*})$ due to the
balance between $V^{'}(\phi(t))$, 3H(t)\dot{\phi}(t_{*}) and the ""effective
kinetic frictional force"". In this result, the expanding course will see
particles created continuously. Additionally, for a Type II universe, $\phi$
will be at rest after $t_{r}$ inside a region named the ""stagnant zone"" that is
formed by the ""maximum effective static frictional force"". Consistent with
this, inflaton potential will survive as a relic $V(\phi(t_{r}))$, playing the
role of the effective cosmological constant $\Lambda$ .

spacetimes is the existence of universal bounds on the energy density and the
expansion and shear scalars, independent of the matter content. We investigate
the properties of these physical quantities in Bianchi-II and Bianchi-IX
spacetimes, which have been recently loop quantized using the connection
operator approach. Using the effective Hamiltonian approach, we show that for
Bianchi-II spacetime, energy density and the expansion and shear scalars turn
out to be bounded, albeit not by universal values. In Bianchi-IX spacetime,
when the approach to the classical singularity is isotropic, above physical
quantities are bounded. In addition, for all other cases, where the approach to
singularities is not isotropic and effective dynamics can be trusted, these
quantities turn out to be finite. These results stand in sharp distinction to
general relativity, where above physical quantities are generically unbounded,
leading to the break down of geodesic equations. In contrast to the isotropic
and Bianchi-I models, we find the role of energy conditions for Bianchi-II
model and the inverse triad modifications for Bianchi-IX to be significant to
obtain above bounds. These results bring out subtle physical distinctions
between the quantization using holonomies over closed loops performed for
isotropic and Bianchi-I models, and the connection operator approach. We find
that qualitative differences in physics exist for these quantization methods
even for the isotropic models in the presence of spatial curvature. We
highlight these important differences in the behavior of the expansion scalar
in the holonomy based quantization and connection operator approach for
isotropic spatially closed and open models.

untangled from the underlying Gabor-like filters. There is so much redundancy
in sparse codes for natural images that our model requires only a single
dictionary element (a Gabor-like edge detector) to outperform standard sparse

much greater statistical efficiency during learning. We validate this claim

An order-to-order phase transition is identified by fidelity susceptibility in
the two-dimensional Heisenberg XXZ model with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction
on a square lattice. The finite size scaling of fidelity susceptibility shows a
power-law divergence at criticality, which indicates the quantum phase
transition is of second order. Two distinct types of quantum phase transitions
are witnessed by fidelity susceptibility in Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a
hexagonal lattice. We exploit the symmetry of two-dimensional quantum compass
model, and obtain a simple analytic expression of reduced fidelity
susceptibility. Compared with the derivative of ground-state energy, the
fidelity susceptibility is a bit more sensitive to phase transition. The
violation of power-law behavior for the scaling of reduced fidelity
susceptibility at criticality suggests that the quantum phase transition
belongs to a first-order transition. We conclude that fidelity susceptibility
and reduced fidelity susceptibility show great advantage to characterize
diverse quantum phase transitions in spin-orbit models.

usually not with self-oscillation, a property of certain dynamical systems that
gives rise to a great variety of vibrations, both useful and destructive. In a
self-oscillator, the driving force is controlled by the oscillation itself so
that it acts in phase with the velocity, causing a negative damping that feeds
energy into the vibration: no external rate needs to be adjusted to the
resonant frequency. The famous collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge in 1940,
often attributed by introductory physics texts to forced resonance, was
actually a self-oscillation, as was the swaying of the London Millennium
Footbridge in 2000. Clocks are self-oscillators, as are bowed and wind musical
instruments. The heart is a ""relaxation oscillator,"" i.e., a non-sinusoidal
self-oscillator whose period is determined by sudden, nonlinear switching at
thresholds. We review the general criterion that determines whether a linear
system can self-oscillate. We then describe the limiting cycles of the simplest
nonlinear self-oscillators, as well as the ability of two or more coupled
self-oscillators to become spontaneously synchronized (""entrained""). We
characterize the operation of motors as self-oscillation and prove a theorem
about their limit efficiency, of which Carnot's theorem for heat engines

servomechanisms, Cepheid variable stars, lasers, and the macroeconomic business

finding a concise description of the network in terms of its modules. This
notion has been recently exploited by the Map equation formalism (M. Rosvall
and C.T. Bergstrom, PNAS, 105(4), pp.1118--1123, 2008) through an
information-theoretic description of the process of coding inter- and
intra-community transitions of a random walker in the network at stationarity.
However, a thorough study of the relationship between the full Markov dynamics
and the coding mechanism is still lacking. We show here that the original Map
coding scheme, which is both block-averaged and one-step, neglects the internal
structure of the communities and introduces an upper scale, the `field-of-view'
limit, in the communities it can detect. As a consequence, Map is well tuned to
detect clique-like communities but can lead to undesirable overpartitioning
when communities are far from clique-like. We show that a signature of this
behavior is a large compression gap: the Map description length is far from its
ideal limit. To address this issue, we propose a simple dynamic approach that
introduces time explicitly into the Map coding through the analysis of the
weighted adjacency matrix of the time-dependent multistep transition matrix of
the Markov process. The resulting Markov time sweeping induces a dynamical
zooming across scales that can reveal (potentially multiscale) community
structure above the field-of-view limit, with the relevant partitions indicated
by a small compression gap.

Reference Model (HMRM) of the memory trace, showing how miss minimization can
be naturally formulated in the optimal control setting. In addition to the
traditional version assuming a buffer of fixed capacity, a relaxed version is
also considered, in which buffer occupancy can vary and its average is
constrained. Resorting to multiobjective optimization, viewing occupancy as a
cost rather than as a constraint, the optimal eviction policy is obtained by
composing solutions for the individual addressable items.
  This approach is then specialized to the Least Recently Used Stack Model
(LRUSM), a type of HMRM often considered for traces, which includes V-1
parameters, where V is the size of the virtual space. A gain optimal policy for
any target average occupancy is obtained which (i) is computable in time O(V)
from the model parameters, (ii) is optimal also for the fixed capacity case,
and (iii) is characterized in terms of priorities, with the name of Least
Profit Rate (LPR) policy. An O(log C) upper bound (being C the buffer capacity)
is derived for the ratio between the expected miss rate of LPR and that of OPT,
the optimal off-line policy; the upper bound is tightened to O(1), under
reasonable constraints on the LRUSM parameters. Using the stack-distance
framework, an algorithm is developed to compute the number of misses incurred
by LPR on a given input trace, simultaneously for all buffer capacities, in
time O(log V) per access.
  Finally, some results are provided for miss minimization over a finite
horizon and over an infinite horizon under bias optimality, a criterion more
stringent than gain optimality.

given set of bands (e.g. g and r), but show that it is the result of the flux
contribution from less-variable or delayed emission lines in the different SDSS
bands at different redshifts. After correcting for this effect, quasar
color-variability is remarkably uniform, and independent not only of redshift,
but also of quasar luminosity and black hole mass. The color variations of
individual quasars, as they vary in brightness on year timescales, are much
more pronounced than the ranges in color seen in samples of quasars across many
orders of magnitude in luminosity. This indicates distinct physical mechanisms
behind quasar variability and the observed range of quasar luminosities at a
given black hole mass - quasar variations cannot be explained by changes in the
mean accretion rate. We do find some dependence of the color variability on the
characteristics of the flux variations themselves, with fast, low-amplitude,
brightness variations producing more color variability. The observed behavior
could arise if quasar variability results from flares or ephemeral hot spots in
an accretion disc.

scatter in observables that result from spherically averaging clusters
described by ellipsoidal generalizations of the NFW profile or a nearly
scale-free logarithmic potential. Although the mean biases are small and mostly
<1%, the flattest cluster models generally have a significant mean bias; i.e.,
averaging over all orientations does not always eliminate projection biases.
Substantial biases can result from different viewing orientations, where the
integrated Compton-y parameter (Y_SZ) and the concentration have the largest
scatter (as large as sigma ~10% for Y_SZ), and the emission-weighted
temperature (T_X) has the smallest (sigma < ~0.5%). The very small scatter for
T_X leads to Y_X and M_gas having virtually the same orientation biases.
Substantial scatter is expected for individual clusters (up to sigma ~8%) in
the correlation between Y_SZ and Y_X in comparison to the small mean bias
(sigma < ~1%) applicable to a random sample of clusters of sufficient size. For
ellipsoidal NFW models we show that the orientation bias for the total cluster
mass attains a minimum near the radius r_2500 so that the spherically averaged
mass computed at this radius is always within ~0.5% of the true value for any
orientation. Finally, to facilitate the accounting for orientation bias in
X-ray and SZ cluster studies, we provide cubic polynomial approximations to the
mean orientation bias and 1-sigma scatter for each cluster observable as a
function of axial ratio for the ellipsoidal NFW models.

some of the free parameters, e.g. the characteristic scales for quenching star
formation in both high-mass and low-mass halos, are already tightly constrained
by the single data set. The posterior distribution includes the model
parameters adopted in other SAMs. By marginalising over the posterior
distribution, we make predictions that include the full inferential
uncertainties for the colour-magnitude relation, the Tully-Fisher relation, the
conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in halos of different masses, the
HI mass function, the redshift evolution of the stellar mass function of
galaxies, and the global star formation history. Using posterior predictive
checking with the available observational results, we find that the model
family (i) predicts a Tully-Fisher relation that is curved; (ii) significantly

Methods. Atmospheric parameters and photospheric abundances have been
determined using the non-LTE atmosphere code tlusty. Effective temperature
estimates were deduced using three different methodologies depending on the
spectral features observed; in general they were found to yield consistent
estimates. Gravities were deduced from Balmer line profiles and
microturbulences from the Si iii spectrum. Additionally the contributions of
continuum emission from circumstellar discs were estimated. Given its
importance in constraining stellar evolutionary models, nitrogen abundances (or
upper limits) were deduced for all the stars analysed. Results. Our nitrogen
abundances are inconsistent with those predicted for targets spending most of
their main sequence life rotating near to the critical velocity. This is
consistent with the results we obtain from modelling the inferred rotational
velocity distribution of our sample and of other investigators. We consider a
number of possibilities to explain the nitrogen abundances and rotational
velocities of our Be-type sample.

braking currently limits our understanding of close binary evolution. Because
of their intrinsically simple structure, observational population studies of
white dwarf plus main sequence (WDMS) binaries hold the potential to test
theoretical models and constrain their parameters. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) has provided a large and homogeneously selected sample of WDMS binaries,
which we are characterising in terms of orbital and stellar parameters. We have
obtained radial velocity information for 385 WDMS binaries from follow-up
spectroscopy, and for an additional 861 systems from the SDSS sub-spectra.
Radial velocity variations identify 191 of these WDMS binaries as post common
envelope binaries (PCEBs). Orbital periods of 58 PCEBs were subsequently
measured, predominantly from time-resolved spectroscopy, bringing the total
number of SDSS PCEBs with orbital parameters to 79. Observational biases
inherent to this PCEB sample were evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo
simulations. We find that 21-24% of all SDSS WDMS binaries have undergone
common envelope evolution, which is in good agreement with published binary
population models and high-resolution HST imaging of WDMS binaries unresolved
from the ground. The bias corrected orbital period distribution of PCEBs ranges
from 1.9 h to 4.3 d and follows approximately a normal distribution in
log(Porb), peaking at ~10.3 h. There is no observational evidence for a
significant population of PCEBs with periods in the range of days to weeks. The
large and homogeneous sample of SDSS WDMS binaries provides the means to test
fundamental predictions of binary population models, and hence to
observationally constrain the evolution of all close compact binaries.

  ""Vending Machine""","33 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory (1st revision)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Source coding with a side information ""vending machine"" is a recently
proposed framework in which the statistical relationship between the side
information and the source, instead of being given and fixed as in the
classical Wyner-Ziv problem, can be controlled by the decoder. This control
action is selected by the decoder based on the message encoded by the source
node. Unlike conventional settings, the message can thus carry not only
information about the source to be reproduced at the decoder, but also control
information aimed at improving the quality of the side information. In this
paper, the analysis of the trade-offs between rate, distortion and cost
associated with the control actions is extended from the previously studied
point-to-point set-up to two basic multiterminal models. First, a distributed
source coding model is studied, in which two encoders communicate over
rate-limited links to a decoder, whose side information can be controlled. The
control actions are selected by the decoder based on the messages encoded by
both source nodes. For this set-up, inner bounds are derived on the
rate-distortion-cost region for both cases in which the side information is
available causally and non-causally at the decoder. These bounds are shown to
be tight under specific assumptions, including the scenario in which the
sequence observed by one of the nodes is a function of the source observed by
the other and the side information is available causally at the decoder. Then,
a cascade scenario in which three nodes are connected in a cascade and the last
node has controllable side information, is also investigated. For this model,
the rate-distortion-cost region is derived for general distortion requirements
and under the assumption of causal availability of side information at the last
node.

energy excitation of graphene. The model is based on a deformation of the
Heisenberg algebra which makes the commutator of momenta proportional to the
pseudo-spin. We solve the Landau problem for the resulting Hamiltonian which
reduces, in the large mass limit while keeping fixed the Fermi velocity, to the
usual linear one employed to describe these excitations as massless Dirac
fermions. This model, extended to negative mass, allows to reproduce the
leading terms in the low energy expansion of the dispersion relation for both
nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions. Taking into account the
contributions of both Dirac points, the resulting Hall conductivity, evaluated
with a $\zeta$-function approach, is consistent with the anomalous integer
quantum Hall effect found in graphene. Moreover, when considered in first order
perturbation theory, it is shown that the next-to-leading term in the
interaction between nearest neighbor produces no modifications in the spectrum
of the model while an electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field
produces just a rigid shift of this spectrum.

will modify the neutrino spectrum greatly. The atmospheric neutrino spectrum
measured by IceCube can constrain the LIV parameter to the level of $10^{-12}$.
The future detection of astrophysical neutrinos of Galactic sources is expected
to be able to give even stronger constraint on the LIV parameter of neutrinos.

flows on the standard D2Q9 lattice is developed in the framework of the
double-distribution-function (DDF) approach in which the viscous heat
dissipation and compression work are considered. In the model, a density
distribution function is used to simulate the flow field, while a total energy
distribution function is employed to simulate the temperature field. The
discrete equilibrium density and total energy distribution functions are
obtained from the Hermite expansions of the corresponding continuous
equilibrium distribution functions. The pressure given by the equation of state
of perfect gases is recovered in the macroscopic momentum and energy equations.
The coupling between the momentum and energy transports makes the model
applicable for general thermal flows such as non-Boussinesq flows, while the
existing DDF LB models on standard lattices are usually limited to Boussinesq
flows in which the temperature variation is small. Meanwhile, the simple
structure and basic advantages of the DDF LB approach are retained. The model
is tested by numerical simulations of thermal Couette flow, attenuation-driven
acoustic streaming, and natural convection in a square cavity with small and
large temperature differences. The numerical results are found to be in good

significant diversity in the molecular emission from the inner few AU of T
Tauri disks. We explore theoretically the possible origin of this diversity by
expanding on our earlier thermal-chemical model of disk atmospheres. We
consider how variations in grain settling, X-ray irradiation, accretion-related
mechanical heating, and the oxygen-to-carbon ratio can affect the thermal and
chemical properties of the atmosphere at 0.25-40 AU. We find that these model
parameters can account for many properties of the detected molecular emission.
The column density of the warm (200-2000K) molecular atmosphere is sensitive to
grain settling and the efficiency of accretion-related heating, which may
account, at least in part, for the large range in molecular emission fluxes
that have been observed. The dependence of the atmospheric properties on the
model parameters may also help to explain trends that have been reported in the
literature between molecular emission strength and mid-infrared color, stellar
accretion rate, and disk mass. We discuss whether some of the differences
between our model results and the observations (e.g., for water) indicate a
role for vertical transport and freeze-out in the disk midplane. We also
discuss how planetesimal formation in the outer disk (beyond the snowline) may
imprint a chemical signature on the inner few AU of the disk and speculate on
possible observational tracers of this process.

than a spectrum with the same intensity localized in a single channel. We are
interested in broadband pulses and use the modulation index to excise

threshold above which candidate events are removed. The technique is tested
both with simulations and using data from sources of known radio pulses (RRAT

effective at eliminating not only narrowband RFI but also spurious signals from
bright, real pulses that are dedispersed at incorrect dispersion measures. The
method is generalized to coherent dedispersion, image cubes, and astrophysical

function of approximately 430,000 massive luminous red galaxies(LRGs) observed
at relatively low spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR ~3-5 per 69 km
s^(-1)) by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). We marginalize over spectroscopic redshift
errors, and use the full velocity-dispersion likelihood function for each
galaxy to make a self-consistent determination of the velocity-dispersion
distribution parameters as a function of absolute magnitude and redshift,
correcting as well for the effects of broadband magnitude errors on our
binning. Parameterizing the distribution at each point in the
luminosity-redshift plane with a log-normal form, we detect significant
evolution in the width of the distribution toward higher intrinsic scatter at
higher redshifts. Using a subset of deep re-observations of BOSS galaxies, we
demonstrate that our distribution-parameter estimates are unbiased regardless
of spectroscopic SNR. We also show through simulation that our method
introduces no systematic parameter bias with redshift. We highlight the
advantage of the hierarchical Bayesian method over frequentist ""stacking"" of
spectra, and illustrate how our measured distribution parameters can be adopted
as informative priors for velocity-dispersion measurements from individual
noisy spectra.

temperature of dense plasmas in compact astrophysical objects, particulary
white dwarfs and neutron stars. Typically ions in these systems are modeled
classically, but Daligault et al. use a semiclassical inter-ion potential. We
run molecular dynamic simulations using this semiclassical approach in order to
calculate the diffusion coefficient and melting temperatures in a one component
plasma. We find that in liquid simulations quantum corrections do not have a
significant effect on diffusion, increasing it by only a factor of two from our
classical simulation. However, in solid simulations, diffusion slowly increases
for small quantum corrections, but once quantum effects become large enough,
the system can liquify. We also find that quantum corrections can decrease the
melting temperature of a one component plasma, potentially affecting the way in
which white dwarfs cool. These results suggest that a helium white dwarf may
remain liquid at typical white dwarf densities, while the structure of a
neutron star's crust could be altered due to quantum effects.

determined most precisely from the mean life of the positive muon, tau_mu.
Advances in theory have reduced the theoretical uncertainty on G_F as
calculated from tau_mu to a few tenths of a part per million (ppm). Until
recently, the remaining uncertainty on G_F was entirely experimental and
dominated by the uncertainty on tau_mu. We report the MuLan collaboration's
recent 1.0 ppm measurement of the positive muon lifetime. This measurement is
over a factor of 15 more precise than any previous measurement, and is the most
precise particle lifetime ever measured. The experiment used a time-structured
low-energy muon beam and an array of plastic scintillators read-out by waveform
digitizers and a fast data acquisition system to record over 2 times 10^{12}
muon decays. Two different in-vacuum muon-stopping targets were used in
separate data-taking periods. The results from these two data-taking periods
are in excellent agreement. The combined results give
tau_{mu^+}({MuLan})=2196980.3(2.2) ps. This measurement of the muon lifetime
gives the most precise value for the Fermi Constant: G_F({MuLan}) = 1.1663788
(7) \times 10^{-5} {GeV}^{-2} (0.6 ppm). The lifetime is also used to extract
the mu^-p singlet capture rate, which determines the proton's weak induced

range of astronomical observations, including broadband NIR photometry and
high-resolution NIR spectroscopy. Using a line-by-line radiative transfer
approach, we calculate theoretical transmission spectra in the deep red optical
(700 to 1050 nm) for Apache Point Observatory. In this region the spectrum is
dominated by H2O, which is known to be highly variable in concentration on
short timescales. We fit our telluric models to high-resolution observations of
A stars and estimate the relative optical depth of H2O absorption under a wide
range of observing conditions. We compare these optical depth estimates to
simultaneous measurements of Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) based on data from
a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver located at Apache Point. We find
that measured PWV correlates strongly with the scaling of H2O absorption lines
in our spectra, indicating that GPS-based PWV measurements combined with
atmospheric models may be a powerful tool for the real-time estimation of total
molecular absorption in broad NIR bands. Using photometric measurements from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR8 database we demonstrate that PWV biases
the calibrated r-z colors and z-band fluxes of mid-M stars but not mid-G stars.
While this effect is small compared to other sources of noise in the SDSS
z-band observations, future surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
aim for higher precision and will need to take time-variable molecular
transmission into account for the global calibration of NIR measurements of
objects having strong spectral features at these wavelengths. Empirical
calibrations based on PWV may be immediately applicable to ongoing efforts to
make mmag differential measurements of M stars to detect transiting exoplanets.

is employed to balance resonant signal enhancement against non-resonant

the background can be achieved by shaping the probe pulse alone while keeping
the pump and Stokes pulses in transform-limited-form (TLF). In some cases
analytical forms for the probe pulse can be found, and numerical simulations
are carried out for other circumstances. It is found that a good approximate
solution for the optimal pulse in the two-pulse CARS is a superposition of

process of non-linear mode conversion. In order to understand the physics of
coronal heating and solar wind acceleration together, it is important to
consider the regions from photosphere to interplanetary space as a single
system. We performed 2.5 dimensional, self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic

first time. We carefully set up the grid points with spherical coordinate to
treat the Alfv\'{e}n waves in the atmosphere with huge density contrast, and
successfully simulate the solar wind streaming out from the hot solar corona as
a result of the surface convective motion. The footpoint motion excites
Alfv\'{e}n waves along an open magnetic flux tube, and these waves traveling
upwards in the non-uniform medium undergo wave reflection, nonlinear mode
conversion from Alfv\'{e}n mode to slow mode, and turbulent cascade. These
processes leads to the dissipation of Alfv\'{e}n waves and acceleration of the
solar wind. It is found that the shock heating by the dissipation of the slow
mode wave plays a fundamental role in the coronal heating process whereas the
turbulent cascade and shock heating drive the solar wind.

evaluation of the Green's function for the Helmholtz equation subject to
impedance boundary conditions on a half-space. The two principal approaches
used for representing this Green's function are the Sommerfeld integral and the
(closely related) method of complex images. The former is extremely efficient
when the source is at some distance from the half-space boundary, but involves
an unwieldy range of integration as the source gets closer and closer. Complex
image-based methods, on the other hand, can be quite efficient when the source
is close to the boundary, but they do not easily permit the use of the
superposition principle since the selection of complex image locations depends
on both the source and the target. We have developed a new, hybrid
representation which uses a finite number of real images (dependent only on the
source location) coupled with a rapidly converging Sommerfeld-like integral.
While our method applies in both two and three dimensions, we restrict the
detailed analysis and numerical experiments here to the two-dimensional case.

(INS) experiments of SrMn3P4O14 powders. We observed plural magnetic
excitations. The peak positions are 0.46, 0.68, and 1.02 meV. Constant-Q-scan
spectra at several Q values (magnitude of the scattering vector) indicate that
the dispersion is weak. The weak dispersion indicates that the excitations are
transitions between discrete energy levels. Our INS results are consistent with
results expected in the trimer model. We evaluated the J1 value as 0.29 meV
(3.4 K) without considering the other interactions.

  I want to discuss the stellar activity and its impact on the discovery of
extrasolar planets. Up to now the discovery of small rocky planets called
""Super-Earths"" like CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b are the only exceptions. The
question arises, why among over 500 detected and verified planets the amount of
smaller planets is strikingly low. An explanation besides that the verification
of small planets is an intriguing task, is the high level of stellar activity
that has been observed.
  Stellar activity can be observed at different time-scales from long term
irradiance variations similar to the well known solar cycle, over stellar
rotation in the regime of days, down to the observations of acoustic modes in
the domain of minutes. But also non periodic events like flares or the activity
signal of the granulation can prevent the detection of a transiting Earth sized
planet.
  I will describe methods to detect transit-like signals in stellar photometric
data, the influences introduced by the star, the observer and their impact on
the success. Finally different mathematical models and approximations of
transit signals will be examined on their sensibility of stellar activity.
  I present a statistical overview of stellar activity in the CoRoT dataset.
The influence of stellar activity will be analysed on different transiting
planets: CoRoT-2b, CoRoT-4b und CoRoT-6b.
  Stellar activity can prevent the successful detection of a transiting planet,
where CoRoT-7b marks the borderline. Future missions like Plato will be
required to provide long-term observations with mmag precision to overcome the
limitations set by active stars in our Galactic neighbourhood.

related to the question of what it means for a theory to describe the same
physics on different spacetimes. In this paper, we consider in detail the
example of the free minimally coupled Klein--Gordon field, both as a classical
and quantum theory (using both the Weyl algebra and a smeared field approach).
It is shown that the massive theory obeys dynamical locality, both classically
and in quantum field theory, in all spacetime dimensions $n\ge 2$ and allowing
for spacetimes with finitely many connected components. In contrast, the
massless theory is shown to violate dynamical locality in any spacetime
dimension, in both classical and quantum theory, owing to a rigid gauge
symmetry. Taking this into account (equivalently, working with the massless
current) dynamical locality is restored in all dimensions $n\ge 2$ on connected
spacetimes, and in all dimensions $n\ge 3$ if disconnected spacetimes are
permitted. The results on the quantized theories are obtained using general
results giving conditions under which dynamically local classical symplectic

these flares originate, nor exactly how the X-rays are emitted. The power-law
electrons radiating the infrared light may be partially cooled, so the
distribution may be a broken power law with a (""cooling break"") transition
frequency. In addition, the emission region appears to be rather compact,
possibly restricted to the inner edge of the accretion disk. In that case, the
X-ray outburst may itself be due to synchrotron processes by the most energetic
particles in this population. In this paper, we examine several key features of
this proposal, producing relativistically correct polarimetric images of Sgr
A*'s NIR and X-ray flare emission, in order to determine (1) whether the
measured NIR polarization fraction is consistent with this geometry, and (2)
whether the predicted X-ray to NIR peak fluxes are confirmed by the currently
available multi-wavelength observations. We also calculate the X-ray
polarization fraction and position angle (relative to that of the NIR photons)
in anticipation of such measurements in the coming years. We show that whereas
the polarization fraction and position angle of the X-rays are similar to those
of the NIR component for synchrotron-cooled emission, these quantities are
measurably different when the X-rays emerge from a scattering medium. It is
clear, therefore, that the development of X-ray polarimetry will represent a

first step in SLALOM creation was factoring out common concepts, by composing
the BPMN metamodel with that of the SLA life cycle, as described in ITIL. The
derived metamodel expresses the SLALOM abstract syntax model. The second step
was to write concrete syntaxes targeting different aims, such as SLA

external driving has two major effects on the TLS. The first is increased
fluctuations between the two states of the TLS, the significance of this effect
compared to thermal fluctuations depend on the energy splitting of the TLS
compared to temperature. The second effect is a reduction in the intensity of
the noise spectrum at low frequencies, and at the same time an increase in
intensity around the renormalized Rabi frequency of the TLS, the driving
frequency and at beatings between these two frequencies. Finally we study the
ensemble averaged noise spectrum for a typical distribution of TLSs known to
give origin to $\propto 1/f$ noise. We find that strong driving leads to
reduced noise at low frequencies, and therefore to an increased dephasing time
$T_2^Q$ of the qubit. However this effect is exponentially suppressed when the
driving frequency is large compared to temperature, as we typically find for
Josephson qubits. We suggest that external driving at frequencies much lower

the R\'enyi min information theory. We show that there is a close relation
between differential privacy and leakage, due to the graph symmetries induced
by the adjacency relation. Furthermore, we consider the utility of the
randomized answer, which measures its expected degree of accuracy. We focus on
certain kinds of utility functions called ""binary"", which have a close
correspondence with the R\'enyi min mutual information. Again, it turns out
that there can be a tight correspondence between differential privacy and
utility, depending on the symmetries induced by the adjacency relation and by
the query. Depending on these symmetries we can also build an optimal-utility
randomization mechanism while preserving the required level of differential
privacy. Our main contribution is a study of the kind of structures that can be
induced by the adjacency relation and the query, and how to use them to derive
bounds on the leakage and achieve the optimal utility.

Recent observations of LMC Cepheids bring new constraints on the
slope of the period-projection factor relation (hereafter Pp relation) that is
currently used in the Baade-Wesselink (hereafter BW) method of distance
determination. The discrepancy between observations and theoretical analysis is
particularly significant for short period Cepheids Aims. We investigate three
physical effects that might possibly explain this discrepancy: (1) the
spectroscopic S/N that is systematically lower for LMC Cepheids (around 10)
compared to Galactic ones (up to 300), (2) the impact of the metallicity on the
dynamical structure of LMC Cepheids, and (3) the combination of infrared
photometry/interferometry with optical spectroscopy. Methods. To study the S/N
we use a very simple toy model of Cepheids. The impact of metallicity on the
projection factor is based on the hydrodynamical model of delta Cep already
described in previous studies. This model is also used to derive the position
of the optical versus infrared photospheric layers. Results. We find no
significant effect of S/N, metallicity, and optical-versus-infrared
observations on the Pp relation. Conclusions. The Pp relation of Cepheids in
the LMC does not differ from the Galactic relation. This allows its universal
application to determine distances to extragalactic Cepheids via BW analysis.

structures, plasmonics aiming at manipulating light beyond the diffraction
limit has aroused great interest. Here, nevertheless, we demonstrate in
short-pulse laser ablation ultrafast active plasmonic structures spontaneously
generate in virtue of plasmonic effects rather than human ingenuity. First, the
splitting of laser-induced subwavelength gratings that is experimentally
evidenced on ZnO, Si, and GaAs, is confirmed to originate in the conversion of
SP modes from the resonant to the nonresonant mode and further to the inphase
or antiphase asymmetric mode. Further, as pulse number increases the universal
scaling-down of laser-induced structures is derived from the conversion of
physical regimes of plasmonic interaction from the optical to the electrostatic
regime, which may arouse quasistatic SPs with interacting scales far beyond the
diffraction limit and result in the ultrafast, non-thermal ablation for
extraordinary electrostatic enhancement. Generally, the plasmonic mechanisms
reveal the link between the deep-subwavelength space-scale and the ultra-short
timescale for ultrafast laser-induced nanostructures: basically, ""nanoscale""
tends to eliminate electromagnetic retardation effects and bring an instant
respond to the incident field, and arouse electrostatic interactions with giant
local-field enhancement facilitating ultrafast ablation driven by tremendous
electrostatic forces. Thus, active plasmonic structures provided with
simultaneous ""nanoscale"" and ""ultrafast"" is apt to form in ultrafast ablation.
In addition, the plasmonic mechanisms can act as a powerful ""evolutionary
force"" acting in multipulse ablation and promoting the growth of resonant
nanostructures-various typical plasmonic structures may be self-generated
through multipulse evolution, which can be considered as a kind of natural
plasmonics.

momentum $\vec L$ (defined by an inertial tensor) and the magnetization $\vec

and the inertial properties of ferromagnetic bodies. However, inertia is absent
from the dynamics of a magnetic dipole (the Landau-Lifshitz equation, the
Gilbert equation and the Bloch equation contain only the first derivative of
the magnetization with respect to time). In order to investigate this
paradoxical situation, the lagrangian approach (proposed originally by T. H.
Gilbert) is revisited keeping an arbitrary nonzero inertial tensor. A dynamic
equation generalized to the inertial regime is obtained. It is shown how both
the usual gyromagnetic relation and the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert

We further add another mass parameter m in a manner to respect two of the eight

on which the two supercharges are exactly preserved. The flat directions of
scalar fields are stabilized due to the mass deformations, which gives discrete
minima representing fuzzy spheres. We show in the perturbation theory that the
lattice continuum limit can be taken without any fine tuning. Around the
trivial minimum, this lattice theory serves as a non-perturbative definition of
two-dimensional N=(4,4) SYM theory. We also discuss that the same lattice

like applications in data networks. In this paper, we concentrate on NUM-based
rate allocation for streaming applications with the so-called S-curve utility
functions. Due to non-concavity of such utility functions, the underlying NUM
problem would be non-convex for which dual methods might become quite useless.
To tackle the non-convex problem, using elementary techniques we make the
utility of the network concave, however this results in reverse-convex
constraints which make the problem non-convex. To deal with such a transformed
NUM, we leverage Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach to approximate
the non-convex problem by a series of convex ones. Based on this approach, we
propose a distributed rate allocation algorithm and demonstrate that under mild
conditions, it converges to a locally optimal solution of the original NUM.
Numerical results validate the effectiveness, in terms of tractable convergence
of the proposed rate allocation algorithm.

extend the classical Cole-Hopf solution. This notion provides a factorisation
of the Cole-Hopf solution map into a ""universal"" measurable map from the
probability space into an explicitly described auxiliary metric space, composed
with a new solution map that has very good continuity properties. The advantage
of such a formulation is that it essentially provides a pathwise notion of a
solution, together with a very detailed approximation theory. In particular,
our construction completely bypasses the Cole-Hopf transform, thus laying the
groundwork for proving that the KPZ equation describes the fluctuations of
systems in the KPZ universality class.
  As a corollary of our construction, we obtain very detailed new regularity
results about the solution, as well as its derivative with respect to the
initial condition. Other byproducts of the proof include an explicit
approximation to the stationary solution of the KPZ equation, a well-posedness
result for the Fokker-Planck equation associated to a particle diffusing in a
rough space-time dependent potential, and a new periodic homogenisation result
for the heat equation with a space-time periodic potential. One ingredient in
our construction is an example of a non-Gaussian rough path such that the area
process of its natural approximations needs to be renormalised by a diverging
term for the approximations to converge.

Theorem7 states that there exist no two proper rationals both of whose sum and

morphological information contained in the residual images of galaxies after
the subtraction of a Sersic model. The removal of the bulk signal from the host
galaxy light is done with the aim of detecting the fainter minor mergers. The
specific morphological parameters that are used in the merger diagnostic
suggested here are the Residual Flux Fraction and the asymmetry of the
residuals. The new diagnostic has been calibrated and optimized so that the
resulting merger sample is very complete. However, the contamination by
non-mergers is also high. If the same optimization method is adopted for
combinations of other structural parameters such as the CAS system, the merger
indicator we introduce yields merger samples of equal or higher statistical
quality than the samples obtained through the use of other structural
parameters. We explore the ability of the method presented here to select minor
mergers by identifying a sample of visually classified mergers that would not
have been picked up by the use of the CAS system, when using its usual limits.
Given the low prevalence of mergers among the general population of galaxies
and the optimization used here, we find that the merger diagnostic introduced
in this work is best used as a negative merger test, i.e., it is very effective
at selecting non-merging galaxies. As with all the currently available
automatic methods, the sample of merger candidates selected is contaminated by

compared to antitop-quark production, denoted charge asymmetry, has been
observed at the Tevatron. The experimental results seem to exceed the theory
predictions based on the Standard Model by a significant amount and have
triggered a large number of suggestions for ""new physics"". In the present paper
the Standard Model predictions for Tevatron and LHC experiments are revisited.
This includes a reanalysis of electromagnetic as well as weak corrections,
leading to a shift of the asymmetry by roughly a factor 1.1 when compared to
the results of the first papers on this subject. The impact of cuts on the
transverse momentum of the top-antitop system is studied. Restricting the ttbar
system to a transverse momentum less than 20 GeV leads to an enhancement of the
asymmetries by factors between 1.3 and 1.5, indicating the importance of an
improved understanding of the $t\bar t$-momentum distribution. Predictions for
similar measurements at the LHC are presented, demonstrating the sensitivity of
the large rapidity region both to the Standard Model contribution and effects
from ""new physics"".

as well as discontinuities present in other massive theories proposed in the

revisited with a particular care on the related conservation laws.\ It will be
shown that a multiplicative factor is missing in the graviton tensor originally
derived by Visser, which has no incidence on the weak field approach but
becomes important in the strong field regime when, for instance, cosmological
applications are considered. In this case, contrary to some previous claims

measurements use data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34 pb^-1.
The b-jets are identified using either a lifetime-based method, where secondary
decay vertices of b-hadrons in jets are reconstructed using information from
the tracking detectors, or a muon-based method where the presence of a muon is
used to identify semileptonic decays of b-hadrons inside jets. The inclusive

and the angular variable chi in two dijet mass regions. The results are

objects have finite spatial extension, so the flow along them differs slightly.
The corresponding drag forces produce a finite average stretching and the
thread is stretched most of the time. Nevertheless, the probability of
shrinking fluctuations is significant and is known to decay only as a
power-law. We show that the exponent of the power law is a universal number
independent of the statistics of the flow. For polymers the coil-stretch
transition exists: the flow must have a sufficiently large Lyapunov exponent to
overcome the elastic resistance and stretch the polymer from the coiled state
it takes otherwise. The probability of shrinking from the stretched state above
the transition again obeys a power law but with a non-universal exponent. We
show that well above the transition the exponent becomes universal and derive
the corresponding expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate synchronization: the
end-to-end distances of threads or polymers above the transition are
synchronized by the flow and become identical. Thus, the transition from
Newtonian to non-Newtonian behavior in dilute polymer solutions can be seen as
an ordering transition.

to improve resource utilization and achieve an optimized solution with respect
to fuel comsumption of aircrafts, efficient usage of the available airspace
with minimal congestion related losses under various dynamic constraints. So
the focus has almost always been more on smarter management of traffic to
increase profits while human safety, though achieved in the process, we
believe, has remained less seriously attended. This has become all the more
important given that we have overburdened and overstressed air traffic
controllers managing hundreds of airports and thousands of aircrafts per day.
  We propose a multiagent system based distributed approach to handle air
traffic ensuring complete human (passenger) safety without removing any humans
(ground controllers) from the loop thereby also retaining the earlier
advantages in the new solution. The detailed design of the agent system, which
will be easily interfacable with the existing environment, is described. Based
on our initial findings from simulations, we strongly believe the system to be
capable of handling the nuances involved, to be extendable and customizable at

mounted with RF camera which provides continuous feedback of the environment.
The received visual information is then analyzed by user for appropriate

representing its semantics as a logical form and computing the answer given a
structured database of facts. The core part of such a system is the semantic
parser that maps questions to logical forms. Semantic parsers are typically
trained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms,
but this type of annotation is expensive.
  Our goal is to learn a semantic parser from question-answer pairs instead,
where the logical form is modeled as a latent variable. Motivated by this
challenging learning problem, we develop a new semantic formalism,
dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which has favorable linguistic,
statistical, and computational properties. We define a log-linear distribution
over DCS logical forms and estimate the parameters using a simple procedure
that alternates between beam search and numerical optimization. On two standard
semantic parsing benchmarks, our system outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art systems, despite using no annotated logical forms.

computational biology to finance to social networks. In the area of network
security, a node that becomes a hub of high correlation with neighboring nodes
might signal anomalous activity such as a coordinated flooding attack. In the
area of computational biology the set of hubs of a gene expression correlation
graph can serve as potential targets for drug treatment to block a pathway or
modulate host response. In the area of finance a hub might indicate a
vulnerable financial instrument or sector whose collapse might have major
repercussions on the market. In the area of social networks a hub of observed

techniques and theory presented in this paper permit scalable and reliable
screening for such hubs. This paper extends our previous work on correlation
screening [arXiv:1102.1204] to the more challenging problem of partial
correlation screening for variables with a high degree of connectivity. In

and an F-star companion of mass = 1.59 +/- 0.07 Msun that is somewhat beyond
its terminal-age main sequence. The orbital period is quite short at 2.69802

fluxes from the Galex images of this object; an estimate of the spectral type

near the detector, but which explore the same physics as the high-energy
neutrino beams from Long Baseline experiments. As the DAR spectrum is fixed,
the baseline is varied: plans call for 3 accelerator-based neutrino sources at
1.5, 8 and 20 km with staggered beam-on times. Compact, cost-effective
superconducting ring cyclotrons accelerating molecular hydrogen ions (H2+) to
800 MeV/n with stripping extraction are being designed by L. Calabretta and his

fit to the azimuthal temperature or azimuthal vertical velocity profile
measured with the probes. We study the LSC in \Gamma=D/L=1/2 and \Gamma=1

$Pr=0.7$ at $Ra=1\times10^8$ the influence of plumes on the azimuthal
temperature and azimuthal vertical velocity profiles is stronger. Due to
passing plumes and/or the corner flow the apparent LSC orientation obtained
using a cosine fit can result in a misinterpretation of the character of the
large-scale flow. We introduce the relative LSC strength, which we define as
the ratio between the energy in the first Fourier mode and the energy in all

vertical velocity profiles, to further quantify the large-scale flow. For
$Ra=1\times10^8$ we find that this relative LSC strength is significantly lower
in a \Gamma=1/2 sample than in a \Gamma=1 sample, reflecting that the LSC is
much more pronounced in a \Gamma=1 sample than in a \Gamma=1/2 sample. The
determination of the relative LSC strength can be applied directly to available

interpret this finding as follows: In the rotating regime the heat is mainly
transported by vertically-aligned vortices. Since the vertically-aligned
vortices are local, the aspect ratio has a negligible effect on the heat
transport in the rotating regime. Indeed, a detailed analysis of vortex
statistics shows that the fraction of the horizontal area that is covered by
vortices is independent of the aspect ratio when $1/Ro \gg 1/Ro_c$. In

become inaccurate. Using the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations we

differences still exist for lower temperatures (T < 10 eV) and moderate

through a space of perturbed games and their equilibria, exploiting game
structure through fast computation of the Jacobian of the payoff function. They
are theoretically guaranteed to find at least one equilibrium of the game, and

first algorithm to exploit fine-grained structural properties of MAIDs.
Experimental results are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the
