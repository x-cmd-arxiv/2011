are an important subject of mathematical interest. They are related in a
natural way to semisimple Lie groups. In this work we introduce and study their
infinite dimensional generalization: Affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces. Affine
Kac-Moody symmetric spaces are infinite dimensional symmetric spaces associated
to affine Kac-Moody groups. They have the structure of tame Fr\'echet
manifolds; the natural Ad-invariant scalar product on affine Kac-Moody algebras
is Lorentzian, making affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces into Lorentzian
symmetric spaces. Similar to affine Kac-Moody groups sharing most of their
structure properties with simple Lie group, also Kac-Moody symmetric spaces
share most of their structure properties with their finite dimensional
Riemannian counterparts. In particular the classification of Kac-Moody
symmetric spaces follows the lines of the classification of finite dimensional
Riemannian symmetric spaces: There are four types distinguished, which fall
into the two classes of Kac-Moody symmetric spaces of the compact type and of
the noncompact type. Symmetric spaces of the compact type and of the noncompact
type are related by a duality relation. In addition the geometry of the rank
1-building blocks is the same for Kac-Moody symmetric spaces as for finite
dimensional Riemannian symmetric spaces. Kac-Moody symmetric spaces appear in
mathematics and theoretical physics: for example their isotropy representations
are essentially equivalent to polar actions on Hilbert spaces; twin cities can
be embedded equivariantly into the tangent space. In theoretical physics
Kac-Moody symmetric spaces got recently a prominent place due to various
conjectures relating them to certain formulations of supergravity theories and
M-theory.

domain, DM/KDD are still in a very early usage stage, even though new methods
and tools are being continuously deployed in order to cope with the Massive
Data Sets (MDS) that can only grow in the future. In this paper, we briefly
outline some general problems encountered when applying DM/KDD methods to
astrophysical problems, and describe the DAME (DAta Mining & Exploration) web

effectively applied also to smaller data sets. As an illustration, we describe
two application of DAME to two different problems: the identification of
candidate globular clusters in external galaxies, and the classification of
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We believe that tools and services of this nature
will become increasingly necessary for the data-intensive astronomy (and indeed
all sciences) in the 21st century.

shows that an accretion disk model of M87's core out to 28 GM/c^2 can describe
the inner emissions. High spin rates show GRMHD-driven polar outflow
generation, without citing an external jet model. Our results favor accretion
rate changes as the dominant mechanism of x-ray flux and index changes, with
variations in density of approximately 20% necessary to scale between the
average x-ray spectrum and flaring or quiescent spectra. The best fit
parameters are black hole spin a/M > 0.8 and maximum accretion flow density n

spinors onto the space of pure SO(10) Weyl spinors is presented. The Jacobian
matrices of these projections are related to a linear projector which was
previously discussed in pure spinor string literature and which maps the
antighost to its gauge invariant part. Only one representative of the family
leads to a Hermitian Jacobian matrix and can itself be derived from a scalar
potential. Comments on the SO(1,9) case are given as well as on the
non-covariant version of the projection map. The insight is applied to the
ghost action of pure spinor string theory, where the constraints on the fields
can be removed using the projection, while introducing new gauge symmetries.
This opens the possibility of choosing different gauges which might help to
clarify the origin of the pure spinor ghosts. Also the measure of the pure

tri-indides showed that the dominant diffusion mechanism changed along that
series. The dominant mechanism was determined by comparing jump frequencies
measured at opposing phase boundary compositions (that is, more In-rich and
more In-poor). Jump frequencies were observed to be greater at the In-rich
boundary composition in light lanthanide indides and greater at the In-poor
boundary composition in heavy-lanthanide indides. These observations were
attributed to predominance of diffusion via rare-earth vacancies in the former
case and indium vacancies in the latter. Contrary to results for the indides,
jump frequencies found in the present work are greater for the Sn-poor boundary
compositions of the stannides, signaling that diffusive jumps are controlled by
Sn-vacancies. Possible origins of these differences in diffusion mechanisms are
discussed.

At a mean resonator occupation $\bar{n}$ = 1.5 photons, the readout visibility
is increased by a factor of 4.5 over that using a cryogenic semiconductor
amplifier. As $\bar{n}$ is increased from 0.008 to 0.1, no reduction in $T_1$
is observed, potentially enabling continuous monitoring of the qubit state.

radio source is detected with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 327 MHz.
The source is barely detected at 1.4 GHz in a NVSS pointing that we have
reanalyzed. The integrated radio spectrum of the halo is quite steep, with a
slope \alpha = 1.6 between 327 MHz and 1.4 GHz. While giant radio halos are
common in more X-ray luminous cluster mergers, there is a less than 10%
probability to detect a halo in systems with $L_X \ltsim 8 \times 10^{44}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. The detection of a new giant halo in this borderline luminosity
regime can be particularly useful for discriminating between the competing
theories for the origin of ultrarelativistic electrons in clusters.
Furthermore, if our steep radio spectral index is confirmed by future deeper
radio observations, this cluster would provide another example of the recently
discovered population of ultra-steep spectrum radio halos, predicted by the
model in which the cluster cosmic ray electrons are produced by turbulent
reacceleration.

alone explain these as our ancestor galaxies? Or could they be representatives

We explore this latter hypothesis and argue that Surface Brightness Selection
Effects naturally bring into focus quite different dynasties from different
redshifts. Thus the HST z=7 galaxies could be examples of galaxies whose
descendants are both too small and too choked with dust to be recognizable in
our neighborhood easily today. Conversely the ancestors of the Milky Way and
its obvious neighbors will have completely sunk below the sky at z>1.2 although
their diffuse light could account for the missing Reionization flux. This
Succeeding Prominent Dynasties Hypothesis (SPDH) fits the existing observations
both naturally and well,including the bizarre distributions of galaxy surface
brightnesses found in deep fields, the angular size ~ inverse (1+z)
law,'Downsizing' which turns out to be an 'illusion' in the sense that it does
not imply evolution, 'Infant Mortality', i.e. the discrepancy between stars
born and stars seen, and finally the recently discovered and unexpected excess
of QSOAL DLAs at high redshift. If the SPDH is true then a large proportion of
galaxies remain sunk from sight, probably at all redshifts. We show that
fishing them out of the sky by their optical emissions alone will be
practically impossible, even when they are nearby. More ingenious methods will
be needed to detect them. It follows that disentangling galaxy evolution
through studying ever higher redshift galaxies may be a forlorn hope because
one will be comparing young apples with old oranges, not descendants with their
own ancestors.

unknown Ultra-fast Outflows (UFOs) in radio-quiet AGNs. In the previous paper
of this series we defined UFOs as those absorbers with an outflow velocity
higher than 10,000km/s and assessed the statistical significance of the
associated blueshifted FeK absorption lines in a large sample of 42 local
radio-quiet AGNs observed with XMM-Newton. In the present paper we report a
detailed curve of growth analysis and directly model the FeK absorbers with the
Xstar photo-ionization code. We confirm that the frequency of sources in the
radio-quiet sample showing UFOs is >35%. The outflow velocity distribution
spans from \sim10,000km/s (\sim0.03c) up to \sim100,000km/s (\sim0.3c), with a
peak and mean value of \sim42,000km/s (\sim0.14c). The ionization parameter is
very high and in the range log\xi 3-6erg s^{-1} cm, with a mean value of log\xi
4.2 erg s^{-1} cm. The associated column densities are also large, in the range
N_H\sim10^{22}-10^{24} cm^{-2}, with a mean value of N_H\sim10^{23} cm^{-2}. We
discuss and estimate how selection effects, such as those related to the
limited instrumental sensitivity at energies above 7keV, may hamper the
detection of even higher velocities and higher ionization absorbers. We argue
that, overall, these results point to the presence of extremely ionized and
possibly almost Compton thick outflowing material in the innermost regions of
AGNs. This also suggests that UFOs may potentially play a significant role in
the expected cosmological feedback from AGNs and their study can provide
important clues on the connection between accretion disks, winds and jets.

we derive AGN luminosity functions in the redshift bins 3-4, 4-5 and >5.8 and
for 42.75<log L(2-10 keV)<44.5. We join this data with the luminous AGN
luminosity functions from optical surveys and find that the evolution of the
high-z, wide luminosity range luminosity function can be best modeled by pure
luminosity evolution with L* decreasing from 6x10^44 ergs/s at z=3 to
L*=2x10^44 ergs/s at z=6. We compare the high-z luminosity function with the
prediction of theoretical models using galaxy interactions as AGN triggering
mechanism. We find that these models are broadly able to reproduce the high-z
AGN luminosity functions. A better agreement is found assuming a minimum Dark
Matter halo mass for black hole formation and growth. We compare our AGN
luminosity functions with galaxy mass functions to derive high-z AGN duty cycle
using observed Eddington ratio distributions to derive black hole masses. We
find that the duty cycle increases with galaxy stellar mass and redshift by a
factor 10-30 from z=0.25 to z=4-5. We also report on the detection of a large
fraction of highly obscured, Compton thick AGN at z>3 (18+17-10%). Their
optical counterparts are not strongly reddened and we thus conclude that the
size of the X-ray absorber is likely smaller than the dust sublimation radius.
We finally report the discovery of a highly star-forming galaxy at z=3.47. If
confirmed, this would be one of the farthest objects in which stellar sources
are detected in X-rays.

Combining with the previous result that decoding delay should be an integer

motion resonances, i.e. a resonance involving the Keplerian periods of the two
lighter bodies revolving around the most massive one. This problem is often
used to model Sun--Jupiter--asteroid systems. For the primaries (Sun and
Jupiter), we pick a realistic mass ratio $\mu=10^{-3}$ and a small eccentricity
$e_0>0$. The main result is a construction of a variety of non local diffusing
orbits which show a drastic change of the osculating (instant) eccentricity of
the asteroid, while the osculating semi major axis is kept almost constant. The
proof relies on the careful analysis of the circular problem, which has a
hyperbolic structure, but for which diffusion is prevented by KAM tori. We
verify certain non-degeneracy conditions numerically.
  Based on the work of Treschev, it is natural to conjecture that diffusion
time for this problem is $\sim \frac{-\ln (\mu e_0)}{\mu^{3/2} e_0}$. We expect
our instability mechanism to apply to realistic values of $e_0$ and we give
heuristic arguments in its favor. If so, the applicability of Nekhoroshev
theory to the three-body problem as well as the long time stability become
questionable.
  It is well known that, in the Asteroid Belt, located between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter, the distribution of asteroids has the so-called Kirkwood gaps
exactly at mean motion resonances of low order. Our mechanism gives a possible
explanation of their existence. To relate the existence of Kirkwood gaps with
Arnold diffusion, we state a conjecture on its existence for a typical
$\eps$-perturbation of the product of a pendulum and a rotator. Namely, we
predict that a positive conditional measure of initial conditions concentrated
in the main resonance exhibits Arnold diffusion on time scales $\frac{- \ln
\eps}{\eps^{2}}$.

epoch in which massive galaxies are believed to undergo significant structural
and mass evolution. We observe that the pair fraction of massive galaxies is
0.15 \pm 0.08 at 1.7 < z < 3.0, where galaxy pairs are defined as massive
galaxies having a companion of flux ratio from 1:1 to 1:4 within a projected
separation of 30 kpc. This is slightly lower, but still consistent with the
pair fraction measured previously in other studies, and the merger fraction
predicted in halo-occupation modelling. The redshift evolution of the pair
fraction is described by a power law F(z) = (0.07 \pm 0.04) * (1+z) ^ (0.6 \pm
0.5). The merger rate is consistent with no redshift evolution, however it is
difficult to constrain due to the limited sample size and the high
uncertainties in the merging timescale. Based on the merger rate calculation,
we estimate that a massive galaxy undergoes on average 1.1 \pm 0.5 major merger
from z = 3 to 0. The observed merger fraction is sufficient to explain the
number density evolution of massive galaxies, but insufficient to explain the

population is calculated on the supposition that all stars form as binaries in
embedded star clusters. A recently developed tool (Marks, Kroupa & Oh) is used
to evolve the binary star distributions in star clusters for a few Myr so that
a particular mixture of single and binary stars is achieved. On cluster
dissolution the population enters the galactic field with these
characteristics. The different contributions of single stars and binaries from
individual star clusters which are selected from a power-law embedded star
cluster mass function are then added up. This gives rise to integrated galactic
field binary distribution functions (IGBDFs) resembling a galactic field's
stellar content (Dynamical Population Synthesis). It is found that the binary
proportion in the galactic field of a galaxy is larger the lower the minimum
cluster mass, the lower the star formation rate, the steeper the embedded star
cluster mass function and the larger the typical size of forming star clusters
in the considered galaxy. In particular, period-, mass-ratio- and eccentricity
IGBDFs for the Milky Way are modelled. The afore mentioned theoretical IGBDFs
agree with independently observed distributions. Of all late-type binaries, 50%
stem from M<300M_sun clusters, while 50% of all single stars were born in
M>10^4M_sun clusters. Comparison of the G-dwarf and M-dwarf binary population
indicates that the stars formed in mass-segregated clusters. In particular it
is pointed out that although in the present model all M-dwarfs are born in
binary systems, in the Milky Way's Galactic field the majority ends up being
single stars. This work predicts that today's binary frequency in elliptical
galaxies is lower than in spiral and in dwarf-galaxies. The period and

classical bulges or pseudobulges. Classical bulges are thought to form by
galactic merger with bursty star formation, whereas pseudobulges are suggested
to form by secular evolution due to spiral arms and a barred structure
funneling gas into the galactic centre. Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another
bulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a
numerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form
clumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc
is expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic
centre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre. This
bulge formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the
high-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution.
Therefore, clump-origin bulges may have their own unique properties. We perform
a high-resolution N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation for
the formation of the clump-origin bulge in an isolated galaxy model and study
dynamical and chemical properties of the clump-origin bulge. We find that the
clump-origin bulge resembles pseudobulges in dynamical properties, a nearly
exponential surface density profile, a barred boxy shape and a significant
rotation. We also find that this bulge consists of old and metal-rich stars,
displaying resemblance to classical bulges. These natures, old metal-rich
population but pseudobulge-like structures, mean that the clump-origin bulge
can not be simply classified into classical bulges nor pseudobulges. From these
results, we discuss similarities of the clump-origin bulge to the Milky Way
bulge.

are > 10 Msun. The inclusion of Fe and Si cooling does not affect the thermal
evolution as this is dominated by molecular cooling even for metallicities as
large as Z = 10^{-2} Zsun. The presence of dust is the key driver for the
formation of low-mass stars. We focus on three representative core-collapse
supernova (SN) progenitors, and consider the effects of reverse shocks of
increasing strength: these reduce the depletion factors, fdep =
Mdust/(Mdust+Mmet), alter the shape of the grain size distribution function and
modify the relative abundances of grain species and of metal species in the gas
phase. We find that the lowest metallicity at which fragmentation occurs is
Z=10^{-6} Zsun for gas pre-enriched by the explosion of a 20 Msun primordial SN
(fdep > 0.22) and/or by a 35 Msun, Z=10^{-4} Zsun SN (fdep > 0.26); it is ~ 1
dex larger, when the gas is pre-enriched by a Z = 10^{-4} Zsun, 20 Msun SN
(fdep > 0.04). Cloud fragmentation depends on the depletion factor and it is
suppressed when the reverse shock leads to a too large destruction of dust
grains. These features are all consistent with the existence of a minimum
dust-to-gas ratio, Dcr, above which fragmentation is activated. We derive a
simple analytic expression for Dcr which, for grain composition and properties
explored in the present study, reads Dcr = [2.6 - 6.3] x 10^{-9}. When the
dust-to-gas ratio of star forming clouds exceeds this value, the fragmentation

Under the assumption of a fully populated Chabrier IMF, we compare the

SFHs with observations of 185 galaxies from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy
survey. We find a set of SFH models that are well matched to the data, such
that more massive galaxies are best characterized by nearly constant SFHs,
while low mass systems experience bursts amplitudes of ~ 30 (i.e., an increase
in the SFR by a factor of 30 over the SFR during the inter-burst period), burst
durations of tens of Myr, and periods of ~ 250 Myr; these SFHs are broadly
consistent with the increased stochastic star formation expected in systems
with lower SFRs. We analyze the predicted temporal evolution of galaxy stellar
mass, R-band surface brightness, Halpha-derived SFR, and blue luminosity, and
find that they provide a reasonable match to observed flux distributions. We
find that our model SFHs are generally able to reproduce both the observed
systematic decline and increased scatter in Halpha-to-FUV ratios toward low
mass systems, without invoking other physical mechanisms. We also compare our
predictions with those from the Integrated Galactic IMF theory with a constant
SFR. We find that while both predict a systematic decline in the observed
ratios, only the time variable SFH models are capable of producing the observed
population of low mass galaxies ($M_{*}$ < 10$^{7}$ Msun) with normal
Halpha-to-FUV ratios. These results demonstrate that a variable IMF alone has
difficulty explaining the observed scatter in the Halpha-to-FUV ratios. We
conclude by considering the limitations of the model SFHs, and discuss the use

interesting case study because BDs' terrestrial planet forming region is
located extremely close-in. In fact, the habitable zones of BDs range from
roughly 0.001 to 0.03 AU and for the lowest-mass BDs are located interior to
the Roche limit. In contrast with stars, BDs spin up as they age. Thus, the
corotation distance moves inward. This has important implications for the tidal
evolution of planets around BDs. We used a standard equilibrium tidal model to
compute the orbital evolution of a large ensemble of planet-BD systems. We
tested the effect of numerous parameters such as the initial semi-major axis
and eccentricity, the rotation period of the BD, the masses of both the BD and
planet, and the tidal dissipation factors. We find that all planets that form
at or beyond the corotation distance and with initial eccentricities smaller
than \sim 0.1 are repelled from the BD. Some planets initially interior to
corotation can survive if their inward tidal evolution is slower than the BD's
spin evolution, but most initially close-in planets fall onto the BD. We find
that the most important parameter for the tidal evolution is the initial
orbital distance with respect to the corotation distance. Some planets can
survive in the habitable zone for Gyr timescales, although in many cases the
habitable zone moves inward past the planet's orbit in just tens to hundreds of
Myr. Surviving planets can have orbital periods of less than 10 days (as small
as 10 hrs), so they could be observable by transit.

root $\dd$ of $A$ and each indecomposable irreducible component $C$ of

isomorphic to $k$ or $k(x)$. Next, we show that the tame tilted algebras are
precisely those tilted algebras $A$ with the property that for each generic

just $\mathbb P^1$ whenever $\theta$ is an integral weight for which
$C^s_{\theta}\neq \emptyset$. We furthermore show that the tameness of a tilted

show that the smoothness of the various moduli spaces of modules for a strongly

algebras behave with respect to tilting functors, and to theta-stable
decompositions.

Alfv\'en speed and the magnetic field strength in the inner corona at a
heliocentric distance of ~ 1.4 Rs. The basic measurements are the shock
standoff distance (deltaR) ahead of the CME flux rope, the radius of curvature
of the flux rope (Rc), and the shock speed. We first derive the Alfv\'enic Mach
number (M) using the relationship, deltaR/Rc = 0.81[(gamma-1) M^2 +
2]/[(gamma+1)(M^2-1)], where gamma is the only parameter that needed to be
assumed. For gamma =4/3, the Mach number declined from 3.7 to 1.5 indicating
shock weakening within the field of view of the imager. The shock formation
coincided with the appearance of a type II radio burst at a frequency of ~300
MHz (harmonic component), providing an independent confirmation of the shock.
The shock compression ratio derived from the radio dynamic spectrum was found
to be consistent with that derived from the theory of fast mode MHD shocks.
From the measured shock speed and the derived Mach number, we found the
Alfv\'en speed to increase from ~140 km/s to 460 km/s over the distance range
1.2 to 1.5 Rs. By deriving the upstream plasma density from the emission
frequency of the associated type II radio burst, we determined the coronal
magnetic field to be in the range 1.3 to 1.5 G. The derived magnetic field
values are consistent with other estimates in a similar distance range. This
work demonstrates that the EUV imagers, in the presence of radio dynamic
spectra, can be used as coronal magnetometers.

STEREO did not have a magnetograph; SOHO did not have in-situ magnetometer.
SOHO and other imagers such as the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) located on
the Sun-Earth line are also not well-suited to measure Earth-directed CMEs. The
Earth-Affecting Solar Causes Observatory (EASCO) is a proposed mission to be
located at the Sun-Earth L5 that overcomes these deficiencies. The mission

equivalent to the ones appearing in a dielectric medium. The Lorentz violation
controls the radial extension (core of the solution) and the magnetic field
amplitude of the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices, yielding compactlike
defects in an alternative and simpler way than that of $k-$field models. At the
end, we consider the Lorentz-violating terms in the gauge and Higgs sectors. It
is shown that the full model also supports compactlike uncharged BPS vortices

solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The intensity variation due to CME
interaction reported in [1] is confirmed by expanding the investigation to all
the large SEP events of solar cycle 23. The large SEP events are separated into
two groups, one associated with CMEs running into other CMEs, and the other
with CMEs running into the ambient solar wind. SEP events with CME interaction
generally have a higher intensity. New possibilities such as the influence of
coronal holes on the SEP intensity are also discussed. For example, the
presence of a large coronal hole between a well-connected eruption and the
solar disk center may render the shock poorly connected because of the
interaction between the CME and the coronal hole. This point is illustrated
using the 2004 December 3 SEP event delayed by about 12 hours from the onset of
the associated CME. There is no other event at the Sun that can be associated
with the SEP onset. This event is consistent with the possibility that the
coronal hole interaction influences the connectivity of the CMEs that produce
SEPs, and hence the intensity of the SEP event.

stochastic collocation methods - are now in widespread use for sensitivity
analysis and uncertainty quantification. The pseudospectral variety of these
methods uses a numerical integration rule to approximate the Fourier-type
coefficients of a truncated expansion in orthogonal polynomials. For problems
in more than two or three dimensions, a sparse grid numerical integration rule
offers accuracy with a smaller node set compared to tensor product
approximation. However, when using a sparse rule to approximately integrate
these coefficients, one often finds unacceptable errors in the coefficients
associated with higher degree polynomials.
  By reexamining Smolyak's algorithm and exploiting the connections between
interpolation and projection in tensor product spaces, we construct a sparse
pseudospectral approximation method that accurately reproduces the coefficients
of basis functions that naturally correspond to the sparse grid integration
rule. The compelling numerical results show that this is the proper way to use
sparse grid integration rules for pseudospectral approximation.

giant planets formed and migrated in the protoplanetary disk to reach resonant
orbits with all planets inside 15 AU from the Sun. After the gas disk's
dispersal, Uranus and Neptune were likely scattered by gas giants, and
approached their current orbits while dispersing the transplanetary disk of
planetesimals, whose remains survived to this time in the region known as the
Kuiper belt. Here we performed N-body integrations of the scattering phase
between giant planets in an attempt to determine which initial states are
plausible. We found that the dynamical simulations starting with a resonant
system of four giant planets have a low success rate in matching the present
orbits of giant planets, and various other constraints (e.g., survival of the
terrestrial planets). The dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if
Jupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, and leads to final systems with
fewer than four planets. Several initial states stand out in that they show a
relatively large likelihood of success in matching the constraints. Some of the
statistically best results were obtained when assuming that the solar system
initially had five giant planets and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to
that of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected to interstellar space by Jupiter. This
possibility appears to be conceivable in view of the recent discovery of a
large number free-floating planets in interstellar space, which indicates that
planet ejection should be common.

quantitative measures of correlation and information flow between different
parts of a system. To this end, several notions of communicability have been
introduced and applied to a wide variety of real-world networks in recent
years. Several such communicability functions are reviewed in this paper. It is
emphasized that communication and correlation in networks can take place
through many more routes than the shortest paths, a fact that may not have been
sufficiently appreciated in previously proposed correlation measures. In
contrast to these, the communicability measures reviewed in this paper are
defined by taking into account all possible routes between two nodes, assigning
smaller weights to longer ones. This point of view naturally leads to the
definition of communicability in terms of matrix functions, such as the
exponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument
is either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the
network. Considerable insight on communicability can be gained by modeling a
network as a system of oscillators and deriving physical interpretations, both
classical and quantum-mechanical, of various communicability functions.
Applications of communicability measures to the analysis of complex systems are
illustrated on a variety of biological, physical and social networks. The last
part of the paper is devoted to a review of the notion of locality in complex
networks and to computational aspects that by exploiting sparsity can greatly
reduce the computational efforts for the calculation of communicability
functions for large networks.

constituting the independent on-shell degrees of freedom decouple. We find a
Dirac-type equation for the transversal polarizations, ensuring a causal
propagation. The equation of motion for the longitudinal part is also of
Dirac-type, but with respect to an `effective metric'. We obtain that for all
four-dimensional FRW solutions with a matter equation of state p = w rho and w
in (-1,1] the light cones of the effective metric are more narrow than the
standard cones, which are recovered for the de Sitter case w=-1. In particular,
this shows that the propagation of the longitudinal part, although non-standard

163607 is a metal-rich G5IV star with two planets. The inner planet has an
observed orbital period of 75.29 $\pm$ 0.02 days, a semi-amplitude of 51.1
$\pm$ 1.4 \ms, an eccentricity of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.02 and a derived minimum mass of
\msini = 0.77 $\pm$ 0.02 \mjup. This is the largest eccentricity of any known
planet in a multi-planet system. The argument of periastron passage is 78.7
$\pm$ 2.0$^{\circ}$; consequently, the planet's closest approach to its parent
star is very near the line of sight, leading to a relatively high transit
probability of 8%. The outer planet has an orbital period of 3.60 $\pm$ 0.02
years, an orbital eccentricity of 0.12 $\pm$ 0.06 and a semi-amplitude of 40.4
$\pm$ 1.3 \ms. The minimum mass is \msini = 2.29 $\pm$ 0.16 \mjup. HD 164509 is
a metal-rich G5V star with a planet in an orbital period of 282.4 $\pm$ 3.8
days and an eccentricity of 0.26 $\pm$ 0.14. The semi-amplitude of 14.2 $\pm$
2.7 \ms\ implies a minimum mass of 0.48 $\pm$ 0.09 \mjup. The radial velocities
of HD 164509 also exhibit a residual linear trend of -5.1 $\pm$ 0.7 \ms\ per
year, indicating the presence of an additional longer period companion in the
system. Photometric observations demonstrate that HD 163607 and HD 164509 are
constant in brightness to sub-millimag levels on their radial velocity periods.
This provides strong support for planetary reflex motion as the cause of the
radial velocity variations.

distributed antenna systems. We first establish the ergodic capacity of
distributed antennas, under different channel side information (CSI)
assumptions. We consider a generalized distributed antenna system with $N$
distributed ports, each of which is equipped with an array of $L$ transmit
antennas and constrained by a fixed transmit power. For this system we
calculate the downlink capacity to a single antenna receiver, under different
assumptions about the availability of the channel states at the transmitter.
Having established this information theoretic analysis of the ergodic capacity
of distributed antenna systems, this paper also investigates the effect of
antenna placement on the performance of such systems. In particular, we
investigate the optimal placement of the transmit antennas in distributed
antenna systems. We present a fairly general framework for this optimization
with no constraint on the location of the antennas. Based on stochastic
approximation theory, we adopt a formulation that is suitable for node
placement optimization in various wireless network scenarios. We show that
optimal placement of antennas inside the coverage region can significantly
improve the power efficiency of wireless networks.

Denjoy-Perron-Henstock-Kurzweil integrals, and which allows the integration of

  Our integral has the property that if $f$ is locally distributionally
integrable over the real line and $\psi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}%) $ is a test
function, then $f\psi$ is distributionally integrable, and the formula%
[<\mathsf{f},\psi> =(\mathfrak{dist}) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x) \psi(x)
\,\mathrm{d}% x\,,] defines a distribution
$\mathsf{f}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}) $ that has distributional point
values almost everywhere and actually $\mathsf{f}(x) =f(x) $ almost everywhere.
  The indefinite distributional integral $F(x) =(\mathfrak{dist})
\int_{a}^{x}f(t) \,\mathrm{d}t$ corresponds to a distribution with point values
everywhere and whose distributional derivative has point values almost
everywhere equal to $f(x).$
  The distributional integral is more general than the standard integrals, but
it still has many of the useful properties of those standard ones, including
integration by parts formulas, substitution formulas, even for infinite
intervals --in the Ces\`{a}ro sense--, mean value theorems, and convergence
theorems. The distributional integral satisfies a version of Hake's theorem.
Unlike general distributions, locally distributionally integrable functions can
be restricted to closed sets and can be multiplied by power functions with real
positive exponents.

(Hale-Bopp), are occasional visitors from the heatless periphery of the solar
system. Previous works hypothesized that a great majority of OCCs must
physically disrupt after one or two passages through the inner solar system,
where strong thermal gradients can cause phase transitions or volatile pressure
buildup. Here we study the fate of small debris particles produced by OCC
disruptions to determine whether the imprints of a hypothetical population of
OCC meteoroids can be found in the existing meteor radar data. We find that OCC
particles with diameters D<10 um are blown out from the solar system by
radiation pressure, while those with D>1 um have a very low Earth-impact
probability. The intermediate particle sizes, D=100 um, represent a sweet spot.
About 1% of these particles orbitally evolve by Poynting-Robertson drag to
reach orbits with semimajor axis a=1 AU. They are expected to produce meteors
with radiants near the apex of the Earth's orbital motion. We find that the
model distributions of their impact speeds and orbits provide a good match to
radar observations of apex meteors, except for the eccentricity distribution,
which is more skewed toward e=1 in our model. Finally, we propose an
explanation for the long-standing problem in meteor science related to the
relative strength of apex and helion/antihelion sources. As we show in detail,
the observed trend, with the apex meteors being more prominent in observations
of highly sensitive radars, can be related to orbital dynamics of particles
released on the long-period orbits.

system by Jupiter, thermally destroyed near the Sun, or physically disrupted by
collisions. Also, some are swept by the Earth (and other planets), producing
meteors. Here we develop a dynamical model for the solar system meteoroids and
use it to explain meteor radar observations. We find that the Jupiter Family
Comets (JFCs) are the main source of the prominent concentrations of meteors
arriving to the Earth from the helion and antihelion directions. To match the
radiant and orbit distributions, as measured by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar
(CMOR) and Advanced Meteor Orbit Radar (AMOR), our model implies that comets,
and JFCs in particular, must frequently disintegrate when reaching orbits with
low perihelion distance. Also, the collisional lifetimes of millimeter
particles may be longer (>10^5 yr at 1 AU) than postulated in the standard
collisional models (10^4 yr at 1 AU), perhaps because these chondrule-sized
meteoroids are stronger than thought before. Using observations of the Infrared
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) to calibrate the model, we find that the total
cross section and mass of small meteoroids in the inner solar system are
(1.7-3.5)x10^11 km^2 and 4x10^19 g, respectively, in a good agreement with
previous studies. The mass input required to keep the Zodiacal Cloud (ZC) in a

chi-square random variable of degree 2 in the TOA case. Moreover, we provide
formulas quantitatively describing the relationship among the mean and standard

apply it to the study of automorphism groups of path coalgebras and algebras.
We observe that any homomorphism of path coalgebras is uniquely determined by a
trans-datum, which is the basis of our work. Under this correspondence, we show
for any quiver $Q$ an isomorphism from $\aut(kQ^c)$ to $\Omega^*(Q)$, the group
of invertible trans-data from $Q$ to itself. We point out that the coradical
filtration gives to a tower of normal subgroups of $\aut(kQ^c)$ with all factor
groups determined. Generalizing this fact, we establish a Galois-like theory
for acyclic quivers, which gives a bijection between large subcoalgebras of the
path coalgebra and their Galois groups, relating large subcoalgebras of a path
coalgebra with certain subgroups of its automorphism group. The group
$\aut(kQ^c)$ is discussed by studying its certain subgroups, and the
corresponding trans-data are given explicitly. By the duality between reflexive
coalgebras and algebras, we therefore obtain some structural results of
$\aut(\hat{kQ^a})$ for a finite quiver $Q$, where $\hat{kQ^a}$ is the complete
path algebra. Moreover, we also apply these results to finite dimensional
elementary algebras and recover some classical results.

uncertain because a small fraction of the environment could be composed of a
vast number of different species. To better assess what remains unknown, we
propose instead to predict the fraction of the environment that belongs to

from an urn with an unknown composition, and under the sole assumption that
there are still undiscovered species, we show that conditionally unbiased
predictors and exact prediction intervals (of constant length in logarithmic
scale) are possible for the fraction of the environment that belongs to
unsampled classes. Our predictions are based on a Poissonization argument,
which we have implemented in what we call the Embedding algorithm. In fixed
i.e. non-randomized sample sizes, the algorithm leads to very accurate
predictions on a sub-sample of the original sample. We quantify the effect of
fixed sample sizes on our prediction intervals and test our methods and others
found in the literature against simulated environments, which we devise taking
into account datasets from a human-gut and -hand microbiota. Our methodology
applies to any dataset that can be conceptualized as a sample with replacement

that the success transmission density increases with the base station density,

assembly of neurons thanks to the distribution of times elapsed since the last

relative entropy methods, it is proved that for highly or weakly connected
networks the model exhibits relaxation to the steady state and for moderately
connected networks it is obtained numerical evidence of appearance of
self-sustained periodic solutions.
  Here, we go further and, using the particular form of the model, we quantify
the regime where relaxation to a stationary state occurs in terms of the
network connectivity. To introduce our methodology, we first consider the case
where the neurons are not connected and we give a new statement showing that
total asynchronous firing of neurons appears asymptotically. In a second step,
we consider the case with connections and give a low connectivity condition
that still leads to asynchronous firing. Our low connectivity condition is
somehow sharp because we can give an example, when this condition is not
fulfilled, where synchronous rhythmic activity occurs. Indeed, we are able to
build several explicit families of periodic solutions. Our construction is
fully nonlinear and the resynchronization of the neural activity in the network
does not follow from bifurcation analysis. It relies on an algebraically
nonlinear boundary condition that occurs in the model.These analytic results
are compared with numerical simulations under broader hypotheses and shown to
be robust.

redistributing magnetic flux in the dense molecular gas that occurs in regions

regions of low ionization using the heavy ion approximation. The simulations
are for regions of strong field (plasma \beta=0.1) and mildly supersonic
turbulence (M=3, corresponding to an Alfven mach number of 0.67). The velocity
power spectrum of the neutral gas changes from an Iroshnikov-Kraichnan spectrum
in the case of ideal MHD to a Burgers spectrum in the case of a shock-dominated
hydrodynamic system. The magnetic power spectrum shows a similar behavior. We
use a 1D radiative transfer code to post-process our simulation results; the
simulated emission from the CS J=2-1 and H13CO+ J=1-0 lines shows that the
effects of AD are observable in principle. Linewidths of ions are observed to
be less than those of neutrals, and we confirm previous suggestions that this
is due to AD. We show that AD is unlikely to affect the Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method for inferring field strengths unless the AD is stronger than generally
observed. Finally, we present the first fully 3D study of the enhancement of AD

relationship among G8.7-0.1 and the TeV unidentified source HESS J1804-216
provides us with an important clue on diffusion process of cosmic rays if
particle acceleration operates in the SNR. The GeV gamma-ray emission is
extended with most of the emission in positional coincidence with the SNR
G8.7-0.1 and a lesser part located outside the western boundary of G8.7-0.1.
The region of the gamma-ray emission overlaps spatially-connected molecular
clouds, implying a physical connection for the gamma-ray structure. The total
gamma-ray spectrum measured with LAT from 200 MeV--100 GeV can be described by
a broken power-law function with a break of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.6 (stat) $\pm$ 1.2
(sys) GeV, and photon indices of 2.10 $\pm$ 0.06 (stat) $\pm$ 0.10 (sys) below
the break and 2.70 $\pm$ 0.12 (stat) $\pm$ 0.14 (sys) above the break. Given
the spatial association among the gamma rays, the radio emission of G8.7$-$0.1,
and the molecular clouds, the decay of $\pi^{0}$s produced by particles
accelerated in the SNR and hitting the molecular clouds naturally explains the
GeV gamma-ray spectrum. We also find that the GeV morphology is not well
represented by the TeV emission from HESS J1804$-$216 and that the spectrum in
the GeV band is not consistent with the extrapolation of the TeV gamma-ray
spectrum. The spectral index of the TeV emission is consistent with the
particle spectral index predicted by a theory that assumes energy-dependent
diffusion of particles accelerated in an SNR. We discuss the possibility that
the TeV spectrum originates from the interaction of particles accelerated in
G8.7$-$0.1 with molecular clouds, and we constrain the diffusion coefficient of
the particles.

galaxies, since they constitute the most abundant galaxy population. Abundance
ratios and their variations due to star formation are key constraints to
chemical evolution models. The determination of these abundances in the dwarf
galaxies of the Local Universe is thus of extreme importance. However, these
objects are intrinsically faint and observational constraints to their
evolution can be obtained only for very nearby galaxies. NGC 185 is one of the
four brightest dwarf companions of M31, but unlike than the other three, NGC
147, NGC 205, and NGC 221 (M32) it has an important content of gas and dust. We
obtained deep spectroscopic observations of the H$\alpha$ emitting population
of NGC 185 using GMOS-N at Gemini. As a result, in addition to the bright
planetary nebulae (PNe) previously found in the galaxy and reported in the
literature, we found other, much fainter, PNe. We then re-calculated the
electron temperatures and chemical abundances of the brightest ones, and
derived, for the first time, their electron densities. Our characterisation of
the PN population properties is interpreted in terms of the chemical evolution
of NGC 185, which suggests that it has suffered a significant chemical
enrichment within the last $\sim$8 Gyr. We also discovered the first symbiotic
star in the galaxy and enlightened the properties of a known supernova remnant

the scattering of a so-called ""skewed coherence beam"", i.e., a short-coherence

remarkable advantage of suppressing the multiple scattering contribution of the

Waals model, the protein-protein interactions, which form the physical basis
for the cell functioning, are considered as a interactions of key importance.
It is postulated that protein molecules are situated in points of some space
lattice (the Ling model of a cell) they assemble to aggregates at equilibrium

protein conformation at the resting state and conformation changes while the
cell is passing from the resting state to the equilibrium state (dead

of proteins, in the second case proteins are folded and aggregated. Obtained
results prove the applicability of our approaches for thermodynamic

the usual energy-temperature response at constant volume, explicitly in terms

investigate the spin-thermopower of a quantum dot in a magnetic field. In the
particle-hole symmetric situation the temperature difference applied across the
dot drives a pure spin current without accompanying charge current. For
temperatures and fields at or above the Kondo temperature, but of the same
order of magnitude, the spin-Seebeck coefficient is large, of the order of
k_B/e. Via a mapping, we relate the spin-Seebeck coefficient to the
charge-Seebeck coefficient of a negative-U quantum dot where the corresponding
result was recently reported by Andergassen et al. in Phys. Rev. B 84, 241107
(2011). For several regimes we provide simplified analytical expressions. In
the Kondo regime, the dependence of the spin-Seebeck coefficient on the
temperature and the magnetic field is explained in terms of the shift of the
Kondo resonance due to the field and its broadening with the temperature and
the field. We also consider the influence of breaking the particle-hole
symmetry and show that a pure spin current can still be realized provided a
suitable electric voltage is applied across the dot. Then, except for large
asymmetries, the behavior of the spin-Seebeck coefficient remains similar to
that found in the particle-hole symmetric point.

  scientific computing on highly heterogeneous HPC platforms",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional heterogeneous parallel algorithms, designed for heterogeneous
clusters of workstations, are based on the assumption that the absolute speed
of the processors does not depend on the size of the computational task. This
assumption proved inaccurate for modern and perspective highly heterogeneous
HPC platforms. New class of algorithms based on the functional performance
model (FPM), representing the speed of the processor by a function of problem
size, has been recently proposed. These algorithms cannot be however employed
in self-adaptable applications because of very high cost of construction of the
functional performance model. The paper presents a new class of parallel
algorithms for highly heterogeneous HPC platforms. Like traditional FPM-based
algorithms, these algorithms assume that the speed of the processors is
characterized by speed functions rather than speed constants. Unlike the
traditional algorithms, they do not assume the speed functions to be given.
Instead, they estimate the speed functions of the processors for different
problem sizes during their execution. These algorithms do not construct the
full speed function for each processor but rather build and use their partial
estimates sufficient for optimal distribution of computations with a given
accuracy. The low execution cost of distribution of computations between
heterogeneous processors in these algorithms make them suitable for employment
in self-adaptable applications. Experiments with parallel matrix multiplication
applications based on this approach are performed on local and global
heterogeneous computational clusters. The results show that the execution time
of optimal matrix distribution between processors is significantly less, by
orders of magnitude, than the total execution time of the optimized
application.

  Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011",,,,"physics.acc-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A muon collider would be a powerful tool for exploring the energy-frontier
with leptons, and would complement the studies now under way at the LHC. Such a
device would offer several important benefits. Muons, like electrons, are point
particles so the full center-of-mass energy is available for particle
production. Moreover, on account of their higher mass, muons give rise to very
little synchrotron radiation and produce very little beamstrahlung. The first
feature permits the use of a circular collider that can make efficient use of
the expensive rf system and whose footprint is compatible with an existing
laboratory site. The second feature leads to a relatively narrow energy spread
at the collision point. Designing an accelerator complex for a muon collider is
a challenging task. Firstly, the muons are produced as a tertiary beam, so a
high-power proton beam and a target that can withstand it are needed to provide
the required luminosity of ~1 \times 10^34 cm^-2s^-1. Secondly, the beam is
initially produced with a large 6D phase space, which necessitates a scheme for
reducing the muon beam emittance (""cooling""). Finally, the muon has a short
lifetime so all beam manipulations must be done very rapidly. The Muon
Accelerator Program, led by Fermilab and including a number of U.S. national
laboratories and universities, has undertaken design and R&D activities aimed
toward the eventual construction of a muon collider. Design features of such a
facility and the supporting R&D program are described.

power series representation of the local encoding kernel (LEK) matrices and
global encoding kernel (GEK) matrices to establish its theoretical fundamentals
for practical implementations. From the encoding perspective, the GEKs of a
convolutional network code (CNC) are shown to be uniquely determined by its LEK
matrix $K(z)$ if $K_0$, the constant coefficient matrix of $K(z)$, is
nilpotent. This will simplify the CNC design because a nilpotent $K_0$ suffices
to guarantee a unique set of GEKs. Besides, the relation between coding
topology and $K(z)$ is also discussed. From the decoding perspective, the main
theme is to justify that the first $L+1$ terms of the GEK matrix $F(z)$ at a
sink $r$ suffice to check whether the code is decodable at $r$ with delay $L$
and to start decoding if so. The concomitant decoding scheme avoids dealing
with $F(z)$, which may contain infinite terms, as a whole and hence reduces the
complexity of decodability check. It potentially makes CNCs applicable to
wireless networks.

concerning their formation mechanism and dynamical evolution. There are both
observational and numerical evidences indicating that open clusters evolve from
an initial clumpy structure, presumably a direct consequence of the formation
in a fractal medium, toward a centrally condensed state. This simple picture
has, however, several drawbacks. There can be very young clusters exhibiting
radial patterns maybe reflecting the early effect of gravity on primordial gas.
There can be also very evolved cluster showing fractal patterns that either
have survived through time or have been generated subsequently by some
(unknown) mechanism. Additionally, the fractal structure of some open clusters
is much clumpier than the average structure of the interstellar medium in the
Milky Way, although in principle a very similar structure should be expected.
Here we summarize and discuss observational and numerical results concerning
this subject.

was developed in 1950 by Per-Olov L\""owdin. Our objective is to obtain a set of
N orthogonal (L\""owdin) pulses, which remain time-limited and spectrally
efficient for UWB systems, from a set of N equidistant translates of a
time-limited optimal spectral designed UWB pulse. We derive an approximate
L\""owdin orthogonalization (ALO) by using circulant approximations for the Gram
matrix to obtain a practical filter implementation. We show that the centered
ALO and L\""owdin pulses converge pointwise to the same Nyquist pulse as N tends
to infinity. The set of translates of the Nyquist pulse forms an orthonormal
basis or the shift-invariant space generated by the initial spectral optimal
pulse. The ALO transform provides a closed-form approximation of the L\""owdin
transform, which can be implemented in an analog fashion without the need of
analog to digital conversions. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay
between the optimization and the orthogonalization procedure by using methods
from the theory of shift-invariant spaces. Finally we develop a connection

(Chowla).} {\em \begin{equation} \label{a.1} \sum_{n\le x} \lambda (f(n)) =o(x)
\end{equation} for any polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients which is not
of form $bg(x)^2$. } \vspace{1mm} \noindent The prime number theorem is
equivalent to \eqref{a.1} when $f(x)=x$. Chowla's conjecture is proved for
linear functions but for the degree greater than 1, the conjecture seems to be
extremely hard and still remains wide open. One can consider a weaker form of
Chowla's conjecture, namely, \vspace{1mm} \noindent {\bf Conjecture 1
(Cassaigne, et al).} {\em If $f(x) \in \Z [x]$ and is not in the form of
$bg^2(x)$ for some $g(x)\in \Z[x]$, then $\lambda (f(n))$ changes sign
infinitely often.}
  Clearly, Chowla's conjecture implies Conjecture 1. Although it is weaker,
Conjecture 1 is still wide open for polynomials of degree $>1$. In this
article, we study Conjecture 1 for the quadratic polynomials. One of our main
theorems is
  {\bf Theorem 1.} {\em Let $f(x) = ax^2+bx +c $ with $a>0$ and $l$ be a
positive integer such that $al$ is not a perfect square. Then if the equation
$f(n)=lm^2 $ has one solution $(n_0,m_0) \in \Z^2$, then it has infinitely many
positive solutions $(n,m) \in \N^2$.}
  As a direct consequence of Theorem 1, we prove some partial results of
Conjecture 1 for quadratic polynomials are also proved by using Theorem 1.

exhibits a nonadiabatic behavior in which the superconducting order parameter

product obtained from the continuity equation can be interpreted as a conserved
corre- lation function. This leads to physical conclusions, regarding both
discrete and continuum states of such systems. Asymptotic states are shown to
have necessarily broken PT -symmetry, leading to modified scattering and
transfer matrices. This yields restricted boundary conditions, e.g., in-
cidence from both sides, analogous to that of the proposed PT CPA laser. The
interpretation of left and right states leads to a Hermitian S-matrix,
resulting in the non-conservation of the flux. This further satisfies a duality
condition, identical to the optical analogues. However, the non-local conserved
scalar implements alternate boundary conditions in terms of in and out states,
leading to the pseudo-Hermiticity condition in terms of the scattering matrix.
Interestingly, when PT -symmetry is preserved, it leads to stationary states
with real energy, naturally inter- pretable as bound states. The broken PT
-symmetric phase is also captured by this correlation, with complex-conjugate
pair of energies, interpreted as resonances.

construct a compact distance oracle that can answer queries of the form: ""what
is the distance from v to the closest lambda-labeled node"" for a given node v
in V and label lambda in L.
  This problem was introduced by Hermelin, Levy, Weimann and Yuster [ICALP
2011] where they present several results for this problem. In the first result,
they show how to construct a vertex-label distance oracle of expected size
O(kn^{1+1/k}) with stretch (4k - 5) and query time O(k). In a second result,
they show how to reduce the size of the data structure to O(kn \ell^{1/k}) at
the expense of a huge stretch, the stretch of this construction grows
exponentially in k, (2^k-1). In the third result they present a dynamic
vertex-label distance oracle that is capable of handling label changes in a
sub-linear time. The stretch of this construction is also exponential in k, (2
3^{k-1}+1).
  We manage to significantly improve the stretch of their constructions,
reducing the dependence on k from exponential to polynomial (4k-5), without
requiring any tradeoff regarding any of the other variables.
  In addition, we introduce the notion of vertex-label spanners: subgraphs that
preserve distances between every node v and label lambda. We present an
efficient construction for vertex-label spanners with stretch-size tradeoff
close to optimal.

$\upsilon$~And~b is measured to further constrain its orbit, mass, density, and
geometrical albedo. We obtained polarimetric measurements in the $UBV$ bands
over the orbital period and deduce an average peak-to-peak amplitude of $(49
\pm 5)\times10^{-6}$ in both Stokes $q$ and $u$. From our data we evaluate the
orbit inclination $i=111\degr\pm11\degr$, longitude of the ascending node
$\Omega=236\degr\pm12\degr$ (or equivalently 56\degr), the effective size of
the scattering atmosphere in the optical blue of $1.36\pm0.20$\,$R_{\rm J}$.
These combined with spectroscopic measurements result in the planet mass
$0.74\pm0.07$\,$M_{\rm J}$, mean density $0.36\pm0.08$\,g\,cm$^{-3}$, and
surface gravity $\sim10^3$\,cm\,s$^{-2}$, which favor a close similarity of
$\upsilon$~And~b to other inflated hot Jupiters. We also significantly improved

epoch $T_{\rm t}={\rm JD}2,450,034.668$, and periastron longitude
$\omega=279\degr\pm14\degr$. The latter indicates that the apsidal resonance
known for planets c and d includes also planet b.
  Obtained limits on the wavelength dependent geometrical albedo (average 0.35)
indicate its similarity to Neptune with peak reflectivity in the blue.
Combining all available measurements at various passbands, we construct a
unified wavelength dependent albedo of an average hot Jupiter. It appears to be
largely shaped by Rayleigh scattering in the blue and atomic and molecular
absorption in the optical and near infrared. Our findings demonstrate the power
of polarimetry for studying non-transiting exoplanets.

It has been proposed that this extra site functions as a link between the
chlorosome antenna complex and the remaining seven chromophores in FMO [Schmidt
am Busch et al, J. Phys. Chem. Lett., {\bf 2}, 93 (2011)]. Here, we investigate
the implications of this scenario through numerical calculations with the
generalized Bloch-Redfield (GBR) equation and the non-interacting blip
approximation (NIBA). Three key insights into the population dynamics and
energy transfer efficiency in FMO are provided. First, it is shown that the
oscillations that are often observed in the population relaxation of the dimer
composed of sites one and two may be completely suppressed in the eight site
model. The presence of the coherent oscillations is shown to depend upon the
particular initial preparation of the dimer state. Secondly it is demonstrated
that while the presence of the eighth chromophore does not cause a dramatic
change in the energy transfer efficiency, it does however lead to a dominant
energy transfer pathway which can be characterized by an effective three site
system arranged in an equally spaced downhill configuration. Such a
configuration leads to an optimal value of the site energy of the eighth
chromophore which is shown to be near to its suggested value. Finally we
confirm that the energy transfer process in the eight site FMO complex remains
efficient and robust. The optimal values of the bath parameters are computed
and shown to be closer to the experimentally fitted values than those
calculated previously for the seven site system.
