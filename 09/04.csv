Keck/LRIS, we report the detection at z = 0.7 of an extremely metal-poor galaxy

affect the broadband flux density with a median brightening of 0.3 mag, with
examples producing brightening of up to 1 mag. The presence of strong emission
lines in low-z galaxies can mimic the color-selection criteria used in the z ~
8 dropout surveys. In order to effectively remove low redshift interlopers,
deep optical imaging is needed, at least 1 mag deeper than the bands in which
the objects are detected. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that strong
nebular lines can lead to an overestimation of the mass and the age of galaxies
derived from fitting of their SED. Without removing emission lines, the age and
the stellar mass estimates are overestimated by a factor of 2 on average and up
to a factor of 10 for the high-EW galaxies. Therefore the contribution of
emission lines should be systematically taken into account in SED fitting of
star-forming galaxies at all redshifts.

that inclusion of quadratic terms in the equilibrium distribution improves the

barkappa^{-1}) and, for the minimal models of interest here, barkappa = p/p'
where p and p' are two coprime integers. The geometric exponents of the hull
and external perimeter are studied for the pairs (p,p') = (1,1), (2,3), (3,4),
(4,5), (5,6), (5,7), and that of the red bonds for (p,p') = (3,4). Monte Carlo
upgrades are proposed for these models as well as several techniques to improve
their speeds. The measured fractal dimensions are obtained by extrapolation on
the lattice size H,V -> infinity. The extrapolating curves have large slopes;
despite these, the measured dimensions coincide with theoretical predictions up
to three or four digits. In some cases, the theoretical values lie slightly
outside the confidence intervals; explanations of these small discrepancies are
proposed.

sublimating mass away from the substellar point, the atmospheres do not extend
much beyond the day-night terminators. Ground temperatures, which determine the

Atmospheric temperatures, however, which control cloud condensation and thus
albedo properties, can deviate substantially from the irradiation pattern.
Magnetic drag and ohmic dissipation can also strongly impact the atmospheric
behavior, depending on atmospheric composition and the planetary magnetic field
strength. We conclude that hot super-Earths could exhibit interesting

licensing models (content, source, data), should be seen as part of a broader
socio-economic phenomenon that finds legal expression in specific
organizational and technical formats.This paper examines the origins and main
characteristics of the open archives phenomenon. We investigate the extent to
which different models of production of economic or social value can be
expressed in different forms of licensing in the context of open archives.
Through this process, we assess the extent to which the digital archive is
moving towards providing access that is deeper (meaning, that offers more
access rights) and wider (in the sense that most of the information given is in
open content licensing) or face a gradual stratification and polarization of
the content. Such stratification entails the emergence of two types of content:
content to which access is extremely limited and content to which access
remains completely open. This differentiation between classes of content is the
result of multiple factors: from purely legislative, administrative and
contractual restrictions (e.g. data protection and confidentiality
restrictions) to information economics (e.g. peer production) or social
(minimum universal access).
  We claim that with respect to the access management model, most of the
current archiving processes include elements of openness. Usually, this is the
result of economic necessity expressed in licensing instruments or
organisational arrangements. The viability and the socio-economic importance of
the digital archives also contributes to the use of open archiving practices.
In such a context, although pure forms of open digital archives may remain an
ideal, the reality of hybrid open digital archives is a necessity.

provide a generic optimization framework for linear precoding design to handle
any objective functions of data rate with general linear and nonlinear power
constraints. To achieve this, an iterative algorithm which optimizes the
precoding vectors and power allocation alternatingly is proposed and most
importantly, the proposed algorithm is proved to always converge. The proposed
optimization algorithm is also applicable to nonlinear dirty paper coding. In
addition, the aforementioned problems and algorithms are extended to the case
that each terminal has multiple co-polarization or dual-polarization antennas.
Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance improvement of the
proposed schemes over conventional multibeam satellite systems, zero-forcing

to be very close to the dirty paper coding.

results on this fundamental problem imply that for some well known classes of

between photon and baryon fluids. It is found that the magnetic fields from the

initial fluctuations, where the magnetic fields can be generated only at the
second-order. In a general case where the primordial density perturbations

proportional to $k_{i}^{\phi}$, where $k_{i}$ is the degree of node $i$ and
$\phi$ is a adjustable parameter. We have applied this model on the shortest
path routing strategy as well as the local routing strategy, and found that
there exists an optimal value of parameter $\phi$ leading to the maximal

  resolution of the classical self-force problem?","This paper has been withdrawn by the author. See arXiv:1201.5281",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The self-force problem of classical electrodynamics has two closely linked
facets: The ill defined dynamics of a point charge due to the divergent self
field at the position of the charge, and the divergence of formally conserved
quantities, such as the energy, associated with symmetries of the corresponding
Lagrangian. Fixing the self-force problem amounts to the construction of a
\emph{new} theory, which is free of the above pathologies and yet ""sufficiently
close"" to the immensely successful original. In a recent paper by the present
author such a proposal, dubbed extended charge dynamics (ECD), was presented.
The essential ingredients of classical electrodynamics preserved by ECD (and,
among the plethora of solutions to the problem, only by ECD) are:
  - Ontology. The electromagnetic field is the same unquantized classical
field, while charges are sufficiently localized conserved currents, accounting
for the manifest corpuscular nature of elementary charges.
  - Symmetries. ECD enjoys the full symmetry group of classical
electrodynamics, most importantly the hidden symmetry of scale covariance.
  - Conservation laws. All ECD conservation laws formally coincide with their
classical counterparts, and yet lead to finite conserved quantities.
  Despite this seemingly classical setting, and the reduction of ECD to
classical electrodynamics in the latter's domain of validity, it is shown in
the present paper that ensembles of ECD solutions could, in principle,
reproduce the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics. Exclusively quantum
mechanical concepts, such as interference, violations of Bell's inequalities,
spin and even photons (despite the use of a classical EM field), all emerge as
mere statistical manifestations of the self interaction of ECD charges.

Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is
dominated by single or several strong lines from ions that under equilibrium
conditions are formed in a narrow range of temperatures. However, most SDO/AIA
channels also contain contributions from lines of ions that have formation
temperatures that are significantly different from the ""dominant"" ion(s). We
investigate the importance of these lines by forward modeling the emission in
the SDO/AIA channels with 3D radiative MHD simulations of a model that spans
the upper layer of the convection zone to the low corona. The model is highly
dynamic. In addition, we pump a steadily increasing magnetic flux into the
corona, in order to increase the coronal temperature through the dissipation of
magnetic stresses. As a consequence, the model covers different ranges of
coronal temperatures as time progresses. The model covers coronal temperatures
that are representative of plasma conditions in coronal holes and quiet sun.
The 131, 171, and 304 \AA{} AIA passbands are found to be least influenced by
the so-called ""non-dominant"" ions, and the emission observed in these channels
comes mostly from plasma at temperatures near the formation temperature of the
dominant ion(s). On the other hand, the other channels are strongly influenced
by the non-dominant ions, and therefore significant emission in these channels
comes from plasma at temperatures that are different from the ""canonical""
values. We have also studied the influence of non-dominant ions on the AIA
passbands when different element abundances are assumed (photospheric and
coronal), and when the effects of the electron density on the contribution
function are taken into account.

star, which has extended observational constraints for this type of pulsator.
We constructed a dedicated database of stellar models and their oscillation
modes tuned to fit the dominant radial mode frequency of HD\,180642, by means
of varying the hydrogen content, metallicity, mass, age, and core overshooting
parameter. We compared the seismic properties of these models with those
observed. We find models that are able to explain the numerous observed
oscillation properties of the star, for a narrow range in mass of
11.4--11.8\,M$_\odot$ and no or very mild overshooting (with up to 0.05 local
pressure scale heights), except for an excitation problem of the $\ell=3$,
p$_1$ mode. We deduce a rotation period of about 13\,d, which is fully
compatible with recent magnetic field measurements. The seismic models do not
support the earlier claim of solar-like oscillations in the star. We instead
ascribe the power excess at high frequency to non-linear resonant mode coupling
between the high-amplitude radial fundamental mode and several of the low-order
pressure modes. We report a discrepancy between the seismic and spectroscopic
gravity at the $2.5\sigma$ level.

displaced peaks, one blueshifted and one redshifted from the systemic velocity

such line shapes could indicate a supermassive binary black hole (SMB) system.
We discuss here how the presence of an SMB will affect the BLRs of AGNs and
what the observational consequences might be.
  We review previous claims of SMBs based on broad line profiles and find that
they may have non-SMB explanations as a consequence of a complex BLR structure.
Because of these effects it is very hard to put limits on the number of SMBs
from broad line profiles. It is still possible, however, that unusual broad
line profiles in combination with other observational effects (line ratios,
quasi-periodical oscillations, spectropolarimetry, etc.) could be used for SMBs
detection.
  Some narrow lines (e.g., [O\,III]) in some AGNs show a double-peaked profile.
Such profiles can be caused by streams in the Narrow Line Region (NLR), but may
also indicate the presence of a kilo-parsec scale mergers. A few objects
indicated as double-peaked narrow line emitters are confirmed as kpc-scale
margers, but double-peaked narrow line profiles are mostly caused by the
complex NLR geometry.

system for understanding impurity effects in unconventional superconductors.
However, a crucial first step has been elusive; exact identification of the
microscopic states of the superfluid in the presence of quenched disorder.
Using a new class of highly uniform aerogel materials, we report pulsed nuclear
magnetic resonance experiments that demonstrate definitively that the two
observed superfluid states in aerogel are impure versions of the isotropic and
axial p-wave states. The theoretically predicted destruction of long-range
orbital order (Larkin-Imry Ma effect) in the impure axial state is not
observed.

theoretical concepts of $(k,l)$-sparsity, and make contact with the physical
concepts of ordinary and rigidity percolation. We then devise a renormalization
transformation for $(k,l)$-percolation problems, and investigate its domain of
validity. In particular, we show that it allows an exact solution of
$(k,l)$-percolation problems on hierarchical graphs, for $k\leq l<2k$. We
introduce and solve by renormalization such a model, which has the interesting
feature of showing both ordinary percolation and rigidity percolation phase
transitions, depending on the values of the parameters.

nonlinear first-order PDEs. These equations arise from the inner variation of
certain energy integrals. Even in the simplest model case of the Dirichlet
energy the inner-stationary solutions need not be differentiable everywhere;
the Lipschitz continuity is the best possible. But the proofs, even in the
Dirichlet case, turn out to relay on topological arguments. The appeal to the
inner-stationary solutions in this context is motivated by the classical
problems of existence and regularity of the energy-minimal deformations in the
theory of harmonic mappings and certain mathematical models of nonlinear
elasticity; specifically, neo-Hookian type problems.

tunnelling coupling with metallic leads is presented. The focus is put on the
dependence of the spectrum and the Franck-Condon factors on the geometry of the
junction including several vibronic modes. The relative size and the relative
position of the dot and its associated vibrons strongly influence the
electromechanical properties of the system. A detailed analysis of the complete
parameters space reveals different regimes: in the short vibron regime the
tunnelling of an electron into the nanotube generates a plasmon-vibron
excitation while in the long vibron regime polaron excitations dominate the
scenario. The small, position dependent Franck-Condon couplings of the small
vibron regime convert into uniform, large couplings in the long vibron regime.
Selection rules for the excitations of the different plasmon-vibron modes via
electronic tunnelling events are also derived.

blockade effect, in which the transport of one photon prevents the transport of
others, would be to separate two incoming indistinguishable photons to
different output ports. We show that time-energy uncertainty relations
inherently prevent this ideal situation when the blockade is implemented by a
two-level system. The fundamental nature of this limit is revealed in the fact
that photon blockade in the strong coupling regime of cavity QED, resulting
from the nonlinearity of the Jaynes-Cummings energy level structure, exhibits
efficiency and temporal behavior identical to those of photon blockade in the
bad cavity regime, where the underlying nonlinearity is that of the atom
itself. We demonstrate that this limit can be exceeded, yet not avoided, by
exploiting time-energy entanglement between the incident photons. Finally, we
show how this limit can be circumvented completely by using a three-level atom
coupled to a single-sided cavity, enabling an ideal and robust photon routing
mechanism.
