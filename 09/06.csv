Their
structure and existence conditions, as well as transitions between them are not
understood even in the case of the 'model' polymer polyethylene (PE). For
analysis of polymorphism in polymer crystals, we consider the simplest possible
model of polymer chain: an extended flat zigzag made of 'united' atoms
(replacing CH2-groups in PE chain); the united atoms belonging to different
zigzags interact via Lennard-Jones potential. Analysis of potential of
interaction between such zigzags allowed to predict the structure of five
possible equilibrium lattices in polymer crystal built out of such zigzags.
Molecular dynamics simulation of the crystal built out of flexible zigzags
showed that, depending on model parameters (dimensions of the zigzag and
equilibrium distance of Lennard-Jones potential), one to three of these
lattices are stable in bulk at low temperatures. We have determined the model
parameters at which the existing stable lattices are analogous to the ones
observed in real PE and linear alkanes. The triclinic lattice has the lowest
potential energy, then follows the monoclinic lattice, and the orthorhombic
lattice has the highest energy, exactly as in full atomic (with hydrogens)
molecular dynamics models.

candidates mined from the first three years of data of the CFHT SuperNova
Legacy Survey (SNLS). The images were submitted to a deferred processing
independent of the SNLS real-time detection pipeline. Light curves of all
transient events were reconstructed in the g_M, r_M, i_M and z_M filters and
submitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possible
supernovae. Pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by light
curve shape criteria. Type Ia supernova identification relied on event
characteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normal
SNe Ia. The light curve fitter SALT2 was used for this purpose, assigning host
galaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. The selected sample of 485
candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the SNLS spectroscopic
identification. The contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated to
be 4%. Testing Hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us to
measure the Malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. The result
is fully consistent with the precise Monte Carlo based estimate used to correct
SN Ia distance moduli in the SNLS 3-year cosmological analyses. This paper
demonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshift
supernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects for
cosmological analyses from future large photometric SN Ia surveys.

series of given observables exhibiting bimodal distributions, simple
one-dimensional Langevin models are fitted to reproduce the observed
statistical properties, and used to investing-ate the projected dynamics of the

changes in the properties of the underlying system or resonant behaviours like
those related to stochastic resonance-like mechanisms. In this paper, we
propose a framework for encasing this kind of studies and show, using simple

effect cluster known at z>0.6. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration
discovered El Gordo as the most significant SZ decrement in a sky survey area

redshift, z=0.870, and velocity dispersion, s=1321+/-106 km/s. Our Chandra
observations reveal a hot and X-ray luminous system with an integrated
temperature of Tx=14.5+/-1.0 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV band luminosity of
Lx=(2.19+/-0.11)x10^45 h70^-2 erg/s. We obtain several statistically consistent

X-ray Yx, and integrated SZ, we estimate a cluster mass of
M200a=(2.16+/-0.32)x10^15 M_sun/h70. The Chandra and VLT/FORS2 optical data
also reveal that El Gordo is undergoing a major merger between components with
a mass ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X-ray data show significant
temperature variations from a low of 6.6+/-0.7 keV at the merging low-entropy,
high-metallicity, cool core to a high of 22+/-6 keV. We also see a wake in the
X-ray surface brightness caused by the passage of one cluster through the
other. Archival radio data at 843 MHz reveal diffuse radio emission that, if
associated with the cluster, indicates the presence of an intense double radio
relic, hosted by the highest redshift cluster yet. El Gordo is possibly a
high-redshift analog of the famous Bullet Cluster. Such a massive cluster at
this redshift is rare, although consistent with the standard L-CDM cosmology in
the lower part of its allowed mass range. Massive, high-redshift mergers like
El Gordo are unlikely to be reproduced in the current generation of numerical

few extra parameters to the basic LCDM set. We include the two standard
parameters to model the current value for the dark energy equation of state and
its time derivative, w_0, w_a, and we account for the possibility of primordial
non-Gaussianity of the local, equilateral and orthogonal types, of parameter
fNL and, optionally, of spectral index n_fNL. We present forecasted constraints
on these parameters using the different observational probes. We show that
accounting for models that include primordial non-Gaussianity does not degrade
the constraint on the standard LCDM set nor on the dark-energy equation of
state. By combining the weak lensing data and the information on projected
galaxy clustering, consistently including all two-point functions and their
covariance, we find forecasted marginalised errors sigma (fNL) ~ 3, sigma
(n_fNL) ~ 0.12 from a Euclid-like survey for the local shape of primordial
non-Gaussianity, while the orthogonal and equilateral constraints are weakened

In this article, ""shape"" refers to (finitely many changes of) monotonicity,
convexity, or q-monotonicity of a function (for definition, see Section 4). It
is rather well known that it is possible to approximate a function by algebraic
polynomials that preserve its shape (i.e., the Weierstrass approximation
theorem is valid for SPA). At the same time, the degree of SPA is much worse
than the degree of best unconstrained approximation in some cases, and it is
""about the same"" in others. Numerous results quantifying this difference in
degrees of SPA and unconstrained approximation have been obtained in recent
years, and the main purpose of this article is to provide a ""bird's-eye view""
on this area, and discuss various approaches used.
  In particular, we present results on the validity and invalidity of uniform
and pointwise estimates in terms of various moduli of smoothness. We compare
various constrained and unconstrained approximation spaces as well as orders of
unconstrained and shape preserving approximation of particular functions, etc.
There are quite a few interesting phenomena and several open questions.

a multichannel partial-wave analysis which includes nearly all available data
on pion- and photo-induced reactions off protons. In the high-mass range, above
1850\,MeV, several alternative solutions yield a good description of the data.
For these solutions, masses, widths, pole residues and photo-couplings are
given. In particular, we find evidence for nucleon resonances with
spin-parities $J^P=1/2^+...7/2^+$. For one set of solutions, there are four
resonances forming naturally a spin-quartet of resonances with orbital angular
momentum L=2 and spin S=3/2 coupling to $J=1/2,...,7/2$. Just below 1.9\,GeV we
find a spin doublet of resonances with $J^P=1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. Since a spin
partner with $J^P=5/2^-$ is missing at this mass, the two resonances form a
spin doublet which must have a symmetric orbital-angular-momentum wave function
with L=1. For another set of solutions, the four positive-parity resonances are
accompanied by mass-degenerate negative-parity partners -- as suggested by the
conjecture of chiral symmetry restoration. The possibility of a $J^P=1/2^+,
3/2^+$ spin doublet at 1900\,MeV belonging to a 20-plet is discussed.

vulnerabilities, including the problem of Sybil attacks. Existing social
network-based solutions to mitigate the Sybil attacks in DHT routing have a
high state requirement and do not provide an adequate level of privacy. For
instance, such techniques require a user to reveal their social network
contacts. We design X-Vine, a protection mechanism for distributed hash tables
that operates entirely by communicating over social network links. As with
traditional peer-to-peer systems, X-Vine provides robustness, scalability, and
a platform for innovation. The use of social network links for communication
helps protect participant privacy and adds a new dimension of trust absent from
previous designs. X-Vine is resilient to denial of service via Sybil attacks,
and in fact is the first Sybil defense that requires only a logarithmic amount
of state per node, making it suitable for large-scale and dynamic settings.
X-Vine also helps protect the privacy of users social network contacts and
keeps their IP addresses hidden from those outside of their social circle,
providing a basis for pseudonymous communication. We first evaluate our design
with analysis and simulations, using several real world large-scale social
networking topologies. We show that the constraints of X-Vine allow the
insertion of only a logarithmic number of Sybil identities per attack edge; we
show this mitigates the impact of malicious attacks while not affecting the
performance of honest nodes. Moreover, our algorithms are efficient, maintain
low stretch, and avoid hot spots in the network. We validate our design with a
PlanetLab implementation and a Facebook plugin.

populations of stars. Theoretical models suggest that the second population is
formed from gas polluted by processed material produced by massive stars of the
first generation. However the nature of the polluter is a matter of strong
debate. Several candidates have been proposed: massive main-sequence stars
(fast rotating or binaries), intermediate-mass AGB stars, or SNeII. We studied
red giant branch (RGB) stars in the GC M4 (NGC 6121) to measure their chemical
signature. We confirm the presence of a bimodal population, first discovered by
Marino et al. (2008). The two groups have different C,$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C,N,O,Na
content, but share the same Li,C+N+O,Mg,Al,Si,Ca,Ti,Cr,Fe,Ni,Zr,Ba and Eu
abundance. Quite surprisingly the two groups differ also in their Y abundance.
The absence of a spread in $\alpha$-elements, Eu and Ba makes SNeII and AGB
stars unlikely as polluters. On the other hand, massive main-sequence stars can
explain the bimodality of Y through the weak s-process. This stement is
confirmed independently also by literature data on Rb and Pb. Observations
suggest that the mass of the polluters is between 20 and 30 M$_{\odot}$. This
implies a formation time scale for the cluster of 10$\div$30 Myrs. This result
is valid for M4. Other clusters like NGC 1851, M22, or $\omega$ Cen have
different chemical signatures and may require other kinds of polluter.

analytical and high-resolution numerical results based on random scattering of
shear-Alfv\'en waves propagating parallel to a large-scale magnetic field, as
well as direct simulations demonstrate rigorously an anisotropic energy
spectrum that scales as $k^{-2}_\perp$, instead of the famous
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK) spectrum of $k^{-3/2}$ for the isotropic case. Even
in the absence of a background magnetic field, anisotropy is found to develop
with respect to the local magnetic field, although the energy spectrum is
globally isotropic and is found to be consistent with a $k^{-3/2}$ scaling. It
is also found in direct numerical simulations that the energy cascade rate is
much closer to IK scaling than a Kolmogorov scaling. Recent observations in the
solar wind on cascade rates (as functions of the proton temperature and solar
wind speed at 1 AU) seem to support this result [Vasquez et al. 2007].

arbitrary mixed state, how does a measure for multipartite entanglement change
if general local operations are applied to the state? This question is
nontrivial as the normalization of the states has to be taken into account.
Here we answer it for pure-state entanglement measures which are invariant
under determinant 1 local operations and homogeneous in the state coefficients,
and their convex-roof extension which quantifies mixed-state entanglement. Our
analysis allows to enlarge the set of mixed states for which these important
measures can be calculated exactly. In particular, our results hint at a
distinguished role of entanglement measures which have homogeneous degree 2 in
the state coefficients.

explain the relationship between the fundamental concepts of set theory and

conceptual warrant and categorical design. Both are limitations of the logical
expression. Conceptual warrant limits the content of logical expression, by
requiring us to justify the introduction of new terminology (and attendant
axiomatizations). Categorical design limits the form of logical expression (of
all mathematical concepts and constraints) to atomic expressions: declarations,
equations or relational expressions. The IFF is a descriptive category
metatheory. It is descriptive, since it follows the principle of conceptual
warrant; it is categorical, since it follows the principle of categorical
design; and it is a metatheory, since it provides a framework for all theories.

activity in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is analyzed, for the first time,
based on NIR spectra. The 8 CLs studied, of Si, S, Fe, Al and Ca elements and
corresponding to ionization potentials (IP) in the range 125-450 eV, are
detected in 67% (36 AGNs) of the sample. The four most frequent CLs - [SiVI]
19630\AA, [SVIII] 9913\AA, [SIX] 12520\AA\ and [SiX] 14320\AA, - display a
narrow range in luminosity, with most lines located in the interval logL 39-40
erg/s. We found that the non-detection is largely associated with either a lost
of spatial resolution or increasing object distance. Yet, there are AGNs where
the lack of CLs may be genuine and reflect an AGN ionising continuum lacking
photons below a few keV. The FWHM of the lines profiles increases with
increasing IP up to energies around 300 eV, where a maximum in the FWHM is
reached. For higher IP lines, the FWHM remains nearly constant or decreases
with increasing IP. We ascribe this effect to an increasing density environment
as we approach to the innermost regions of the AGN, where densities above the
critical density of the CLs with IP larger than 300 eV are reached. This sets a
strict range limit for the density in the boundary region between the narrow
and the broad region of 10^8 - 10^9 cm^{-3}. A relationship between the
luminosity of the coronal lines and that of the soft and hard X-ray emission
and the soft X-ray photon index is observed: the coronal emission becomes
stronger with both increasing x-ray emission (soft and hard) and steeper X-ray
photon index. Thus, photoionization appears as the dominant excitation
mechanism. These trends hold when considering Type 1 sources only; they get
weaker or vanish when including Type 2 sources, very likely because the X-ray
emission measured in the later is not the intrinsic ionising continuum.

influenced by the density spectrum in which stars are formed and by the
response of the stellar structure to gas expulsion. We analyse hydrodynamical
simulations of turbulent fragmentation in star-forming regions to assess the
dynamical properties of the resulting population of stars and (sub)clusters.
Stellar subclusters are identified using a minimum spanning tree algorithm.
When considering only the gravitational potential of the stars and ignoring the
gas, we find that the identified subclusters are close to virial equilibrium
(the typical virial ratio Q_vir~0.59, where virial equilibrium would be
Q_vir~0.5). This virial state is a consequence of the low gas fractions within
the subclusters, caused by the accretion of gas onto the stars and the
accretion-induced shrinkage of the subclusters. Because the subclusters are
gas-poor, up to a length scale of 0.1-0.2 pc at the end of the simulation, they
are only weakly affected by gas expulsion. The fraction of subclusters that
reaches the high density required to evolve to a gas-poor state increases with
the density of the star-forming region. We extend this argument to star cluster
scales, and suggest that the absence of gas indicates that the early disruption
of star clusters due to gas expulsion (infant mortality) plays a smaller role
than anticipated, and is potentially restricted to star-forming regions with
low ambient gas densities. We propose that in dense star-forming regions, the
tidal shocking of young star clusters by the surrounding gas clouds could be
responsible for the early disruption. This `cruel cradle effect' would work in
addition to disruption by gas expulsion. We suggest possible methods to
quantify the relative contributions of both mechanisms.

relatively normal SN Ia, but does display high-velocity ejecta - the ejecta
velocity measured in our earliest spectra (v ~ -23,000 km/s for Si II 6355) is
the highest yet measured in a SN Ia. The spectral evolution is very dramatic at
times earlier than 12 days before maximum brightness, but slows after that
time. The early-time data provide a precise measurement of 17.13 +/- 0.07 days

significantly different from template light curves and spectra used for
light-curve fitting and K-corrections, indicating that the template light
curves and spectra do not properly represent all Type Ia supernovae at very
early times. In the age of wide-angle sky surveys, SNe like SN 2009ig that are
nearby, bright, well positioned, and promptly discovered will still be rare. As
shown with SN 2009ig, detailed studies of single events can provide
significantly more information for testing systematic uncertainties related to

supernovae feedback. We qualified the performances of GEAR with the case of
dSph galaxies. GEAR conserves the total energy budget of the systems to better
than 5% over 14Gyr and proved excellent convergence of the results with
numerical resolution. We showed that models of dSphs in a static Euclidean

we tackled some of the existing open questions in the field, like the stellar
mass fraction of dSphs and its link with the predicted dark matter halo mass
function, the effect of the supernova feedback, the spatial distribution of the
stellar populations, and the origin of the diversity in star formation
histories and chemical abundance patterns. Strong supernovae driven winds seem
incompatible with the observed metallicities and luminosities. Despite the fact
that newly formed stars are preferentially found in the galaxy central parts,
turbulent motions in the gas can quickly erase any metallicity gradient. The
variety in dSph properties result from a range of total masses as well as from
a dispersion in central densities. The latter is also seen in the haloes
emerging from a LCDM cosmogony.

(GRBs) at high redshift have supplied the first direct information on star
formation when the universe was only a few hundred million years old. The
probable origin of long duration GRBs in the deaths of massive stars would link
the universal GRB rate to the redshift-dependent star formation rate density,
although exactly how is currently unknown. As the most distant GRBs and
star-forming galaxies probe the reionization epoch, the potential rewards of
understanding the redshift-dependent ratio Psi(z) of the GRB rate to star
formation rate are significant and include addressing fundamental questions
such as incompleteness in rest-frame UV surveys for determining the star
formation rate at high redshift and time variations in the stellar initial mass
function. Using an extensive sample of 112 GRBs above a fixed luminosity limit
drawn from the Second Swift Burst Alert Telescope catalog, we compare the
cumulative redshift distribution N(< z) of GRBs with the star formation density
rho_sfr(z) measured from UV-selected galaxies over 0 < z < 4. Strong evolution
(e.g., Psi(z) \propto (1+z)^{1.5}) is disfavored, while more modest evolution
(e.g., Psi(z) \propto (1+z)^{0.5}) is consistent with the data. If such trends
continue beyond z ~ 4, we find the discovery rate of distant GRBs implies a
star formation rate density much higher than that inferred from UV-selected
galaxies. We show that such a star formation history would over-predict the
observed stellar mass density at z > 4 measured from rest-frame optical
surveys. The resolution of this important disagreement is currently unclear,
and the GRB production rate at early times is likely more complex than a simple
function of star formation rate and progenitor metallicity.

metallicities and determine abundances for as many elements as possible.
Method: The X-Shooter spectra are analysed by means of one-dimensional,

effects are computed using CO5BOLD hydrodynamical simulations. Results: All the
candidates are confirmed to be EMP stars, proving the efficiency of our

We are
now beginning to gather enough data to allow a realistic comparison between
different physical models. Two key tests for any theory of stellar rotation are
first whether it can match observations of the enrichment of nitrogen, and
potentially other elements, in clusters containing rapid rotators and secondly
whether it can reproduce the observed broadening of the main sequence in the
Hertzsprung-Russel diagram. Models of stellar rotation have been steadily
increasing in number and complexity over the past two decades but the lack of
data makes it difficult to determine whether such additions actually give a
closer reflection of reality. One of the most poorly explored features of
stellar rotation models is the treatment of angular momentum transport within
convective zones. If we treat the core as having uniform specific angular
momentum the angular momentum distribution in the star, for a given surface
rotation, is dramatically different from what it is when we assume the star
rotates as a solid body. The uniform specific angular momentum also generates
strong shears which can drive additional transport of chemical elements close
to the boundary of a convection zone. A comparison of different models and
their reproduction of observable properties with otherwise identical input
physics is essential to properly distinguish between them. We compare detailed
grids of stellar evolution tracks of intermediate and high-mass stars produced
using several models for rotation generated with our new stellar rotation code.

GOODS+ERS+CANDELS data over the CDF-S GOODS field, are used to measure UV
colors, expressed as the UV-continuum slope beta, of star-forming galaxies over
a wide range in luminosity (0.1L*(z=3) to 2L*(z=3)) at high redshift (z~7 to
z~4). Beta is measured using all ACS and WFC3/IR passbands uncontaminated by
Ly_alpha and spectral breaks. Extensive tests show that our beta measurements
are only subject to minimal biases. Using a different selection procedure,
Dunlop et al. recently found large biases in their beta measurements. To
reconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found that
beta measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the same
passbands are used both to select the sources and to measure beta.
High-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame UV color-magnitude (CM)
relationship that becomes systematically bluer towards fainter UV luminosities.
No evolution is seen in the slope of the UV CM relationship in the first 1.5
Gyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero-point to redder colors from
z~7 to z~4. This suggests that galaxies are evolving along a well-defined
sequence in the L(UV)-color (beta) plane (a ""star-forming sequence""?). Dust
appears to be the principal factor driving changes in the UV color (beta) with
luminosity. These new larger beta samples lead to improved dust extinction
estimates at z~4-7 and confirm that the extinction is still essentially zero at
low luminosities and high redshifts. Inclusion of the new dust extinction
results leads to (i) excellent agreement between the SFR density at z~4-8 and
that inferred from the stellar mass density, and (ii) to higher SSFRs at z>~4,
suggesting the SSFR may evolve modestly (by factors of ~2) from z~4-7 to z~2.

parameters for a total of 430 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), down to a
limiting surface brightness of 24.5 mag/arcsec^2. Light profiles were initially
fitted with a Sersic's R^(1/n) model, but we found that 205 (~48) BCGs require
a double component model to accurately match their light profiles. The best fit
for these 205 galaxies is an inner Sersic model, with indices n~1-7, plus an
outer exponential component.
  Thus, we establish the existence of two categories of the BCGs luminosity
profiles: single and double component profiles. We found that double profile
BCGs are brighter ~0.2 mag than single profile BCG. In fact, the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test applied to these subsamples indicates that they have
different total magnitude distributions, with mean values M_R=-23.8 +/- 0.6 mag
for single profile BCGs and M_R=-24.0 +/- 0.5 mag for double profile BCGs. We
find that partial luminosities for both subsamples are indistinguishable up to
r = 15 kpc, while for r > 20 kpc the luminosities we obtain are on average 0.2
mag brighter for double profile BCGs. This result indicates that extra-light
for double profile BCGs does not come from the inner region but from the outer
regions of these galaxies.
  The best fit slope of the Kormendy relation for the whole sample is a = 3.13
+/- 0.04$. However, when fitted separately, single and double profile BCGs show
different slopes: a_(single) = 3.29 +/- 0.06 and a_(double)= 2.79 +/- 0.08.
  On the other hand, we did not find differences between these two BCGs
categories when we compared global cluster properties such as the BCG-projected
position relative to the cluster X-ray center emission, X-ray luminosity, or
BCG orientation with respect to the cluster position angle.

increasing the range of environments where PAHs have been spectroscopically
detected in the SMC. We investigate the variations of the mid-IR bands in each
region and compare our results to studies of the PAH bands in the SINGS sample
and in a sample of low-metallicity starburst galaxies. PAH emission in the SMC
is characterized by low ratios of the 6-9 micron features relative to the 11.3
micron feature and weak 8.6 and 17.0 micron features. Interpreting these band
ratios in the light of laboratory and theoretical studies, we find that PAHs in
the SMC tend to be smaller and less ionized than those in higher metallicity
galaxies. Based on studies of PAH destruction, we argue that a size
distribution shifted towards smaller PAHs cannot be the result of processing in
the interstellar medium, but instead reflects differences in the formation of
PAHs at low metallicity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
observations for our understanding of the PAH life-cycle in low-metallicity
galaxies---namely that the observed deficit of PAHs may be a consequence of
PAHs forming with smaller average sizes and therefore being more susceptible to
destruction under typical interstellar medium conditions.

geometry. These may either connect freely falling ""satellites,"" or wrap
non-trivial cycles of geometries like the torus, and are also used in
diffeomorphism- invariant constructions of two-point functions of field
operators. For spacelike separations significantly exceeding the Hubble scale,
no spacetime geodesic connects two events, but one may find geodesics
constrained to lie within constant-time spatial slices. In inflationary
geometries, metric perturbations produce significant and growing corrections to
the lengths of such geodesics, as we show in both quantization on an inflating
torus and in standard slow-roll inflation. These become large, signaling
breakdown of a perturbative description of the geometry via such observables,
and consistent with perturbative instability of de Sitter space. In particular,
we show that the geodesic distance on constant time slices during inflation
becomes non-perturbative a few e-folds after a given scale has left the
horizon, by distances \sim 1/H^3 \sim RS, obstructing use of such geodesics in
constructing IR-safe observables based on the spatial geometry. We briefly

full entanglement spectrum through the R\'{e}nyi entropies. In this connection
we derive a simple formula that explicitly relates the eigenvalues of the
reduced density matrix to the R\'{e}nyi entropies of integer order for any
finite density matrix. In other systems, particularly in one dimension, the
fluctuations are in many ways similar but not equivalent to the entanglement
entropy. Fluctuations are tractable analytically, computable numerically in
both density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo calculations,

flat faint-end slope alpha in the FUV LF at z<1.7. At z>1.7, we set alpha
steepening with (1+z). The absolute magnitude M*_FUV brightens in the entire
range 0<z<4.5, and at z>2 it is on average brighter than in the literature,
while phi* is smaller. Our total LD shows a peak at z=2, present also when
considering all sources of uncertainty. The SFRD history peaks as well at z=2.
It rises by a factor of 6 during 2 Gyr (from z=4.5 to z=2), and then decreases
by a factor of 12 during 10 Gyr down to z=0.05. This peak is mainly produced by
a similar peak within the population of galaxies with -21.5<=M_FUV<=-19.5 mag.
As times goes by, the total SFRD is dominated by fainter and fainter galaxies.
The presence of a clear peak at z=2 and a fast rise at z>2 of the SFRD is
compelling for models of galaxy formation. The mean dust attenuation A_FUV of
the global galaxy population rises by 1 mag during 2 Gyr from z=4.5 to z=2,
reaches its maximum at z=1 (A_FUV=2.2 mag), and then decreases by 1.1 mag

emission of the Milky Way Galaxy. The model was developed to account for data
on external galaxies with sensitive HI data. For appropriate parameter values,
the model reproduces well the HI emission observed at Intermediate Velocities.
The optimal parameters imply that cool gas is ionised as it is blasted out of
the disc, but becomes neutral when its vertical velocity has been reduced by
~30 per cent. The parameters also imply that cooling of coronal gas in the
wakes of fountain clouds transfers gas from the virial-temperature corona to
the disc at ~2 Mo/yr. This rate agrees, to within the uncertainties with the
accretion rate required to sustain the Galaxy's star formation without
depleting the supply of interstellar gas. We predict the radial profile of
accretion, which is an important input for models of Galactic chemical
evolution. The parameter values required for the model to fit the Galaxy's HI
data are in excellent agreement with values estimated from external galaxies
and hydrodynamical studies of cloud-corona interaction. Our model does not
reproduce the observed HI emission at High Velocities, consistent with High
Velocity Clouds being extragalactic in origin. If our model is correct, the
structure of the Galaxy's outer HI disc differs materially from that used
previously to infer the distribution of dark matter on the Galaxy's outskirts.

on average 323 contacts per day with 47 other children, leading to an average
daily interaction time of 176 minutes. Most contacts are brief, but long
contacts are also observed. Contacts occur mostly within each class, and each
child spends on average three times more time in contact with classmates than
with children of other classes. We describe the temporal evolution of the
contact network and the trajectories followed by the children in the school,
which constrain the contact patterns. We determine an exposure matrix aimed at
informing mathematical models. This matrix exhibits a class and age structure

  The observed properties of the contact patterns between school children are
relevant for modeling the propagation of diseases and for evaluating control

described by the same density operator are indistinguishable. For example,
unpolarized light can be obtained either by an incoherent mixture of two
orthogonal pure states or by tracing out a photon from a maximally
polarization-entangled photon pair. In both cases, one is unable to guess with
probability greater than 50% the outcome of any polarization measurement, but
the reasons are conceptually different: whereas the first case is a matter of
classical ignorance (the photons were prepared in a definite but unknown way),
the second one is of the quantum ignorance kind - if one cannot access the
other degrees of freedom of the quantum state, there is no information that
could be used to predict a measurement result. We use these concepts to discuss
the quantum-physical interpretation of partially polarized light from the point
of view of quantum communication and whether a polarization scrambler can
really depolarize light. A novel definition of the degree of polarization of a
single photon which does not depend on classical ignorance is also provided.

Defects and dopants create conduction in thermoelectric applications. However,

Magnetic impurities such as iron open a band gap at the Dirac point on the

applications, a good understanding of their properties is needed. In this

performance of secondary unlicensed users (SUs). However, the performance of
collaborative sensing is vulnerable to sensing data falsification attacks,
where malicious SUs (attackers) submit manipulated sensing reports to mislead
the fusion center's decision on spectrum occupancy. Moreover, attackers may not
follow the fusion center's decision regarding their spectrum access. This paper
considers a challenging attack scenario where multiple rational attackers
overhear all honest SUs' sensing reports and cooperatively maximize attackers'
aggregate spectrum utilization. We show that, without attack-prevention
mechanisms, honest SUs are unable to transmit over the licensed spectrum, and
they may further be penalized by the primary user for collisions due to
attackers' aggressive transmissions. To prevent such attacks, we propose two
novel attack-prevention mechanisms with direct and indirect punishments. The
key idea is to identify collisions to the primary user that should not happen
if all SUs follow the fusion center's decision. Unlike prior work, the proposed
simple mechanisms do not require the fusion center to identify and exclude
attackers. The direct punishment can effectively prevent all attackers from
behaving maliciously. The indirect punishment is easier to implement and can
prevent attacks when the attackers care enough about their long-term reward.

calculate its thermodynamical parameters. Integrations within the range $k\in

functions at zero temperature satisfy the third law of thermodynamics. It is
due to an anomalous term added to the pressure. This approach seems to be
correct, however, exact analysis shows that the entropy may become negative at
finite temperature. The only right choice is to perform integration within the
range $k\in (0,\infty) $, taking extended distribution function $f_\epsilon =1$

Through numerical simulations of the NLSE using fourth-order Runge-Kutta, we
confirm that our scheme shows the desired fourth-order accuracy. A computation
and storage requirement comparison is made between the 2SHOC scheme and the
non-compact equivalent scheme for both the Laplacian operator alone, as well as
when implemented in the NLSE simulations. Stability bounds are also shown in

quantitative sciences. In astronomy, the increasing scale of current and future
surveys is driving a trend towards a separation of the processes of low-level
data reduction and higher-level scientific analysis. Algorithms and software
responsible for the former are becoming increasingly complex, and at the same
time more general - measurements will be used for a wide variety of scientific
studies, and many of these cannot be anticipated in advance. On the other hand,
increased sample sizes and the corresponding decrease in stochastic uncertainty
puts greater importance on controlling systematic errors, which must happen for
the most part at the lowest levels of data analysis. Astronomical measurement
algorithms must improve in their handling of uncertainties as well, and hence
must be designed with detailed knowledge of the requirements of different
science goals. In this thesis, we advocate a Bayesian approach to survey data
reduction as a whole, and focus specifically on the problem of modeling
individual galaxies and stars. We present a Monte Carlo algorithm that can
efficiently sample from the posterior probability for a flexible class of
galaxy models, and propose a method for constructing and convolving these
models using Gauss-Hermite (""shapelet"") functions. These methods are designed
to be efficient in a multi-epoch modeling (""multifit"") sense, in which we
compare a generative model to each exposure rather than combining the data from
multiple exposures in advance. We also discuss how these methods are important
for specific higher-level analyses - particularly weak gravitational lensing -

twisted by photospheric footpoint motion that is assumed to depend on only one
coordinate ($x$) transverse to the initial magnetic field. The geometric
constraints imposed by our assumption precludes the occurrence of reconnection
and secondary instabilities, but enables us to follow for long times the
dissipation of energy due to the effects of resistivity and viscosity. In this
limit, we demonstrate that when the coherence time of random photospheric
footpoint motion is much smaller by several orders of magnitude compared with
the resistive diffusion time, the heating due to Ohmic and viscous dissipation
becomes independent of the resistivity of the plasma. Furthermore, we obtain
scaling relations that suggest that even if reconnection and/or secondary

the overall heating rate will still be independent of the resistivity.

order susceptibility. A signature at this lower transition, as a spontaneous
ferromagnetic signal, also appears in low field DC magnetization measurements.
A similar but larger ferromagnetic response appears at T~35 K. Both these
ferromagnetic signatures are suppressed in a small field (B ~ 40 Gauss

sources of continuous-wave gravitational radiation and are currently the
targets of directed searches with long-baseline detectors like the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). In this paper, previous
ideal-magnetohydrodynamic models of isothermal mountains are generalized to a
range of physically motivated, adiabatic equations of state. It is found that
the mass ellipticity drops substantially, from \epsilon ~ 3e-4 (isothermal) to
\epsilon ~ 9e-7 (non-relativistic degenerate neutrons), 6e-8 (relativistic
degenerate electrons) and 1e-8 (non-relativistic degenerate electrons)
(assuming a magnetic field of 3e12 G at birth). The characteristic mass M_{c}
at which the magnetic dipole moment halves from its initial value is also
modified, from M_{c}/M_{\sun} ~ 5e-4 (isothermal) to M_{c}/M_{\sun} ~ 2e-6,
1e-7, and 3e-8 for the above three equations of state, respectively. Similar
results are obtained for a realistic, piecewise-polytropic nuclear equation of
state. The adiabatic models are consistent with current LIGO upper limits,
unlike the isothermal models. Updated estimates of gravitational-wave
detectability are made. Monte Carlo simulations of the spin distribution of
accreting millisecond pulsars including gravitational-wave stalling agree
better with observations for certain adiabatic equations of state, implying
that X-ray spin measurements can probe the equation of state when coupled with
magnetic mountain models.

solution to this problem and provides the following contributions: 1) A
closed-form lower bound of average mutual information is derived. It achieves
asymptotic optimality at low and high signal-to-noise ratio regions and, with a
constant shift, offers an accurate approximation to the average mutual
information; 2) The optimal structure of the precoder is revealed, and a
unified two-step iterative algorithm is proposed to solve this problem.
Numerical examples show the convergence and the efficacy of the proposed
algorithm. Compared to its conventional counterparts, the proposed linear
precoding method provides a significant performance gain.

Yan; STOC'11] for combinatorial auctions that is truthful in expectation and
guarantees a (1-1/e)-approximation to the optimal social welfare when players
have coverage valuations. This approximation ratio is the best possible even
for non-truthful algorithms, assuming $P \neq NP$. Given the recent sequence of
negative results for combinatorial auctions under more restrictive notions of
incentive compatibility, this development raises a natural question: Are
truthful-in-expectation mechanisms compatible with polynomial-time
approximation in a way that deterministic or universally truthful mechanisms
are not? In particular, can polynomial-time truthful-in-expectation mechanisms
guarantee a near-optimal approximation ratio for more general variants of
combinatorial auctions?
  We prove that this is not the case. Specifically, the result of Dughmi,
Roughgarden and Yan cannot be extended to combinatorial auctions with
submodular valuations in the value oracle model. (Absent strategic
considerations, a (1-1/e)-approximation is still achievable in this setting.)
More precisely, we prove that there is a constant \gamma>0 such that there is
no randomized mechanism that is truthful-in-expectation--- or even
approximately truthful-in-expectation --- and guarantees an
m^{-\gamma}-approximation to the optimal social welfare for combinatorial
auctions with submodular valuations in the value oracle model. We also prove an
analogous result for the flexible combinatorial public projects (CPP) problem.
Both our results present an unexpected separation between coverage functions
and submodular functions, which does not occur for these problems without
strategic considerations.

partial differential equations (PDEs). However, designing PDE system usually
requires high mathematical skills and good insight into the problems. In this
paper, we consider designing PDEs for various problems arising in computer
vision and image processing in a lazy manner: \emph{learning PDEs from real
data via data-based optimal control}. We first propose a general intelligent
PDE system which holds the basic translational and rotational invariance rule
for most vision problems. By introducing a PDE-constrained optimal control
framework, it is possible to use the training data resulting from multiple ways
(ground truth, results from other methods, and manual results from humans) to
learn PDEs for different computer vision tasks. The proposed optimal control
based training framework aims at learning a PDE-based regressor to approximate
the unknown (and usually nonlinear) mapping of different vision tasks. The
experimental results show that the learnt PDEs can solve different vision
problems reasonably well. In particular, we can obtain PDEs not only for
problems that traditional PDEs work well but also for problems that PDE-based
methods have never been tried before, due to the difficulty in describing those
problems in a mathematical way.

demand for literature retrieval services has been steadily increased. One of
the most popular retrieval services is to find a set of papers similar to the
paper under consideration, which requires a measure that computes similarities
between papers. Scientific literature databases exhibit two interesting
characteristics that are different from general databases. First, the papers
cited by old papers are often not included in the database due to technical and
economic reasons. Second, since a paper references the papers published before
it, few papers cite recently-published papers. These two characteristics cause
all existing similarity measures to fail in at least one of the following
cases: (1) measuring the similarity between old, but similar papers, (2)
measuring the similarity between recent, but similar papers, and (3) measuring
the similarity between two similar papers: one old, the other recent. In this
paper, we propose a new link-based similarity measure called C-Rank, which uses
both in-link and out-link by disregarding the direction of references. In
addition, we discuss the most suitable normalization method for scientific
literature databases and propose an evaluation method for measuring the
accuracy of similarity measures. We have used a database with real-world papers
from DBLP and their reference information crawled from Libra for experiments
and compared the performance of C-Rank with those of existing similarity
measures. Experimental results show that C-Rank achieves a higher accuracy than

corrected turn off magnitude is converted to age, which represents the LSFE in
a region. The spatial map of the LSFE age shows that the star formation has
shrunk to the central regions in the last 100Myr in both the galaxies. The
location and age of LSFE is found to correlate well with those of the star

young star formation. We detect peaks of star formation at 0-10, 90-100Myr in
the LMC, and 0-10, 50- 60Myr in the SMC. The quenching of star formation in the
LMC is found to be asymmetric with respect to the optical center such that most
of the young star forming regions are located to the north and east. On
deprojecting the data on the LMC plane, the recent star formation appears to be
stretched in the north-east direction and the HI gas is found to be distributed
preferentially in the North. The centroid is found to shift to north in
200-40Myr, and to north-east in the last 40Myr. In the SMC, we detect a shift
in centroid of population of 500-40Myr in the direction of the LMC. We propose
that the HI gas in the LMC is pulled to the north of the LMC in the last 200Myr
due to the gravitational attraction of our Galaxy at the time of perigalactic
passage. The shifted HI gas is preferentially compressed in the north during
200-40Myr and in the north-east in the last 40Myr, due to the motion of the LMC
in the Galactic halo. The recent star formation in the SMC is due to the
combined gravitational effect of the LMC and the perigalactic passage.

(iv) Analysis of extracted texture features by classifier. A wavelet based
statistical texture feature set is derived from normal and tumor regions.
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select the optimal texture features from the
set of extracted texture features. We construct the Support Vector Machine
(SVM) based classifier and evaluate the performance of classifier by comparing
the classification results of the SVM based classifier with the Back

using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Experimental results
show that the classification accuracy of SVM is 96% for 10 fold cross

  Covariates Interacted with Random Assignment as Instrumental Variables",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In randomized trials, researchers are often interested in mediation analysis
to understand how a treatment works, in particular how much of a treatment's
effect is mediated by an intermediated variable and how much the treatment
directly affects the outcome not through the mediator. The standard regression
approach to mediation analysis assumes sequential ignorability of the mediator,
that is that the mediator is effectively randomly assigned given baseline
covariates and the randomized treatment. Since the experiment does not
randomize the mediator, sequential ignorability is often not plausible. Ten
Have et al. (2007, Biometrics), Dunn and Bentall (2007, Statistics in Medicine)
and Albert (2008, Statistics in Medicine) presented methods that use baseline
covariates interacted with random assignment as instrumental variables, and do
not require sequential ignorability. We make two contributions to this
approach. First, in previous work on the instrumental variable approach, it has
been assumed that the direct effect of treatment and the effect of the mediator
are constant across subjects; we allow for variation in effects across subjects
and show what assumptions are needed to obtain consistent estimates for this
setting. Second, we develop a method of sensitivity analysis for violations of
the key assumption that the direct effect of the treatment and the effect of
the mediator do not depend on the baseline covariates.

explain the absence of the magnetic order in the selenide compound as resulting

central source is a compact star that has high effective temperature, and it is
consistent with the cooling without exotic phases. The observation also gives
the mass range of $M \geqslant 1.5 M_\odot$, which may conflict with the
current plausible cooling scenario of compact stars. There are some cooled
compact stars such as Vela or 3C58, which can be barely explained by the
minimal cooling scenario, which includes the neutrino emission by nucleon
superfluidity (PBF). Therefore, we invoke the exotic cooling processes, where a
heavier star cools faster than lighter one. However, the scenario seems to be
inconsistent with the observation of Cas A. Therefore, we present a new cooling
scenario to explain the observation of Cas A by constructing models that
include a quark color superconducting (CSC) phase with a large energy gap; this
phase appears at ultrahigh density region and reduces neutrino emissivity. In
our model, a compact star has CSC quark core with a low neutrino emissivity
surrounded by high emissivity region made by normal quarks. We present cooling
curves obtained from the evolutionary calculations of compact stars: while
heavier stars cool slowly, and lighter ones indicate the opposite tendency
without considering nucleon superfluidity. Furthermore, we show that our
scenario is consistent with the recent observations of the effective

existing BV photometry. The analysis of the three eclipsing binaries clearly
supports the larger values of the distance, around 8 kpc, and rules out values
of about 2.4 - 2.8 kpc that have been suggested in the literature. Furthermore,
our spectroscopic monitoring reveals no clear signature of binarity with
periods shorter than 50 days in either the WN6ha star WR 20b, the early O-type
stars MSP 18, MSP 171, MSP 182, MSP 183, MSP 199, and MSP 203, or three
previously unknown mid O-type stars. The only newly identified candidate binary
system is MSP 167. The absence of a binary signature is especially surprising
for WR 20b and MSP 18, which were previously found to be bright X-ray sources.
The distance of Westerlund 2 is confirmed to be around 8 kpc as previously
suggested based on the spectrophotometry of its population of O-type stars and
the analysis of the light curve of WR 20a. Our results suggest that
short-period binary systems are not likely to be common, at least not among the

parabolic, spherical and parabolic ones. Transition from vector to spinor

of massive binaries. These phenomena (such as the Struve--Sahade effect,
difficulties to determine properly the spectral type,...) have been reported
and documented in the literature. Aims: We simulate the spectra of circular
massive binaries at different phases of the orbital cycle and accounting for
the gravitational influence of the companion star on the shape and physical
properties of the stellar surface. Methods: We use the Roche potential to
compute the stellar surface, von Zeipel theorem and reflection effects to
compute the surface temperature. We then interpolate in a grid of NLTE
plan-parallel atmosphere model spectra to obtain the local spectrum at each
surface point. We finally sum all the contributions (accounting for the Doppler
shift, limb-darkening, ...) to obtain the total spectrum. The computation is
done for different orbital phases and for different sets of physical and
orbital parameters. Results: Our first models reproduce the Struve--Sahade
effect for several lines. Another effect, surface temperature distribution is
visible but the distribution predicted by our current model is not yet
consistent with observations. Conclusions: In some cases, the Struve--Sahade
effect as well as more complex line intensity variations could be linked to
blends of intrinsically asymmetric line profiles that are not appropriatly
treated by the deblending routine. Systematic variations of lines for (nearly)
contact systems are also predicted by the model.

CP-violating New-Physics contributions to $B^0_s$--$\bar B^0_s$ mixing. As the
hadronic structure of the $f_0(980)$ has not yet been settled, we take a
critical look at the implications for the relevant observables and address
recent experimental data. It turns out that the effective lifetime of $B^0_s\to

respect to hadronic effects and thereby allow us to search for a large
CP-violating $B^0_s$--$\bar B^0_s$ mixing phase $\phi_s$, which is tiny in the
Standard Model. However, should small CP violation, i.e. in the range
$-0.1\lsim S\lsim 0$, be found in $B^0_s\to J/\psi f_0(980)$, it will be
crucial to constrain hadronic corrections in order to distinguish possible
New-Physics effects from the Standard Model. We point out that $B^0_d\to J/\psi

the 3/2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Its eccentricity distribution
evolves mostly due to the Yarkovsky/YORP effect and assuming that: (i) impact
disruption was isotropic, and (ii) albedo distribution of small asteroids is
the same as for large ones, we can estimate the age of the Hilda family to be
$4_{-1}^{+0}\,{\rm Gyr}$. We also calculate collisional activity in the J3/2
region. Our results indicate that current collisional rates are very low for a
200\,km parent body such that the number of expected events over Gyrs is much
smaller than one.
  The large age and the low probability of the collisional disruption lead us
to the conclusion that the Hilda family might have been created during the Late
Heavy Bombardment when the collisions were much more frequent. The Hilda family
may thus serve as a test of orbital behavior of planets during the LHB. We
tested the influence of the giant-planet migration on the distribution of the
family members. The scenarios that are consistent with the observed Hilda
family are those with fast migration time scales $\simeq 0.3\,{\rm Myr}$ to
$3\,{\rm Myr}$, because longer time scales produce a family that is depleted
and too much spread in eccentricity. Moreover, there is an indication that
Jupiter and Saturn were no longer in a compact configuration (with period ratio
$P_{\rm S}/P_{\rm J} > 2.09$) at the time when the Hilda family was created.

relative to the nucleus, suggesting an inflow with Mdot<~12 Msun yr^{-1}. Both
galaxies have warm (Tdust>~100 K) nuclear continuum components, together with a
more extended component that is much more prominent and massive in Arp220. A
chemical dichotomy is found in both sources: on the one hand, the nuclear
regions have high H2O abundances, ~10^{-5}, and high HCN/H2O and HCN/NH3 column
density ratios of 0.1-0.4 and 2-5, respectively, indicating a chemistry typical
of evolved hot cores where grain mantle evaporation has occurred. On the other
hand, the high OH abundance, with OH/H2O ratios of ~0.5, indicates the effects
of X-rays and/or cosmic rays. The nuclear media have surface brightnesses
>~10^{13} Lsun/kpc^2 and are estimated to be thick (N_H>~10^{25} cm^{-2}).
While NGC4418 shows weak absorption in H2^{18}O and ^{18}OH, with a

the separate free energy of each phase as a function of temperature. Thus, for
a given pressure, the coexistence temperature was obtained by the condition of
equal free energy of coexisting phases. The free energy was calculated by using
non-equilibrium techniques such as adiabatic switching and reversible scaling.
The phase diagram obtained by classical Monte Carlo simulations has been
compared to that obtained by quantum path-integral simulations. Quantum effects
related to the finite mass of neon cause that coexistence lines are shifted
towards lower temperatures when compared to the classical limit. The shift
found in the triple point amounts to 1.5 K, i.e., about 6 % of the triple-point
temperature. The triple-point isotope effect has been determined for 20Ne,
21Ne, 22Ne, and natural neon. The simulation data show satisfactory agreement

attention on by image processing scientists since late 80s. Consequently, since
now many different methods have been proposed to solve this problem. In most of
these methods the researchers attempted to describe and discriminate textures
based on linear and non-linear patterns. The linear and non-linear patterns on
any window are based on formation of Grain Components in a particular order.
Grain component is a primitive unit of morphology that most meaningful
information often appears in the form of occurrence of that. The approach which
is proposed in this paper could analyze the texture based on its grain
components and then by making grain components histogram and extracting
statistical features from that would classify the textures. Finally, to
increase the accuracy of classification, proposed approach is expanded to color
images to utilize the ability of approach in analyzing each RGB channels,
individually. Although, this approach is a general one and it could be used in
different applications, the method has been tested on the stone texture and the
results can prove the quality of approach.

hydrogen, but a significant amount of neutral helium may also be present in the
plasma with a particular temperature. Damping of MHD waves due to ion collision
with neutral hydrogen is well studied, but the effects of neutral helium are
largely unknown. We aim to study the effect of neutral helium in the damping of
Alfven waves in solar partially ionized plasmas. We consider three-fluid
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation, where one component is
electron-proton-singly ionized helium and other two components are the neutral
hydrogen and neutral helium atoms. We derive the dispersion relation of linear
Alfven waves in isothermal and homogeneous plasma. Then we solve the dispersion
relation and derive the damping rates of Alfven waves for different plasma
parameters. The presence of neutral helium significantly enhances the damping
of Alfven waves compared to the damping due to neutral hydrogen at certain
values of plasma temperature (10000-40000 K) and ionization. Damping rates have
a peak near the ion-neutral collision frequency, but decrease for the higher
part of wave spectrum. Collision of ions with neutral helium atoms can be of
importance for the damping of Alfven waves in chromospheric spicules and in

Employing an individual-based model, we reproduce experimental findings.
Moreover, crowding is identified as the key regulatory mechanism of
depolymerization dynamics. Our analysis gives two qualitatively distinct
regimes. For motor densities above a particular threshold, a macroscopic
traffic jam emerges at the plus-end and the MT dynamics become independent of
the motor concentration. Below this threshold, microscopic traffic jams at the
tip arise which cancel out the effect of the depolymerization kinetics such
that the depolymerization speed is solely determined by the motor density.
Because this density changes over the MT length, length-dependent regulation is
possible. Remarkably, motor cooperativity does not affect the depolymerization
speed but only the end-residence time of depolymerases.

human shapes, from which statistical shape models can be built. These
statistical models represent prior knowledge of the human shape and enable us
to solve shape reconstruction problems from partial information. Generating
human shape from traditional anthropometric measurements is such a problem,
since these 1-D measurements encode 3-D shape information. Combined with a
statistical shape model, these easy-to-obtain measurements can be leveraged to
create 3D human shapes. However, existing methods limit the creation of the
shapes to the space spanned by the database and thus require a large amount of
training data. In this paper, we introduce a technique that extrapolates the
statistically inferred shape to fit the measurement data using nonlinear
optimization. This method ensures that the generated shape is both human-like
and satisfies the measurement conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the method and compare it to existing approaches through extensive experiments,
using both synthetic data and real human measurements.

investigate the nucleosynthesis processes occurring in AGB stars, when these

this paper we present the database dedicated to the nucleosynthesis of AGB
stars: the FRUITY (FRANEC Repository of Updated Isotopic Tables & Yields)
database. An interactive web-based interface allows users to freely download
the full (from H to Bi) isotopic composition, as it changes after each third
dredge-up episode and the stellar yields the models produce. A first set of AGB
models, having masses in the range 1.5 < M/Msun < 3.0 and metallicities 1e-3 <
Z < 2e-2, is discussed here. For each model, a detailed description of the
physical and the chemical evolution is provided. In particular, we illustrate
the details of the s-process and we evaluate the theoretical uncertainties due
to the parametrization adopted to model convection and mass loss. The resulting
nucleosynthesis scenario is checked by comparing the theoretical [hs/ls] and
[Pb/hs] ratios to those obtained from the available abundance analysis of
s-enhanced stars. On the average, the variation with the metallicity of these
spectroscopic indexes is well reproduced by theoretical models, although the
predicted spread at a given metallicity is substantially smaller than the
observed one. Possible explanations for such a difference are briefly
discussed. An independent check of the third dredge-up efficiency is provided
by the C-stars luminosity function. Consequently, theoretical C-stars
luminosity functions for the Galactic disk and the Magellanic Clouds have been
derived. We generally find a good agreement with observations.

models (in their full generality) by means of `quasi-local' scalar variables
constructed by suitable integral distributions that can be interpreted as
weighed proper volume averages of the local covariant scalars. In terms of
these variables, the field equations and basic physical and geometric
quantities are formally identical to their corresponding expressions in the
spherically symmetric LTB dust models. Since we can map every Szekeres model to
a unique LTB model, rigorous results valid for the latter models can be readily
generalized to a non-spherical Szekeres geometry. The new variables lead
naturally to an initial value formulation in which all scalars are expressed as
scaling laws in terms of their values at an arbitrary initial space slice.
These variables also yield a significant simplification of numerical work,
since the fluid flow evolution equations become a system of autonomous ordinary
differential equations subjected to algebraic constraints containing the
information on the deviations from spherical symmetry. As an example of how
this formalism can be applied, we show that spherical symmetry is stable
against small dipole-like perturbations. This new approach to the dynamics of
the Szekeres solutions has an enormous potential for dealing with a wide
variety of theoretical issues and for constructing non-spherical models of
cosmological inhomogeneities to fit observational data.

evolution of the central density as well as the baryon chemical potential of
accreting neutron stars. We compared the thin-disk accretion with and without
the magnetic field torque with the spin-down scenario for a selection of recent
equations of state. We compared the prevalent (in the recycled-pulsar context)
Keplerian thin-disk model, in which the matter is accreted from the
marginally-stable circular orbit, with the recent magnetic-torque model that
takes into account the influence of stellar magnetic field on the effective
inner boundary of the disk. Calculations were performed using a multi-domain
spectral methods code in the framework of General Relativity. We considered
three equations of state consistent with the recently measured mass of PSR
J1614-2230, 1.97 +- 0.04 M_sun (one of them softened by the appearance of
hyperons). If there is no magnetic torque and efficient angular momentum
transfer from the disk to the star, substantial central compression is limited
to the region of initial stellar masses close to the maximum mass. Outside the
maximum mass vicinity, accretion-induced central compression is significant
only if the angular momentum transfer is inefficient. Accounting for the
magnetic field effectively decreases the efficiency of angular momentum
transfer and implies a significant central compression. An efficient angular
momentum transfer from a thin disk onto a non-magnetized neutron star does not
provide a good mechanism for the central compression and possible phase
transition. Substantial central compression is possible for a broad range of
masses of slowly-rotating initial configurations for magnetized neutron stars.
Accretion-induced central compression is particularly strong for stiff equation
of state with a high-density softening.

Galerkin-type numerical methods such as finite element methods, spectral
methods, and discontinuous Galerkin methods, a task which has not been
practicable in the past. The crux of the vanishing moment method is the simple
idea of approximating a fully nonlinear second order PDE by a family
(parametrized by a small parameter $\vepsi$) of quasilinear higher order (in
particular, fourth order) PDEs. The primary objectives of this book are to
present a detailed convergent analysis for the method in the radial symmetric
case and to carry out a comprehensive finite element numerical analysis for the
vanishing moment equations (i.e., the regularized fourth order PDEs). Abstract
methodological and convergence analysis frameworks of conforming finite element
methods and mixed finite element methods are first developed for fully
nonlinear second order PDEs in general settings. The abstract frameworks are
then applied to three prototypical nonlinear equations, namely, the
Monge-Amp\`ere equation, the equation of prescribed Gauss curvature, and the
infinity-Laplacian equation. Numerical experiments are also presented for each
problem to validate the theoretical error estimate results and to gauge the
efficiency of the proposed numerical methods and the vanishing moment
methodology.

the mode frequencies over nine radial orders and pointed out some unusual
characteristics: there exist some modes outside the identified ridges in the
echelle diagram and the curvature of the l=1 ridge significantly differs from
that of the l=0 ridge. We here propose a toy-model to describe avoided
crossings with a strong coupling between the p-mode and g-mode cavities and we
show that the peculiar features of the oscillation spectrum of HD49385 can be
accounted for only by a low-frequency l=1 avoided crossing. This leads us to
establish the post-main-sequence status of HD49385. We then investigate the
information which is brought by the mixed modes about the structure of the
core. Having shown that traditional optimization techniques are ill-suited for
stars with mixed modes in avoided crossing, we propose a new approach to the
computation of grids of models, which we apply to HD49385. As a result, we show
that the amount of core overshooting in HD49385 is either very low
(0<alpha_ov<0.05) or moderate (0.18<alpha_ov<0.20). The mixing length parameter
is found to be significantly lower than the solar one (alpha_CGM=0.55\pm0.04
compared to the solar calibrated value alpha_sun=0.64). We also find that the
revised solar abundances of Asplund give a better agreement than the classical
ones of Grevesse & Noels. Finally, we show that the strength of the coupling
between the cavities, which can be estimated through the properties of the
observed avoided crossing, plays a dominant role in constraining the parameters
of the models. At each step, we investigate the origin and meaning of our
seismic diagnostics in terms of the physical structure of the star.

hot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, and
descends back into the interior at the edges of granules. This is the visible
manifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solar
convection zone. Because red giants have deeper convection zones and more
extended atmospheres than the Sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulation
in red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. Until now, neither
observations nor 1D analytical convection models could put constraints on
granulation in red giants. However, thanks to asteroseismology, this study can
now be performed. The resulting parameters yield physical information about the
granulation. We analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by Kepler
during 13 months. We fit the power spectra with Harvey-like profiles to
retrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and power
P_gran). We also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into account
that different slopes are used in the Harvey functions. We search for a
correlation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter
(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters
(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (T_eff)). We
show that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and P_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistent
with the theoretical predictions. We find that the granulation time scales of
stars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales of
stars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. Finally, we show
that realistic 3D simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the
(T_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the Kepler observations
well in terms of trends.

region of highly ionized gas with a size of few up to 15-20 kpc. When it shows
a conical or bi-conical shape with the apexes pointing towards the active

an evidence of the Unified Model that predicts an anisotropic escape of
ionizing photons from the nucleus confined to a cone by a dusty torus. Many
details about the complex structure of the ENLR still remain unveiled, as for
example the origin of the ionized gas. Here we present new results of a study
of the physical and kinematical properties of the circumnuclear gas in the
nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7212. Medium and high resolution integral field
spectra and broad-band photometric data were collected and analysed in the
frame of an observational campaign of nearby Seyfert galaxies, aiming to handle
the complicated issue of the origin of the gas in the ENLR. This work is based
on: (i) analysis of gas physical properties (density, temperature and
metallicity), (ii) analysis of emission line ratios, and (iii) study of
kinematics of gas and stars. By reconstructing the [O III]/Hbeta ionization
map, we pointed out for the first time the presence of an ionization cone
extended up to about 6 kpc, made by a large amount of low metallicity gas,
kinematically disturbed and decoupled from stars, whose highly ionized
component shows radial motions at multiple velocities proved by the complex
profiles of the specral lines. Since NGC 7212 is a strongly interacting triple
galaxy system, the gravitational effects are likely to be at the origin of the
ENLR in this Seyfert galaxy.

dense core bolometric luminosity of 0.05 Lsun is obtained. By modeling the
broadband SED and the continuum interferometric visibilities simultaneously, we
confirm that a central source of heating is needed to explain the observations.
This modeling also shows that the data can be well fitted by a dense core with
a YSO and disk, or by a dense core with a central First Hydrostatic Core
(FHSC). Unfortunately, we are not able to decide between these two models,
which produce similar fits. We also detect 12CO(2-1) emission with red- and
blue-shifted emission suggesting the presence of a slow and poorly collimated
outflow, in opposition to what is usually found towards young stellar objects
but in agreement with prediction from simulations of a FHSC. This presents the
best candidate, so far, for a FHSC, an object that has been identified in

124 of the 151 candidates follow the previously known infrared photometric
sequence of the cluster and are probably members. We have studied the spatial
distribution of these candidates and found that there are objects located at
distances greater than 30 arcmin to the north and west of Sigma Orionis that
probably belong to different populations of the Orion's Belt. For the 102 bona

density can be represented by a decreasing exponential function (sigma =

statistical comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that the
spatial distribution of the cluster member candidates is compatible with a
Poissonian distribution and, hence, they are not mainly forming aggregations or
sub-clustering. Using near-infrared JHK-band data from 2MASS and UKIDSS and
mid-infrared data from IRAC/Spitzer, we find that 5-9 % of the brown dwarf
candidates in the Sigma Orionis cluster have K-band excesses and 31+/-7 % of
them show mid-infrared excesses at wavelengths longer than 5.8 microns, which
are probably related to the presence of disks. We have also calculated the
initial mass spectrum (dN/dm) of Sigma Orionis from very low mass stars (0.10
Msol) to the deuterium-burning mass limit (0.012-0.013 Msol). This is a rising
function toward lower masses and can be represented by a power-law distribution
(dN/dm = m^{-alpha}) with an exponent alpha of 0.7+/-0.3 for an age of 3 Myr.

to be more resilient to contagion triggered by the failure of a random bank,
but more fragile with respect to contagion triggered by the failure of highly

induce an inefficient diversification that makes the system more prone to
contagion events. A targeted policy aimed at reinforcing the stability of the
biggest banks is shown to improve the stability of the system in the regime of
high average degree. Finally, disassortative mixing, such as that observed in

linearly representable matroids can be viewed as having representations via
matrices with only one row, we conclude this paper by an investigation of
representations via matrices with only two rows.

formation is possible inside the inner parsec of the Milky Way. Here we suggest
that giant planets, solid terrestrial-like planets, comets and asteroids may
also form in these environments, and that this may have observational
implications for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Like in debris discs around main
sequence stars, collisions of large solid objects should initiate strong
fragmentation cascades. The smallest particles in such a cascade - the
microscopic dust - may provide a significant opacity. We put a number of
observational and physical constraints on AGN obscuring torii resulting from
such fragmentation cascades. We find that torii fed by fragmenting asteroids
disappear at both low and high AGN luminosities. At high luminosities, $L \sim
L_{\rm Edd}$, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington limit, the AGN radiation
pressure blows out the microscopic dust too rapidly. At low luminosities, on
the other hand, the AGN discs may avoid gravitational fragmentation into stars
and solids. We also note that these fragmentation cascades may be responsible
for astrophysically ""large"" dust particles of approximately micrometer sizes
that were postulated by some authors to explain unusual absorption properties
of the AGN torii.

suggested. Relation between symmetry based predictions and direct calculation
has been shown. It was shown, that electric dipole moment of the vortex is
located inside the small vortex core. The antivortices and antiskyrmions do not
carry the total core electric dipole induced by the flexomagnetoelectric
interaction in the hexoctahedral cubic crystal. The volumetric bound electric
charge is distributed around the core. Switching of the core electric dipole
direction produces the switching of the core magnetization or vortex chirality
and vice versa. The vortices and skyrmions with time-invariant enantiomorphism
have two degenerative states: clockwise and counterclockwise state.

movements and also with voice commands. Our system is a multimodal interface
concerned with controlling the computer. The selected modes of interaction are
speech and gestures. We are seeing the revolutionary of computers and
information technologies into daily practice. Healthy people use keyboard,
mouse, trackball, or touchpad for controlling the PC. However these peripheries
are usually not suitable for handicapped people. They may have problems using
these standard peripheries, for example when they suffer from myopathy, or
cannot move their hands after an injury. Our system has been developed to
provide computer access for people with severe disabilities. This system tracks
the computer user's Head movements with a video camera and translates them into
the movements of the mouse pointer on the screen and the voice as button
presses. Therefore we are coming with a proposal system that can be used with
handicapped people to control the PC.

time series into graphs and allows the possibility of studying dynamical
systems through the characterization of their associated networks. This method
leads to a natural graph-theoretical description of nonlinear systems with
qualities in the spirit of symbolic dynamics. We support our claim via the case
study of the period-doubling and band-splitting attractor cascades that
characterize unimodal maps. We provide a universal analytical description of
this classic scenario in terms of the horizontal visibility graphs associated
with the dynamics within the attractors, that we call Feigenbaum graphs,
independent of map nonlinearity or other particulars. We derive exact results
for their degree distribution and related quantities, recast them in the
context of the renormalization group and find that its fixed points coincide
with those of network entropy optimization. Furthermore, we show that the
network entropy mimics the Lyapunov exponent of the map independently of its
sign, hinting at a Pesin-like relation equally valid out of chaos.

powder x-ray diffractometry confirms a zincblende cubic structure, with
additional satellite peaks observed near the (111) Bragg line. This suggests
the presence of ordered vacancy planes along the [111] direction that have been
previously observed in Ga2Te3. Defect studies via positron annihilation
spectroscopy show an average positron lifetime of ~400 ps in bulk as-grown
specimens. Such a large lifetime suggests that the positron annihilation sites
in these materials are dominated by defects. Moreover, analyzing the electron
momenta via coincidence Doppler broadening measurements suggests a strong
presence of large open-volume defects, likely to be vacancy clusters or voids.

Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which is based on a vulnerability of current

servers composing a CDN, receiving an HTTP request for a resource with an
appended random query string never saw before, ask the origin server for a
(novel) copy of the resource. Such characteristics can be employed to take an
attack against the origin server by exploiting edge servers. Our strategy
adopts a simple gossip protocol executed by edge servers to detect the attack.
Based on such a detection, countermeasures can be taken to protect the origin
server and the CDN against the attack. We provide simulation results that show
the viability of our approach.
