diffusive systems is studied within the context of a generalized ABC model. It
is shown that in the limit of slow nonconserving processes, the large deviation
function of the overall particle density can be computed by making use of the
steady state density profile of the conserving model. In this limit one can
define a chemical potential and identify first order transitions via Maxwell's
construction, similarly to what is done in equilibrium systems. This method may
be applied to other driven models subjected to slow nonconserving dynamics.

The given binary string is fully recoverable from this ROBDD. We exhibit a
lossless data compression algorithm in which a binary string of length a power
of two is compressed via compression of the ROBDD associated to it as described

  We show that when binary strings of length $n$ a power of two are compressed

$(4\log_2s+16+o(1))/\log_2n $. To establish this result, we exploit a result of

infinite gauge coupling, obtained from a worm-type Monte Carlo algorithm on a
discrete spatial lattice but with continuous Euclidean time. This is achieved
by sending both the anisotropy parameter $\gamma^2\simeq a/\at$ and the number
of time-slices $N_\tau$ to infinity, keeping the ratio $\gamma^2/N_\tau \simeq
aT$ fixed. In this limit, ambiguities arising from the anisotropy parameter
$\gamma$ are eliminated and discretization errors usually introduced by a
finite temporal lattice extent $\Nt$ are absent. The obvious gain is that no
continuum extrapolation $N_\tau \rightarrow \infty$ has to be carried out.
Moreover, the algorithm is faster and the sign problem disappears completely.
  As a first application, we determine the phase diagram as a function of
temperature and real and imaginary baryon chemical potential. We compare our
computations with those on lattices with discrete Euclidean time.
Discretization errors due to finite $\Nt$ in previous studies turn out to be
large at low temperatures.

as the origin of dark matter and dark energy of the gravitational nature. The
violation of the local scale invariance alone, with the residual unimodular
one, is considered. Besides the four-volume preserving deformation mode -- the
transverse-tensor graviton -- the metric comprises a compression mode -- the
scalar graviton, or the systolon. A unimodular invariant and general covariant
metric theory of the bimode/scalar-tensor gravity is consistently worked out.
To reduce the primordial ambiguity of the theory a dynamical global symmetry is
imposed, with its subsequent spontaneous breaking revealed. The static
spherically symmetric case in the empty, but possibly for the origin, space is
studied. A three-parameter solution describing a new static space structure --
the dark lacuna -- is constructed. It enjoys the property of gravitational
confinement, with the logarithmic potential of gravitational attraction at the
periphery, and results in the asymptotically flat rotation curves. Comprising a
super-massive dark fracture (a scalar-modified black hole) at the origin
surrounded by a cored dark halo, the dark lacunas are proposed as a prototype
model of galaxies, implying an ultimate account for the distributed
non-gravitational matter and a putative asphericity or rotation.

components of the outflow at hundreds of AU from the massive binary system Eta
Carinae can be understood from the collision of the primary stellar wind with
the slowly expanding dense equatorial gas. Recent high spatial observations of
some forbidden lines, e.g. [Fe III] lambda4659, reveal the outflowing gas
within about one arcsecond (2300 AU) from Eta Car. The distribution of the blue
and red shifted components are not symmetric about the center, and they are
quite different from each other. The morphologies of the blue and red shifted
components correlate with the location of dense slowly moving equatorial gas
(termed the Weigelt blob environment; WBE), that is thought to have been
ejected during the 1887 - 1895 Lesser Eruption. In our model the division to
the blue and red shifted components is caused by the postshock flow of the
primary wind on the two sides of the equatorial plane after it collides with
the WBE. The fast wind from the secondary star plays no role in our model for
these components, and it is the freely expanding primary wind that collides
with the WBE. Because the line of sight is inclined to the binary axis, the two
components are not symmetric. We show that the postshock gas can also account
for the observed intensity in the [Fe III] lambda4659 line.

exoplanets, now numbering at ~690, with ESA's GAIA mission planned to bring

of these worlds: what is their nature? Why are they as they are? The use of the
HST and Spitzer Space Telescope to probe the atmospheres of transiting hot,
gaseous exoplanets has demonstrated that it is possible with current technology
to address this ambitious goal. The measurements have also shown the difficulty
of understanding the physics and chemistry of these environments when having to
rely on a limited number of observations performed on a handful of objects. To
progress substantially in this field, a dedicated facility for exoplanet
characterization with an optimised instrument design (detector performance,
photometric stability, etc.), able to observe through time and over a broad
spectral range a statistically significant number of planets, will be
essential. We analyse the performances of a 1.2/1.4m space telescope for
exoplanet transit spectroscopy from the visible to the mid IR, and present the
SNR ratio as function of integration time and stellar magnitude/spectral type
for the acquisition of spectra of planetary atmospheres in a variety of
scenarios: hot, warm, and temperate planets, orbiting stars ranging in spectral
type from hot F to cool M dwarfs. We include key examples of known planets
(e.g. HD 189733b, Cancri 55 e) and simulations of plausible terrestrial and
gaseous planets, with a variety of thermodynamical conditions. We conclude that

statistical mechanics, graph theory, chaos theory, and computer science. A
rotor-router network defines a deterministic walk on a digraph G in which a
particle walks from a source vertex until it reaches one of several target
vertices. Motivated by recent results due to Giacaglia et al., we study
rotor-router networks in which all non-target vertices have the same type. A
rotor type r is universal if every hitting sequence can be achieved by a
homogeneous rotor-router network consisting entirely of rotors of type r. We
give a conjecture that completely classifies universal rotor types. Then, this
problem is simplified by a theorem we call the Reduction Theorem that allows us
to consider only two-state rotors. A rotor-router network called the
compressor, because it tends to shorten rotor periods, is introduced along with
an associated algorithm that determines the universality of almost all rotors.
New rotor classes, including boppy rotors, balanced rotors, and BURD rotors,
are defined to study this algorithm rigorously. Using the compressor the
universality of new rotor classes is proved, and empirical computer results are
presented to support our conclusions. Prior to these results, less than 100 of
the roughly 260,000 possible two-state rotor types of length up to 17 were
known to be universal, while the compressor algorithm proves the universality
of all but 272 of these rotor types.

moduli. In the simplest KKLT constructions, stabilization of internal
dimensions is rather soft: weak scale masses for moduli are generated, and are
of order m_\sigma ~ m_{3/2}. As a consequence one obtains a pattern of soft
supersymmetry breaking masses found in gravity and/or anomaly mediated
supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models. These models may lead to destabilization
of internal dimensions in the early universe, unless the Hubble constant during
inflation is very small. Fortunately, strong stabilization of compactified
dimensions can be achieved by a proper choice of the superpotential (e.g in the
KL model with a racetrack superpotential). This allows for a solution of the
cosmological moduli problem and for a successful implementation of inflation in
supergravity. We show that strong moduli stabilization leads a very distinct
pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking masses. In general, we find that soft
scalar masses remain of order the gravitino mass, while gaugino masses nearly
vanish at the tree level, i.e. they are of order m_{3/2}^2/m_\sigma. Radiative
corrections generate contributions to gaugino masses reminiscent of AMSB models
and a decoupled spectrum of scalars reminiscent of split-supersymmetry. This
requires a relatively large gravitino mass ~ O(100) TeV, resolving the
cosmological gravitino problem and problems with tachyonic staus in AMSB
models.

We have used ground- and space-based narrow-band optical and near-IR images,
broad-band mid-IR images, optical long-slit echelle spectra, and mid-IR spectra
to investigate its physical structure. These observations indicate that the
inner shell of NGC 6369 can be described as a barrel-like structure shape with
polar bubble-like protrusions, and reveal evidence for H2 and strong polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission from a photo-dissociative region (PDR)
with molecular inclusions located outside the bright inner shell.
High-resolution HST narrow-band images reveal an intricate excitation structure
of the inner shell and a system of ""cometary"" knots. The knotty appearance of
the envelope, the lack of kinematical evidence for shell expansion and the
apparent presence of emission from ionized material outside the PDR makes us
suggest that the envelope of NGC 6369 is not a real shell, but a flattened
structure at its equatorial regions. We report the discovery of irregular knots
and blobs of diffuse emission in low-excitation and molecular line emission
that are located up to 80"" from the central star, well outside the main nebular
shells. We also show that the filaments associated to the polar protrusions
have spatial extents consistent with post-shock cooling regimes, and likely
represent regions of interaction of these structures with surrounding material.

to as the realistic coupling approximation (RCA). The method was illustrated by
EET on a simple linear chain of molecules and also by energy transfer on the
Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex relevant for photosynthesis. The study was
limited to electronic degrees of freedom since this is the origin of coherent
EET in the quantum case. Nevertheless, more realistic models of EET require the
inclusion of the de-cohering effects of coupling to an environment, when the
molecular aggregate becomes an open quantum system. Here we consider the
quantum description of EET on a linear chain and on the FMO complex,
incorporating environment coupling and construct the classical version of the

quantum and exact classical results in the RCA is demonstrated and justified
analytically. This lends further support to the conclusion that the coherence
properties of EET in the FMO complex is evident at the classical level and

quantities are initially segregated by infinite gradients. The focus is placed
on the initial stage of the reaction characterized by a well-defined one
dimensional material contact line between the reactants. Particular attention
is given to the effect of the diffusion of the reactants. This study is an
idealized framework for isentropic mixing in the lower stratosphere and is
motivated by the need to better understand the effect of resolutionon
stratospheric chemistry in Climate-Chemistry Models.
  Adopting a Lagrangian stretching theory approach, we relate theoretically the
ensemble mean of the length of the contact line, of the gradients along it and
of the modulus of the rate of decrease of the space averaged reactant
concentrations (here called the chemical speed) to the joint statistics of the
finite time Lyapunov exponent with two equivalent times. The inverse of the
Lyapunov exponent measures the stretching time scale of a Lagrangian parcel on
a chaotic orbit up to a finite time t, while the first equivalent time measures
it in the recent past before t and the second equivalent time in the early part
of the trajectory. We show that the chemical speed scales like the square root
of the diffusion and that its time evolution is determined by rare large events
in the finite time Lyapunov exponent distribution. The case of smooth initial
gradients is also discussed. The theoretical results are tested with an
ensemble of direct numerical simulations (DNS) using a pseudospectral model.

suggest that the universality results from the quantum reflection of the Efimov

approximation and strong quantum reflection, we obtain an analytic result of
C=9.475... for three identical particles. We suspect the exceptional case of
K-39 is a result of resonant coupling between the Efimov state and a
short-range molecular state.

formulated by Eiter {\em et al.} have been considered as a prominent formalism
for integrating rules and ontology knowledge bases. A question of interest has
been whether dl-programs can be captured in a general formalism of nonmonotonic
logic. In this paper, we study the possibility of embedding dl-programs into
default logic. We show that dl-programs under the strong and weak answer set
semantics can be embedded in default logic by combining two translations, one
of which eliminates the constraint operator from nonmonotonic dl-atoms and the
other translates a dl-program into a default theory. For dl-programs without
nonmonotonic dl-atoms but with the negation-as-failure operator, our embedding
is polynomial, faithful, and modular. In addition, our default logic encoding
can be extended in a simple way to capture recently proposed weakly
well-supported answer set semantics, for arbitrary dl-programs. These results
reinforce the argument that default logic can serve as a fruitful foundation
for query-based approaches to integrating ontology and rules. With its simple
syntax and intuitive semantics, plus available computational results, default
logic can be considered an attractive approach to integration of ontology and
rules.

O(\sqrt(\gamma)) in G, or outputs a certificate that all b-balanced cuts in G
have conductance at least \gamma, and runs in time \tilde{O}(m). This settles
the question of designing asymptotically optimal spectral algorithms for

is the Laplacian of a graph related to G and v is a vector. Algorithms for
computing the matrix-exponential-vector product efficiently comprise our next

approximation to \exp(-A)v for a class of PSD matrices A and a given vector u,
in time roughly \tilde{O}(m_A), where m_A is the number of non-zero entries of
A. This uses, in a non-trivial way, the result of Spielman and Teng on
inverting SDD matrices in \tilde{O}(m_A) time. Finally, we prove e^{-x} can be
uniformly approximated up to a small additive error, in a non-negative interval
[a,b] with a polynomial of degree roughly \sqrt{b-a}. While this result is of
independent interest in approximation theory, we show that, via the Lanczos
method from numerical analysis, it yields a simple algorithm to compute
\exp(-A)v for PSD matrices that runs in time roughly O(t_A \sqrt{||A||}), where
t_A is the time required for computation of the vector Aw for given vector w.
As an application, we obtain a simple and practical algorithm, with output
conductance O(\sqrt(\gamma)), for balanced separator that runs in time
\tilde{O}(m/\sqrt(\gamma)). This latter algorithm matches the running time, but
improves on the approximation guarantee of the algorithm by Andersen and Peres.

semi-synchronous and asynchronous robots when discussing the pattern formation
problem. For semi-synchronous robots, all patterns formable with memory are
also formable without memory, with the single exception of forming a point
(i.e., the gathering) by two robots. However, the gathering problem for two
semi-synchronous robots without memory is trivially solvable when their local
coordinate systems are consistent, and the impossibility proof essentially uses
the inconsistencies in their coordinate systems. Motivated by this, this paper
investigates the magnitude of consistency between the local coordinate systems
necessary and sufficient to solve the gathering problem for two oblivious
robots under semi-synchronous and asynchronous models. To discuss the magnitude
of consistency, we assume that each robot is equipped with an unreliable
compass, the bearings of which may deviate from an absolute reference
direction, and that the local coordinate system of each robot is determined by
its compass. We consider two families of unreliable compasses, namely,static
compasses with constant bearings, and dynamic compasses the bearings of which
can change arbitrarily.
  For each of the combinations of robot and compass models, we establish the
condition on deviation \phi that allows an algorithm to solve the gathering
problem, where the deviation is measured by the largest angle formed between
the x-axis of a compass and the reference direction of the global coordinate
system: \phi < \pi/2 for semi-synchronous and asynchronous robots with static
compasses, \phi < \pi/4 for semi-synchronous robots with dynamic compasses, and
\phi < \pi/6 for asynchronous robots with dynamic compasses. Except for
asynchronous robots with dynamic compasses, these sufficient conditions are
also necessary.

segmentation based directly on IR performance. In the past, segmentation
strategies were mainly validated against manual annotations. Our work shows
that the goodness of a segmentation algorithm as judged through evaluation
against a handful of human annotated segmentations hardly reflects its
effectiveness in an IR-based setup. In fact, state-of the-art algorithms are
shown to perform as good as, and sometimes even better than human annotations
-- a fact masked by previous validations. The proposed framework also provides
us an objective understanding of the gap between the present best and the best
possible segmentation algorithm. We draw these conclusions based on an
extensive evaluation of six segmentation strategies, including three most
recent algorithms, vis-a-vis segmentations from three human annotators. The
evaluation framework also gives insights about which segments should be
necessarily detected by an algorithm for achieving the best retrieval results.
The meticulously constructed dataset used in our experiments has been made
public for use by the research community.

ingredients where strain plays an indispensable role. Through the electric
quadrupolar coupling, strain affects the magnetic environment as seen by the
nuclear spins. To guide prospective single-QD nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
as well as dynamic nuclear spin polarization experiments, an atomistic insight
to the strain and quadrupolar field distributions is presented. A number of
implications of the structural and compositional profile of the QD have been
identified. A high aspect ratio of the QD geometry enhances the quadrupolar
interaction. The inclined interfaces introduce biaxiality and the tilting of
the major quadrupolar principal axis away from the growth axis; the alloy
mixing of gallium into the QD enhances both of these features while reducing
the quadrupolar energy. Regarding the NMR spectra, both Faraday and Voigt
geometries are investigated, unraveling in the first place the extend of
inhomogeneous broadening and the appearance of the normally-forbidden
transitions. Moreover, it is shown that from the main extend of the NMR spectra
the alloy mole fraction of a single QD can be inferred. By means of the
element-resolved NMR intensities it is found that In nuclei has a factor of
five dominance over those of As. In the presence of an external magnetic field,
the borderlines between the quadrupolar and Zeeman regimes are extracted as 1.5
T for In and 1.1 T for As nuclei. At these values the nuclear spin
depolarization rates of the respective nuclei get maximized due to the
noncollinear secular hyperfine interaction with a resident electron in the QD.

using a key covariate to predict membership in latent principal strata. We show
that when treatment received can differ from treatment assigned in both study

treatment arms with different covariate distributions. Adopting a Bayesian
perspective and using Markov chain Monte Carlo for computation, we develop
posterior checks that characterize the extent to which incorporating the
pretreatment covariate endangers estimation of the CACE. We apply the method to
analyze a clinical trial comparing two treatments for jaw fractures in which
the study protocol allowed surgeons to overrule both possible randomized
treatment assignments based on their clinical judgment and the data contained a
key covariate (injury severity) predictive of treatment received.

studied by means of a perturbative renormalization group approach focusing on
static susceptibility. This allows us to obtain the phase diagram for 3<d<4,
with a clear location of the critical lines ending in the conventional quantum
critical points and in the quantum tricritical one, and of the tricritical line
for temperature T \geq 0. We determine also the critical and the tricritical
shift exponents close to the corresponding ground state instabilities.
Remarkably, we find a tricritical shift exponent identical to that found in the
conventional quantum criticality and, by approaching the quantum tricritical
point increasing the non-thermal control parameter r, a crossover of the
quantum critical shift exponents from the conventional value \phi = 1/(d-1) to
the new one \phi = 1/2(d-1). Besides, the projection in the (r,T)-plane of the
phase boundary ending in the quantum tricritical point and crossovers in the
quantum tricritical region appear quite similar to those found close to an
usual quantum critical point. Another feature of experimental interest is that
the amplitude of the Wilsonian classical critical region around this peculiar
critical line is sensibly smaller than that expected in the quantum critical
scenario. This suggests that the quantum tricriticality is essentially governed
by mean-field critical exponents, renormalized by the shift exponent \phi =
1/2(d-1) in the quantum tricritical region.

attractive pairing interaction between pairs of electrons. The Hamiltonian may
be treated using a mean-field method, which is adequate to study equilibrium
properties and a variety of nonequilibrium effects. Nevertheless, in certain
nonequilibrium situations, even in a macroscopic rather than a microscopic
superconductor, the application of mean-field theory may not be valid. In such
cases, one may resort to the full solution of the Hamiltonian, as given by
Richardson in the 1960s. The relevance of Richardson's solution to macroscopic
nonequilibrium superconductors was pointed out recently based on the existence
of quantum instabilities out of equilibrium. It is then of interest to obtain
analytical expressions for expectation values between exact eigenvalues of the
pairing Hamiltonian within the Richardson approach for macroscopic systems. We
undertake this task in the current paper. It should be noted that Richardson's
approach yields the full set of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, while BCS
theory yields only a subset. The results obtained here, then, generalize the
familiar BCS expressions (e.g., for the electron occupation or pairing
correlations) to cases where the spectrum of excitations diverges from BCS
theory (e.g., in cases where the spectrum exhibits multiple gaps).

which the decay from the initial state appears to be inhibited (the quantum

radiation creates a dense shell compressed between an ionization front and a

itself leading to stable growing pillar-like structures. The narrower the
initial interface modulation, the longer the resulting pillar. We interpret
pillars resulting from density modulations in terms of the ability of these

curvature is a key process to understand the formation of structures at the
edge of HII regions. Interface and density modulations at the edge of the cloud
have a direct impact on the morphology of the dense shell during its formation.
Deeper in the cloud, structures have less influence due to the high densities
reached by the shell during its expansion.

We analyze the formation of the first minihalo at z ~ 20 and the subsequent

initialize a set of smaller-scale `cut-out' simulations in which we further
refine the DM to have spatial resolution similar to that of the gas. We test
multiple DM density profiles, and we employ the sink particle method to
represent the accreting star-forming region. We find that, for a range of DM

the positions of the protostars with respect to the DM density peak, such that
there is insufficient DM to influence the formation and evolution of the
protostars for more than ~ 5000 years. In addition, the star-disk system causes
gravitational scattering of the central DM to lower densities, further
decreasing the influence of DM over time. Any DM-powered phase of Pop III stars
will thus be very short-lived for the typical multiple system, and DM will not
serve to significantly prolong the life of Pop III stars.

range from $10^8$ to $10^{12}$M$_{\odot}$ and are visually classified using
both high-resolution NIR (H-band) imaging and optical \texttt{rgb} images. We
find that the bar fraction in disk galaxies is independent of environment
suggesting that bar formation may occur prior to the formation of galaxy
clusters. The bar fraction in early type spirals ($Sa-Sb$) is $\sim$50%, which
is twice as high as the late type spirals ($Sbc-Sm$). The higher bar fraction
in early type spirals may be due to the fact that a significant fraction of
their bulges are pseudo-bulges which form via the buckling instability of a
bar. i.e. a large part of the Hubble sequence is due to secular processes which
move disc galaxies from late to early types. There is a hint of a higher bar
fraction with higher stellar masses which may be due to the susceptibility to
bar instabilities as the baryon fractions increase in halos of larger masses.
Overall, the $S0$ population has a lower bar fraction than the $Sa-Sb$ galaxies
and their barred fraction drops significantly with decreasing stellar mass.
This supports the notion that $S0s$ form via the transformation of disk
galaxies that enter the cluster environment. The gravitational harassment
thickens the stellar disks, wiping out spiral patterns and eventually erasing
the bar - a process that is more effective at lower galaxy masses.

dynamic behaviour of galaxies was initially ascribed to a modification of
Newtonian dynamics (MOND theory) and, consequently, it was used as an argument
to criticize the dark matter hypothesis. In our model, warm dark matter is
composed by collisionless Vlasov particles with a primordial typical velocity
$\simeq 330$ km s$^{-1}$ and, consequently, they evaporated from galactic cores
and reorganized in halos with a cusp at a finite distance from the galactic
center (in contrast with Cold Dark Matter simulations which predict a cusp at
the center of galaxies). This is confirmed by mean-field N-body simulations of
the self-gravitating Vlasov dark matter particles in the potential well of the
baryonic core. The rest mass of these particles, $\mu$, is determined from a
kinetic theory of the early universe with a cosmological constant. We find that

the Sun becomes weaker at the time of the sunspot maximum, we have included a
parametric quenching of the meridional circulation in solar dynamo models such
that the meridional circulation becomes weaker when the magnetic field at the
base of the convection zone is stronger. We find that a flux transport solar
dynamo tends to become unstable on including this quenching of meridional
circulation if the diffusivity in the convection zone is less than about 2 *
10^{11} cm^2/s. The quenching of alpha, however, has a stabilizing effect and
it is possible to stabilize a dynamo with low diffusivity with sufficiently
strong alpha-quenching. For dynamo models with high diffusivity, the quenching
of meridional circulation does not produce a large effect and the dynamo
remains stable. We present a solar-like solution from a dynamo model with
diffusivity 2.8 * 10^{12} cm^2/s in which the quenching of meridional
circulation makes the meridional circulation vary periodically with solar cycle
as observed and does not have any other significant effect on the dynamo.

information about orbital and spin degrees of freedom in transition metal- and
rare earth-compounds. For this purpose usually the dipole transitions of the L-
(2p to 3d) and M- (3d to 4f) edges are employed, whereas higher order
transitions such as quadrupolar 1s to 3d in the K-edge are rarely studied in
that respect. This is due to the fact that usually such quadrupolar transitions
are overshadowed by dipole allowed 1s to 4p transitions and, hence, are visible
only as minor features in the pre-edge region. Nonetheless, these features
carry a lot of valuable information, similar to the dipole L-edge transition,
which is not accessible in experiments under pressure due to the absorption of
the diamond anvil pressurecell. We recently performed a theoretical and
experimental analysis of such a situation for the metal insulator transition of
(V(1-x)Crx)2O3. Since the importance of the orbital degrees of freedom in this
transition is widely accepted, a thorough understanding of quadrupole
transitions of the vanadium K-pre-edge provides crucial information about the
underlying physics. Moreover, the lack of inversion symetry at the vanadium
site leads to onsite mixing of vanadium 3d- and 4p- states and related quantum
mechanical interferences between dipole and quadrupole transitions. Here we
present a theoretical analysis of experimental high resolution x-ray absorption
spectroscopy at the V pre-K edge measured in partial fluorescence yield mode
for single crystals. We carried out density functional as well as configuration
interaction calculations in order to capture effects coming from both,
itinerant and atomic limits.

O((n^{2d} phi^d)^c). This improves the previously best known bounds
significantly. Furthermore, we address the criticism that the perturbations in
smoothed analysis destroy the zero-structure of problems by showing that the
smoothed number of Pareto-optimal solutions remains polynomially bounded even
for zero-preserving perturbations. This broadens the class of problems captured
by smoothed analysis and it has consequences for non-linear objective
functions. One corollary of our result is that the smoothed number of

structures of dynamical dark energy models, characterized by an oscillating
equation of state. The redshift evolution of the equation of state parameter
w(z) for dark energy is characterized by two parameters, describing the
amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations. We consider six different
oscillating dark energy models, each characterized by a different set of
parameter values. Under the common assumption that dark energy is not
clustering on the scales of interest, we study different aspects of cosmic
structure formation. In particular, we self-consistently solve the spherical
collapse problem. We then estimate the behavior of several cosmological
observables, such as the linear growth factor, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
effect, the number counts of massive structures, and the matter and cosmic
shear power spectra. We show that, independently of the amplitude and the
frequency of the dark energy oscillations, none of the aforementioned
observables show an oscillating behavior as a function of redshift. This is a
consequence of the said observables' being integrals over some functions of the
expansion rate over cosmic history. We also notice that deviations with respect
to the expectations for a fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology are generically small,
and in the majority of the cases distinguishing an oscillating dark energy
model would be difficult. Exceptions to this conclusion are provided by the
cosmic shear power spectrum, which for some of the models shows a difference at
the level of \sim 10% over a wide range of angular scales, and the abundance of
galaxy clusters, which is modified at the $\sim 10-20%$ level at $z \gtrsim

to be measured, but there is also a growing interest to determine the
abundances of anthropic elements, like $^{137}$Cs and $^{131}$I, which are used
to monitor the effect of nuclear accidents or other human activities.
  The Full Spectrum Analysis (FSA) approach has been chosen to analyze the
$\gamma$-spectra. The Non Negative Least Square (NNLS) and the energy
calibration adjustment have been implemented in this method for the first time
in order to correct the intrinsic problem related with the $\chi ^2$
minimization which could lead to artifacts and non physical results in the
analysis.
  A new calibration procedure has been developed for the FSA method by using in
situ $\gamma$-spectra instead of calibration pad spectra. Finally, the new
method has been validated by acquiring $\gamma$-spectra with a 10.16 cm x 10.16
cm sodium iodide detector in 80 different sites in the Ombrone basin, in
Tuscany. The results from the FSA method have been compared with the laboratory
measurements by using HPGe detectors on soil samples collected in the different
sites, showing a satisfactory agreement between them. In particular, the
$^{137}$Cs isotopes has been implemented in the analysis since it has been
found not negligible during the in-situ measurements.

species are observable in the dark gas. Their abundances therefore derive
indirectly from those of N-bearing species through chemical modelling. The
recent years have accumulated data which stress our incomplete understanding of
the nitrogen chemistry in dark cloud conditions. To tackle this problem of the
nitrogen chemistry in cold gas, we have revised the formation of nitrogen
hydrides, which is initiated by the key reaction \ce{N+ + H2 -> NH+ + H}. We
propose a new rate for this reaction which depends on the ortho-to-para ratio
of H2. This new rate allows to reproduce the abundance ratios of the three
nitrogen hydrides, NH, \ce{NH2}, and \ce{NH3}, observed towards IRAS16293-2422,
provided that the channel leading to NH from the dissociative recombination of
\ce{N2H+} is not closed at low temperature. The ortho-to-para ratio of H2 is
constrained to O/P=$10^{-3}$ by the abundance ratio NH:NH2, which provides a
new method to measure O/P. This work stresses the need for reaction rates at
the low temperatures of dark clouds, and for branching ratios of critical
dissociative recombination reactions.

requirement in many areas of modern science such as quantum information
processing and the coherent manipulation of molecular systems. It is usually
necessary to realize these quantum manipulations in the shortest possible time
in order to minimize decoherence, and with a large stability against
fluctuations of the control parameters. While optimizing a protocol for speed
leads to a natural lower bound in the form of the quantum speed limit rooted in
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, stability against parameter variations
typically requires adiabatic following of the system. The ultimate goal in
quantum control is to prepare a desired state with 100% fidelity. Here we
experimentally implement optimal control schemes that achieve nearly perfect
fidelity for a two-level quantum system realized with Bose-Einstein condensates
in optical lattices. By suitably tailoring the time-dependence of the system's
parameters, we transform an initial quantum state into a desired final state
through a short-cut protocol reaching the maximum speed compatible with the
laws of quantum mechanics. In the opposite limit we implement the recently
proposed transitionless superadiabatic protocols, in which the system perfectly
follows the instantaneous adiabatic ground state. We demonstrate that
superadiabatic protocols are extremely robust against parameter variations,
making them useful for practical applications.

rapidly declining velocity dispersion along both axes. Jeans models without DM
provide an excellent representation of the data with a mass-to-light ratio
(M/L) of 3.1 (R-band). The most massive Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo the data
allow has a virial mass of only 3.9+3.1-2.1E11 solar masses, although the data
are more consistent with models that have a slight radial anisotropy, which
implies the galaxy has an even lower DM halo mass of 2.2+2.0-1.2E11 solar
masses. Modeling of the h_4 Gauss-Hermite coefficient is inconclusive but seems
to be consistent with mild radial anisotropy. A cored logarithmic DM halo with
parameters r0 = 7 kpc and v0 = 100 km/s can also reproduce the observed
velocity dispersion profile. In conclusion, we cannot easily reproduce the
previous findings of a predominance of DM in NGC 7507 within a simple spherical
model. DM may be present, but only in conjunction with a strong radial
anisotropy, for which there are some indications. (Abridged).

K, many showing Am peculiarities to different degrees), based on
high-dispersion and high-S/N spectral data secured at BOAO (Korea) and OAO
(Japan). We found a significant trend that A(Na) tightly scales with A(Fe)
irrespective of Teff, which means that Na becomes enriched similarly to Fe in
accordance with the degree of Am peculiarity. Regarding lithium, A(Li) mostly
ranges between ~3 and ~3.5 (i.e., almost the same as or slightly less than the
solar system abundance of 3.3) with a weak decreasing tendency with a lowering
of Teff at Teff < 8000 K, though several stars exceptionally show distinctly
larger depletion. The abundances of potassium also revealed an apparent
Teff-dependence in the sense that A(K) in late-A stars tends to be mildly
subsolar (possibly with a weak anti-correlation with A(Fe)) systematically
decreasing from ~5.0 (Teff ~ 8500 K) to ~4.6 (Teff ~ 7500 K), while those for
early-A stars remain near-solar around ~5.0-5.2. These observational facts may
serve as important constraints for any theory aiming to explain chemical
anomalies of A-type stars.

formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention. These
share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as
asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed
relation. My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ
substantially from their ""modified-gravity"" (MG) kin in predicting other
phenomena. Because MI theories are non local in time, MOND effects depend on
the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG
theories. This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the
external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf
galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may
be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not
only on the instantaneous value. And, it is even possible to construct MI
theories with practically no EFE. Other predictions that may differ are also
discussed. Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia
formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these
points.

transform-limited pulses at soft X-ray FELs. Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation
(EEHG) is a promising, recent technique for harmonic generation with an
excellent up-conversion to very high harmonics, from the standpoint of electron
beam physics. This paper explores the constraints on seed laser performance for
reaching wavelengths of 1 nm. We show that the main challenge in implementing
the EEHG scheme at extreme harmonic factors is the requirement for accurate
control of temporal and spatial quality of the seed laser pulse. For example,
if the phase of the laser pulse is chirped before conversion to an UV seed
pulse, the chirp in the electron beam microbunch turns out to be roughly
multiplied by the harmonic factor. In the case of a Ti:Sa seed laser, such
factor is about 800. For such large harmonic numbers, generation of nearly
transform-limited soft X-ray pulses results in challenging constraints on the
Ti:Sa laser. In fact, the relative discrepancy of the time-bandwidth product of
the seed-laser pulse from the ideal transform-limited performance should be no
more than one in a million. The generated electron beam microbunching is also
very sensitive to distortions of the seed laser wavefront, which are also
multiplied by the harmonic factor. In order to have minimal reduction of the
FEL input coupling factor, it is desirable that the size-angular bandwidth
product of the UV seed laser beam be very close to the ideal i.e.
diffraction-limited performance in the waist plane at the middle of the
modulator undulator.

power of the number of layers can be reached. Also structures efficiently

functions, and also for \Gamma(z+1) and \zeta(s). In this paper, unlike [1], we
focus on the case of noninteger \mu. For the simplest function f(z)=z, and
hence for arbitrary polynomials, we show that they are satisfied for arbitrary
real {\mu} (and hence for arbitrary complex {\mu} by analytic continuation).
Using this, we then develop an asymptotic formula for the derivative side of
the root identities for \Gamma(z+1) at arbitrary real \mu, from which we are
able to demonstrate numerically that \Gamma(z+1) also satisfies the generalised
root identities for arbitrary \mu, not just integer values. Finally we examine
the generalised root identites for {\zeta} also for non-integer values of \mu.
Having shown in [1] that {\zeta} satisfies these identities exactly for integer
\mu>1 (and also for \mu=1 after removal of an obstruction), in this paper we
present strong numerical evidence first that {\zeta} satisfies them for
arbitrary \mu>1 where the root side is classically convergent, and then that
this continues to be true also for -1<\mu<1 where C\'esaro divergences must be
removed and C\'esaro averaging of the residual partial-sum functions is
required (when \mu<0). Careful consideration of a neighbourhood of \mu=0 also
sheds light on the appearance of the 2d ln-divergence that was handled
heuristically in [1] and why the assignment of 2d C\'esaro limit 0 to this in
[1] is justified. The numerical calculations for \mu>0 are bundled in portable
R-code; the code for the case -1<\mu<0, including the C\'esaro averaging
required when \mu<0, is in VBA. Both the R-scripts and XL spreadsheet are made

previously to the more natural setting of what we call ""remainder"" Cesaro
summation/convergence and, after illustrating the utility of this approach in
deriving certain classical results, use it to develop a notion of generalised
root identities. These extend elementary root identities for polynomials both
to more general functions and to a family of identities parametrised by a
complex parameter \mu. In so doing they equate one expression (the derivative
side) which is defined via Fourier theory, with another (the root side) which
is defined via remainder Cesaro summation. For \mu a non-positive integer these
identities are naturally adapted to investigating the asymptotic behaviour of
the given function and the geometric distribution of its roots. For the Gamma
function we show that it satisfies the generalised root identities and use them
to constructively deduce Stirling's theorem. For the Riemann zeta function the
implications of the generalised root identities for \mu=0,-1 and -2 are
explored in detail; in the case of \mu=-2 a symmetry of the non-trivial roots
is broken and allows us to conclude, after detailed computation, that the
Riemann hypothesis must be false. In light of this, some final direct
discussion is given of areas where the arguments used throughout the paper are
deficient in rigour and require more detailed justification. The conclusion of
section 1 gives guidance on the most direct route through the paper to the
claim regarding the Riemann hypothesis.

sophisticated business rules and complex calculations without costly custom
programming. BLEM is powerful enough to handle service manageability issues by
analyzing and evaluating the computability and traceability and other criteria
of modified business logic at run time. The web service and QOS grows
expensively based on the reliability of the service. Hence the service provider
of today things that reliability is the major factor and any problem in the
reliability of the service should overcome then and there in order to achieve
the expected level of reliability. In our paper we propose business logic
evaluation model for web service reliability analysis using Finite State
Machine (FSM) where FSM will be extended to analyze the reliability of composed
set of service i.e., services under composition, by analyzing reliability of
each participating service of composition with its functional work flow
process. FSM is exploited to measure the quality parameters. If any change
occurs in the business logic the FSM will automatically measure the
reliability.

in dispersive media without changing their shapes, are ubiquitous in nonlinear
physical systems. Since the first experimental realization of optical bright
solitons in the anomalous dispersion single mode fibers (SMF) by Mollenauer et
al. in 1980 and optical dark solitons in the normal dispersion SMFs by P.
Emplit et al. in 1987, optical solitons in SMFs had been extensively
investigated. In reality a SMF always supports two orthogonal polarization
modes. Taking fiber birefringence into account, it was later theoretically
predicted that various types of vector solitons, including the bright-bright
vector solitons, dark-dark vector solitons and dark-bright vector solitons,
could be formed in SMFs. However, except the bright-bright type of vector
solitons, other types of vector solitons are so far lack of clear experimental
evidence. Optical solitons have been observed not only in the SMFs but also in
mode locked fiber lasers. It has been shown that the passively mode-locked
erbium-doped fiber lasers offer a promising experimental platform for studying
the scalar optical solitons. Vector solitons can also be formed in mode locked
fiber lasers. In this dissertation, the author presents results of a series of
theoretical and experimental investigations on the vector solitons in fiber
lasers.
