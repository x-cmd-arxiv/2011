star formation in both bands, we adopt classification criteria based on X-ray

taking advantage of observations scattered across more than ten years. We
identify 43 objects consistent with being powered by star formation. We also
add another 111 and 70 star forming candidates detected only in the radio or
X-ray band, respectively. We find a clear linear correlation between radio and
X-ray luminosity in star forming galaxies over three orders of magnitude and up
to $z \sim 1.5$. We also measure a significant scatter of the order of 0.4 dex,
higher than that observed at low redshift, implying an intrinsic scatter
component. The correlation is consistent with that measured locally, and no
evolution with redshift is observed. Using a locally calibrated relation
between the SFR and the radio luminosity, we investigate the L_X(2-10keV)-SFR
relation at high redshift. The comparison of the star formation rate measured

typical spiral galaxies, indicates that, with current data, we can trace
typical spirals only at z<0.2, and strong starburst galaxies with

out models in which a large fraction of the surface is occupied by high albedo
(""fresh"") water ice because the measured albedos of Themis and Cybele are low
(0.05 - 0.07). We also rule out models in which a large fraction of the surface

and would sublimate strongly enough for gaseous products to have been detected.
If ice exists on these bodies it must be relatively clean (albedo >0.3) and
confined to a fraction of the Earth-facing surface <10%. By analogy with
impacted asteroid (596) Scheila, we propose an impact excavation scenario, in
which 10 m scale projectiles have exposed buried ice. If the ice is even more
reflective (albedo >0.6) then the timescale for sublimation of an optically

The galaxy is a member of the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS),
and is of particular interest for a detailed examination of a luminous
late-stage merger due to the richness of the optically-visible star clusters
and the extended nature of the nuclear X-ray, mid-IR, CO and radio emission. In
the HST ACS images, the galaxy is shown to contain 156 optically visible star
clusters distributed throughout the nuclear regions and tidal tails of the
merger, with a majority of visible clusters residing in an arc ~ 3-7 kpc from
the position of the mid-infrared core of the galaxy. The luminosity functions
of the clusters have an alpha_F435W ~ -2.17+/-0.22 and alpha_F814W ~
-2.01+/-0.21. Further, the colors and absolute magnitudes of the majority of
the clusters are consistent with instantaneous burst population synthesis model
ages in the range of a few x10^7 - 10^8 yrs (for 10^5 M_sun clusters), but may
be as low as few x10^6 yrs with extinction factored in. The X-ray and mid-IR
spectroscopy are indicative of predominantly starburst-produced nuclear
emission, and the star formation rate is ~ 80 M_sun / yr. The kinematics of the
CO emission and the morphology of both the CO and radio emission are consistent
with the nuclear starburst being situated in a highly inclined disk 2 kpc in
diameter with an infrared surface brightness mu_IR ~ 2x10^11 L_sun kpc^-2, a
factor of 10 less than that of the Orion star-forming region. Finally, the
detection of the [Ne V] 14.32 um emission line is evidence that an AGN is
present. The faintness of the line (i.e., [Ne V] / [Ne II] um ~ 0.01) and the
small equivalent width of the 6.2 um PAH feature ($= 0.39\mu$m) are both
indicative of a relatively weak AGN. (abridged)

several distinct Abelian topological phases whose character is found to depend
on microscopic parameters such as the superlattice spacing or the spin exchange

once at the peak of the outburst, and once 13 days later at its declining
phase.Pulse profiles from both observations exhibit strong energy dependence
with several peaks at low energies and a single peak above ~10 keV. A weak,
narrow peak is detected at the main dip of the pulse profiles from both
observations in the energy bands below 3 keV, indicating the presence of a
phase dependent soft excess in the source continuum. The broad-band energy
spectrum of the pulsar could be fitted well with a partial covering cutoff
power-law model and a narrow iron fluorescence line. We also detect a broad
cyclotron feature at ~50 keV from both observations which is a feature common
for accretion powered pulsars with high magnetic field strengths. Pulse
phase-resolved spectral analysis shows an increase in the absorption column
density of the partial covering component, as well as variation in the covering
fraction at the dips of the pulse profiles, that naturally explains the energy
dependence of the same. The cyclotron line parameters also show significant
variation with pulse phase with a ~ 10 keV variation in the cyclotron line
energy and a variation in depth by a factor of three. This can be explained

not ideal since photometric selection strategies generally evolve considerably
with the acquisition of data. Without a reasonably representative data set
sampling many directions on the sky it is not clear how a rare object search
can be conducted in a highly complete and efficient manner.

realistic model of the spatial, luminosity and colour distributions of sources
known to heavily contaminate photometric quasar selection spaces, namely dwarf
stars of spectral type M, L and T. We use this model along with a subset of

parameter identification. The mission is focused on the low frequency region
([0.1; 10] mHz) of the available signal spectrum. In such a region the signal
is dominated by the force noise acting on test masses. Noise analysis is
expected to deal with a limited amount of non-Gaussian data, since the spectrum
statistics will be far from Gaussian and the lowest available frequency is
limited by the data length. In this paper we analyze the details of the
expected statistics for spectral data and develop two suitable excess noise
estimators. One is based on the statistical properties of the integrated
spectrum, the other is based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The sensitivity of the
estimators is discussed theoretically for independent data, then the algorithms
are tested on LPF synthetic data. The test on realistic LPF data allows the
effect of spectral data correlations on the efficiency of the different noise
excess estimators to be highlighted. It also reveals the versatility of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov approach, which can be adapted to provide reasonable results
on correlated data from a modified version of the standard equations for the
inversion of the test statistic. Closely related to excess noise detection, the
problem of noise parameter identification in non-Gaussian data is approached in
two ways. One procedure is based on maximum likelihood estimator and another is
based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit estimator. Both approaches
provide unbiased and accurate results for noise parameter estimation and
demonstrate superior performance with respect to standard weighted
least-squares and Huber's norm.

connected, undirected graph and, at each time step, an individual is chosen at
random with probability proportional to its assigned 'fitness' value. It
reproduces, placing a copy of itself on a neighbouring vertex chosen uniformly
at random, replacing the individual that was there. The initial population
consists of a single mutant of fitness $r>0$ placed uniformly at random, with
every other vertex occupied by an individual of fitness 1. The main quantities
of interest are the probabilities that the descendants of the initial mutant
come to occupy the whole graph (fixation) and that they die out (extinction);
almost surely, these are the only possibilities. In general, exact computation
of these quantities by standard Markov chain techniques requires solving a
system of linear equations of size exponential in the order of the graph so is
not feasible. We show that, with high probability, the number of steps needed
to reach fixation or extinction is bounded by a polynomial in the number of
vertices in the graph. This bound allows us to construct fully polynomial

  math/0612751",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of packing Hamilton cycles in random and pseudorandom graphs has
been studied extensively. In this paper, we look at the dual question of
covering all edges of a graph by Hamilton cycles and prove that if a graph with
maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies some basic expansion properties and contains
a family of $(1-o(1))\Delta/2$ edge disjoint Hamilton cycles, then there also
exists a covering of its edges by $(1+o(1))\Delta/2$ Hamilton cycles. This
implies that for every $\alpha >0$ and every $p \geq n^{\alpha-1}$ there exists
a covering of all edges of $G(n,p)$ by $(1+o(1))np/2$ Hamilton cycles
asymptotically almost surely, which is nearly optimal.

energization at the shear boundary, driven by streaming instabilities across
the shear interface and sustained by the shear flow. Nonthermal, anisotropic
high-energy particles are accelerated across field lines to produce a power-law
tail, truncated at energies below the shear Lorentz factor. These results have
important implications for the dissipation and radiation of jets in blazars,

multi-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the TeV gamma-ray
(H.E.S.S.), GeV gamma-ray (Fermi/LAT), X-ray (RXTE, Swift), UV (Swift) and
optical (ATOM, Swift) bands. This campaign was carried out during a high flux
state in the synchrotron regime. The flux in the optical and X-ray bands
reached the level of the historical maxima. The hard GeV spectrum observed with
Fermi/LAT connects well to the very high energy (VHE, E>100GeV) spectrum
measured with H.E.S.S. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 GeV. Compared to
observations with contemporaneous coverage in the VHE and X-ray bands in 2004,
the X-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the TeV
gamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. The spectral energy
distribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zone
synchrotron self-Compton model with a well determined cutoff in X-rays. The
parameters of a one zone SSC model are inconsistent with variability time
scales. The variability behaviour over years with the large changes in
synchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse Compton emission does not
warrant an interpretation within a one-zone SSC model despite an apparently
satisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

  A prototype of the final detector equipped with about 400 PMs (RICH-400

separation was tested, as well as the effect of the pollution of the neon

probability is about 0.7% and the time resolution better than 100 ps in the

  We did not observe any absorption of the light due to the pollution of the
radiator, however an effect on the ring radius is clearly observed due to the
change of the change of the refractive index of the medium. The conclusion of
the studies is that the amount of CO_2 in the final detector should be well
known or the quality of the pion identification could be seriously compromised.

  We study the first step of this process. What are the kinds of objects to be
studied via $K$-theory? Given these types of objects, what structured
categories should one associate to an object to obtain $K$-theoretic

be in some tension with the LCDM model. We use a composite catalogue of 4,537
peculiar velocity measurements with a characteristic depth of 33 h-1 Mpc to
estimate the matter power spectrum. We compare the constraints with this
method, directly studying the full peculiar velocity catalogue, to results from
Macaulay et al. (2011), studying minimum variance moments of the velocity
field, as calculated by Watkins, Feldman & Hudson (2009) and Feldman, Watkins &
Hudson (2010). We find good agreement with the LCDM model on scales of k > 0.01
h Mpc-1. We find an excess of power on scales of k < 0.01 h Mpc-1, although
with a 1 sigma uncertainty which includes the LCDM model. We find that the
uncertainty in the excess at these scales is larger than an alternative result
studying only moments of the velocity field, which is due to the minimum
variance weights used to calculate the moments. At small scales, we are able to
clearly discriminate between linear and nonlinear clustering in simulated
peculiar velocity catalogues, and find some evidence (although less clear) for
linear clustering in the real peculiar velocity data.

temporal extent $N_t=4$ and 6, with masses small enough to yield access to the

and chiral-symmetry restoration transitions, both of which move to appreciably
weaker couplings as $N_t$ is increased from 4 to 6. If this theory is
conformal, we would expect there to be a bulk chiral transition at a fixed
coupling. For this reason we conclude that for $N_t=4$ and 6, the chiral and
hence the deconfinement transitions are in the strong-coupling domain where the
theory is essentially quenched. The similarity between the behaviours of the 2

calculated for arbitrary explosion and radiation parameters by scaling the peak
flux and the critical frequencies connecting different spectral regimes. Only
one baseline calculation needs to be done for each jet opening angle and
observer angle. These calculations are done numerically using high-resolution
relativistic hydrodynamical afterglow blast wave simulations which include the
two-dimensional dynamical features of expanding and decelerating afterglow
blast waves. Any light curve can then be generated by applying scaling
relations to the baseline calculations.
  As a result, it is now possible to fully fit for the shape of the jet break,
e.g. at early time X-ray and optical frequencies. In addition, late-time radio
calorimetry can be improved since the general shape of the transition into the
Sedov-Taylor regime is now known for arbitrary explosion parameters so the
exact moment when the Sedov-Taylor asymptote is reached in the light curve is
no longer relevant.
  When calculating the baselines, we find that the synchrotron critical
frequency and the cooling break frequency are strongly affected by the jet
break. The synchrotron break temporal slope quickly drops to the steep late
time Sedov-Taylor slope, while the cooling break first steepens then rises to
meet the level of its shallow late time asymptote.

implications for SI violation studies. Constraining SI violation will only be
possible by complementing CMB data sets with all sky measurements of the large

quasar spectra arise from gas structures associated with foreground galaxies.
The degree to which galaxy evolution is driven by the gas cycling through halos
is highly uncertain because their gas mass density is poorly constrained.
Fitting the MgII equivalent width (W) distribution with a Schechter function
and applying the N(HI)-W correlation of Menard & Chelouche, we computed
Omega(HI)_MgII ~ Omega(HI)_halo =(1.41 +0.75 -0.44)x10^-4 for 0.4<z<1.4. We
exclude DLAs from our calculations so that Omega(HI)_halo comprises accreting
and/or outflowing halo gas not locked up in cold neutral clouds. We deduce the
cosmic HI gas mass density fraction in galactic halos traced by MgII absorption
is Omega(HI)_halo/Omega(HI)_DLA=15% and Omega(HI)_halo/Omega_b=0.3%. Citing
several lines of evidence, we propose infall/accretion material is sampled by
small W whereas outflow/winds are sampled by large W, and find Omega(HI)_infall
is consistent with Omega(HI)_outflow for bifurcation at
W=1.23^{+0.15}_{-0.28}\AA; cold accretion would then comprise no more than ~7%
of of the total HI mass density. We discuss evidence that (1) the total HI mass
cycling through halos remains fairly constant with cosmic time and that the
accretion of HI gas sustains galaxy winds, and (2) evolution in the cosmic star

close or very distant. The derived upper limits on the mass accretion rate of
the white dwarf are untypical for symbiotic stars and may favor the picture of

have shorter disk scale lengths than those at longer wavelengths. This
indicates that the star-forming disk has been shrinking. In addition, the
radial distributions of the stellar mass surface density are well described as
piece-wise exponential profiles, and \sim 80% of the galaxies have steeper mass
profiles in the outer disk than in the inner region. The steep radial decline
of SF rate in the outer parts compared to that in the inner disks gives a
natural explanation for the down-bending stellar mass surface density profiles.
Within the inner disks, our sample galaxies on average have constant ratios of
recent SF rate to stellar mass with radius. Nevertheless, \sim 35% (12
galaxies, among which 7 have baryonic mass < 10^8 M\odot) of the sample exhibit
negative slopes across the observed disk, which is in contrast with the

tendency of SF to become concentrated toward the inner disks in low mass dIrrs
is interpreted as a result of their susceptibility to environmental effects and
regulation through stellar feedback.

\times U(1)_Y$, this produces two heavy $Z^\prime$ bosons and two heavy
$W^{\prime\pm}$ bosons, along with a single Standard Model-like Higgs scalar.
The unique feature of the model was that it was possible to obtain electroweak
symmetry breaking and a light Higgs mass entirely from perturbative loop
contributions to the Higgs effective potential. In this paper we consider the

the universal oblique and non-oblique parameters, tree-level corrections to the

for the global symmetry breaking be $\gtrsim2$ TeV, depending on the top-quark
mixing parameter and the extra gauge couplings. In addition, the loop
corrections to $Zb\bar{b}$ contain a divergence that must be absorbed into the

space-time, for instance by determining empirically the angular diameter
distance-redshift relation. This geometric test has been demonstrated several
times using massive clusters which produce a large lensing signal. In this
case, matter at a single redshift dominates the lensing signal, so the analysis
is straightforward. It is less clear how weaker signals from multiple sources
at different redshifts can be stacked to demonstrate the geometric dependence.
We introduce a simple measure of relative shear which for flat cosmologies
separates the effect of lens and source positions into multiplicative terms,
allowing signals from many different source-lens pairs to be combined. Applying
this technique to a sample of groups and low-mass clusters in the COSMOS
survey, we detect a clear variation of shear with distance behind the lens.
This represents the first detection of the geometric effect using weak lensing
by multiple, low-mass systems. The variation of distance with redshift is
measured with sufficient precision to constrain the equation of state of the
universe under the assumption of flatness, equivalent to a detection of a dark
energy component Omega_X at greater than 99% confidence for an
equation-of-state parameter -2.5 < w < -0.1. For the case w = -1, we find a

selected using the Halpha line in place of the [OII]3727 line as the indicator
of on-going star formation (or lack thereof). This allowed us to select a lower
redshift sample of galaxies than available in the literature since the
[OII]3727 falls off the blue end of the wavelength coverage in the SDSS for the
very lowest redshift objects. This low redshift selection means that the
galaxies have a large angular to physical scale which allows us to resolve the
central ~1kpc region of the galaxies; the region where stellar population
gradients are expected. Such observations have been difficult to make using
other higher redshift samples because even at redshifts z~0.1 the angular to
physical scale is similar to the resolution provided by ground based seeing.
Our integral field spectroscopy has enabled us to make the first robust
detections of Balmer line gradients in the centres of E+A galaxies. Six out of

This is evidence for compact young cores and stellar population gradients which
are predicted from models of mergers and tidal interactions which funnel gas
into the galaxy core. Given the generally isolated nature of our sample this
argues for the galaxies being seen in the late stage of a merger where the

oscillates as a function of the wavenumber. We find that in the regime of

the 2-point function, implying that the signature of oscillations, if ever
detected, will be easier to find first in the 2-point function, and only then

higher-order correlation functions, that we study here in generality, could be

Twitter, the size of the elite is a result of conflicting social forces
competing to increase or decrease it.
  The main contribution of this paper is the answer to the question how large
the elite is at equilibrium. We take an axiomatic approach to solve this:
assuming that an elite exists and it is influential, stable and either minimal
or dense, we prove that its size must be $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ (where $m$ is the
number of edges in the network).
  As an approximation for the elite, we then present an empirical study on nine
large real-world networks of the subgraph formed by the highest degree nodes,
also known as the rich-club. Our findings indicate that elite properties such
as disproportionate influence, stability and density of
$\Theta(\sqrt{m})$-rich-clubs are universal properties and should join a
growing list of common phenomena shared by social networks and complex systems

physically plausible. The intrinsic breakdown of FFE should mean that the FFE
description of the singular current layer (the only region of magnetosphere
where FFE and the high-conductivity SFE differ) is incorrect. Then the
high-conductivity SFE should be the right theory for real pulsars too, and the
pure-FFE description of pulsars should be discarded.

Population III star formation rate (SFR) to be <0.3% of the total SFR, and
<1.25% of the observed SFR (both at the 2-$\sigma$ level). Only one LAE was
detected in both the X-ray and radio, while the other objects remained
undetected, even when stacked. The Lya LF in our two deepest narrowband filters
in the ECDFS differ at >2$\sigma$ significance, and the product $L^*\Phi^*$
differs by a factor of >3. Similar LF differences have been used to infer
evolution in the neutral gas fraction in the intergalactic medium at z>6, yet
here the difference is likely due to cosmic variance, given that the two

the cosmic SFR density, but since field-to-field and survey-to-survey

distribution of some quantity. Often this quantity to be measured is smeared by
a non-ideal detector response or by some physical process. The procedure of
removing this smearing effect from the measured distribution is called
unfolding, and is a delicate problem in signal processing, due to the
well-known numerical ill behavior of this task. Various methods were invented
which, given some assumptions on the initial probability distribution, try to
regularize the unfolding problem. Most of these methods definitely introduce
bias into the estimate of the initial probability distribution. We propose a
linear iterative method, which has the advantage that no assumptions on the
initial probability distribution is needed, and the only regularization
parameter is the stopping order of the iteration, which can be used to choose
the best compromise between the introduced bias and the propagated statistical
and systematic errors. The method is consistent: ""binwise"" convergence to the
initial probability distribution is proved in absence of measurement errors
under a quite general condition on the response function. This condition holds
for practical applications such as convolutions, calorimeter response
functions, momentum reconstruction response functions based on tracking in
magnetic field etc. In presence of measurement errors, explicit formulae for
the propagation of the three important error terms is provided: bias error,
statistical error, and systematic error. A trade-off between these three error
terms can be used to define an optimal iteration stopping criterion, and the
errors can be estimated there. We provide a numerical C library for the
implementation of the method, which incorporates automatic statistical error
propagation as well.

wavelet estimator and show the conditions to reach optimality. We include the
linear term correction in our estimators and compare the estimates with the
values already published using only the cubic term. The estimators are tested
with realistic WMAP simulations with anisotropic noise and the WMAP KQ75 sky
cut. The inclusion of the linear term correction shows a negligible improvement
(< 1 per cent) in the error-bar for any of the shapes considered. The results
of this analysis show that, in the particular case of the wavelet estimator,
the optimality for WMAP anisotropy levels is basically achieved with the mean
subtraction and in practical terms there is no need of including a linear term
once the mean has been subtracted. Our best estimates are now: local fnl = 39.0
+/ 21.4, equilateral fnl = -62.8 +/- 154.0 and orthogonal fnl = -159.8 +/-

generalizes the Kerov's operators first appeared in [Okounkov,
arXiv:math/0002135], and also stems from the study of duality of graded graphs
in [Fomin, 1994].
  Our main object is a countable branching graph carrying an sl(2,C)-module of
a special kind. Using this structure, we introduce distinguished probability
measures on the floors of the graph, and define two related types of Markov
dynamics associated with these measures. We study spectral properties of the
dynamics, and our main result is the explicit description of eigenfunctions of
the Markov generator of one of the processes.
  For the Young graph our approach reconstructs the z-measures on partitions
and the associated dynamics studied by Borodin and Olshanski
[arXiv:math-ph/0409075, arXiv:0706.1034]. The generator of the dynamics of
[arXiv:math-ph/0409075] is diagonal in the basis of the Meixner symmetric
functions introduced recently by Olshanski [arXiv:1009.2037, arXiv:1103.5848].
We give new proofs to some of the results of these two papers. Other graphs to
which our technique is applicable include the Pascal triangle, the Kingman
graph (with the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet measures), the Schur graph and
the general Young graph with Jack edge multiplicities.

multiple major mergers of galaxies. The expected rate of such mergers is,
however, too low to reproduce the observed number of ULIRGs with multiple

gas-rich disk galaxies. We found that extremely massive and compact star
clusters form from the strongly disturbed gas disks after the first or second

consist of young stars, they appear to be several bright cores in the galactic
central region ($\sim \rm{kpc}$). The peak luminosity of these clusters reaches
$\sim 10%$ of the total luminosity of the merging galaxy. These massive and
compact clusters are consistent with the characteristics of the observed
multiple nuclei in ULIRGs. Multiple mergers are not necessary to explain

such gradients are far from being rare, but common and typically persistent
over several years, although some of them may show a reversal in the direction

perpendicular to the jet as indications of the change of the line of sight of
the magnetic field due to its helicity, and gradients parallel to the jet as
the decrease of magnetic field strength and/or electron density as we move
along the jet. When comparing our results with the literature, we find
tentative evidence of a rotation measure gradient flip, which can be explained
as a change of the pitch angle or jet bending.

is accomplished by employing the inquiry calculus, which is dual to the

that the information redundancy is minimized by maximizing the joint entropy of

while minimizing the mutual information between them. Maximum joint entropy is
therefore an important principle of information-based collaboration, which

IRS causes a significant reduction of the cut-off frequency. The fluctuations

several asymptotically tight hierarchies of semidefinite programming

induced by weak disorder is studied for both scalar-potential and
vector-potential GSLs, computationally as well as analytically by a
weak-disorder expansion. In particular, it is investigated how the Lyapunov
exponent (inverse localization length) depends on the incidence angle to a 1D
GSL. Delocalization resonances are found for both scalar and vector GSLs. The
sharp angular dependence of the Lyapunov exponent may be exploited to realize
disorder-induced filtering, as verified by full 2D numerical wave packet

are a major contributor to the Galactic $\gamma$-ray source population. Such
pulsars may also be important in modeling the quiescent state of several low
mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), where optical observations of the companion star
suggest the possible existence of rotation powered MSPs. To understand the
observational properties of the different evolutionary stages of MSPs, the
X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the outer gap model is
investigated. For rotation powered MSPs, the size of the outer gap and the
properties of the high-energy emission are controlled by either the
photon-photon pair-creation process or magnetic pair-creation process near the
surface. For these pulsars, we find that the outer gap model controlled by the
magnetic pair-creation process is preferable in explaining the possible
correlations between the $\gamma$-ray luminosity or non-thermal X-ray
luminosity versus the spin down power. For the accreting MSPs in quiescent
LMXBs, the thermal X-ray emission at the neutron star surface resulting from
deep crustal heating can control the conditions in the outer gap. We argue that
the optical modulation observed in the quiescent state of several LMXBs
originates from the irradiation of the donor star by $\gamma$-rays from the
outer gap. In these systems, the irradiation luminosity required for the
optical modulation of the source such as SAX J1808.4-3658 can be achieved for a
neutron star of high mass. Finally, we discuss the high-energy emission

CPA, a lossy medium in an optical cavity with a specific degree of dissipation,
equal in modulus to the gain of the lasing medium, can perfectly absorb
coherent optical waves that are the time-reversed counterpart of the lasing

the frequency of the field at which CPA occurs is generally different than the
one of the lasing mode. Moreover, at a large cooperation parameter the
observation of CPA in the presence of bistability requires to operate in the

Field Ising Model on the Cayley tree [L. Ioffe and M. M\'ezard, PRL 105, 037001

magnetization in $d=1$ [O. Dimitrova and M. M\'ezard, J. Stat. Mech. (2011)
P01020]. In the present paper, we propose to extend these ideas in finite
dimensions $d>1$ via a non-linear transfer approach for the surface
magnetization. In the disordered phase, the linearization of the transfer
equations correspond to the transfer matrix for a Directed Polymer in a random
medium of transverse dimension $D=d-1$, in agreement with the leading order
perturbative scaling analysis [C. Monthus and T. Garel, arxiv:1110.3145]. We
present numerical results of the non-linear transfer approach in dimensions
$d=2$ and $d=3$. In both cases, we find that the critical point is governed by
Infinite Disorder scaling. In particular exactly at criticality, the one-point
surface magnetization scales as $\ln m_L^{surf} \simeq - L^{\omega_c} v$, where
$\omega_c(d)$ coincides with the droplet exponent $\omega_{DP}(D=d-1)$ of the
corresponding Directed Polymer model, with $\omega_c(d=2)=1/3$ and
$\omega_c(d=3) \simeq 0.24$. The distribution $P(v)$ of the positive random
variable $v$ of order O(1) presents a power-law singularity near the origin
$P(v) \propto v^a$ with $a(d=2,3)>0$ so that all moments of the surface
magnetization are governed by the same power-law decay $\bar{(m_L^{surf})^k}
\propto L^{- x_S}$ with $x_S=\omega_c (1+a)$ independently of the order $k$.

described in terms of such edges. The main motivation for considering this
category is that the additive functors from R_p to abelian groups are exactly
the rational p-biset functors. This yields in particular very efficient ways of
computing such functors on arbitrary p-groups : this applies to the
representation functors R_K, where K is any field of characteristic 0, but also
to the functor of units of Burnside rings, or to the torsion part of the Dade

in \cite{kac}: (1) prove the propagation of chaos for realistic microscopic
interactions (i.e. in our results: hard spheres and true Maxwell molecules);
(2) relate the time scales of relaxation of the stochastic process and of the
limit equation by obtaining rates independent of the number of particles; (3)
prove the convergence of the many-particle entropy towards the Boltzmann
entropy of the solution to the limit equation (microscopic justification of the
$H$-theorem of Boltzmann in this context). These results crucially rely on a
new theory of quantitative uniform in time estimates of propagation of chaos.

Recently, specially designed observables, which can be determined in the
angular distribution of B --> K^*(--> K pi) l^+ l^-, became of particular
interest since they are subject of reduced hadronic uncertainties and currently
their potential role in a global analysis is under investigation.

the beam and searching for the minimum excited HOM power.

models which are implicitly defined. We consider 1-dimensional and
2-dimensional overlapping generations models, a cash-in-advance model,
heterogeneous markets and a cobweb model with adaptive adjustment. We consider
the inverse limit spaces of certain chaotic invariant fractal sets and their
metric, ergodic and stability properties. The inverse limits give the set of
intertemporal perfect foresight equilibria for the economic problem considered.
First we show that the inverse limits of these models are stable under
perturbations. We prove that the inverse limits are expansive and have
specification property. We then employ utility functions on inverse limits in
our case. We give two ways to rank such utility functions. First, when
perturbing certain dynamical systems, we rank utility functions in terms of
their \textit{average values} with respect to invariant probability measures on
inverse limits, especially with respect to measures of maximal entropy. For
families of certain unimodal maps we can adjust both the discount factor and
the system parameters in order to obtain maximal average value of the utility.
The second way to rank utility functions (for more general maps on hyperbolic
sets) will be to use equilibrium measures of these utility functions on inverse
limits; they optimize average values of utility functions while \textit{at the
same time} keeping the disorder in the system as low as possible in the long
run.

gaps. This is partly due to extensive studies of historical plate archives by
Rene Hudec and associates, and partly due to several observing campaigns in
recent times. Here we summarize the results of the 2005 - 2010 observing
campaign, in which several hundred scientists and amateur astronomers took
part. The main results are the following: (1) The 2005 October optical outburst
came at the expected time, thus confirming the General Relativistic precession
in the binary black hole system. At the same time, this result disproved the
model of a single black hole system with accretion disk oscillations, as well
as several toy models of binaries without relativistic precession. (2) The
nature of the radiation of the 2005 October outburst was expected to be
bremsstrahlung from hot gas at a temperature of 3 10^5 degrees K. This was
confirmed by combined ground based and ultraviolet observations using the
XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. (3) A secondary outburst of the same nature was
expected at 2007 September 13. Within the accuracy of the observations (about 6
hours), it started at the correct time. Due to the bremsstrahlung nature of the
outburst, the radiation was unpolarized, as expected. (4) Further synchrotron
outbursts were expected following the two bremsstrahlung outbursts. They came
as scheduled between 2007 October and 2009 December. (5) Due to the effect of
the secondary on the overall direction of the jet, the parsec scale jet is
expected to rotate in the sky by a large angle, which has been confirmed. The
OJ287 binary black hole system is currently our best laboratory for testing
theories of gravitation. Using OJ287, the correctness of General Relativity has
now been demonstrated up to the second Post-Newtonian order, higher than has
been possible using binary pulsars.

front, we observe downward plasma flows in the EIS Fe XII, Fe XIII, and Fe XVI
spectral lines (log T ~ 6.1-6.4) with line-of-sight (LOS) velocities up to 20
km/s. These red-shifts are followed by blue-shifts with upward velocities up to
-5 km/s indicating relaxation of the plasma behind the wave front. During the
wave evolution, the downward velocity pulse steepens from a few km/s up to 20
km/s and subsequently decays, correlated with the relative changes of the line
intensities. The expected increase of the plasma densities at the EIT wave
front estimated from the observed intensity increase lies within the noise
level of our density diagnostics from EIS XIII 202/203 AA line ratios. No
significant LOS plasma motions are observed in the He II line, suggesting that
the wave pulse was not strong enough to perturb the underlying chromosphere.
This is consistent with the finding that no Halpha Moreton wave was associated
with the event. The EIT wave propagating along the EIS slit reveals a strong
deceleration of a ~ -540 m/s2 and a start velocity of v0 ~ 590 km/s. These
findings are consistent with the passage of a coronal fast-mode MHD wave,
pushing the plasma downward and compressing it at the coronal base.

universe predicts the presence of dark matter subhaloes, hosted by Milky
Way-sized galaxies. Anticipated subhalo masses range from 10^{10} down to a
cut-off mass between 10^{-3} and 10^{-11} solar masses. If dark matter is
composed of heavy self-annihilating or decaying particles, these subhaloes
could be visible in the gamma-ray band as faint and temporally constant sources

current observational constraints on annihilating dark matter scenarios, we
predict that one massive Galactic subhalo between 10^6 and 10^8 solar masses
may already be present in the 11-month catalogue of Fermi-LAT. Indeed, at least
twelve objects in the first Fermi catalogue qualify as candidates. The most
promising object, 1FGL J0030.7+0724, is investigated in detail using a
dedicated Swift X-ray follow-up observation and a refined positional analysis
of the 24-month Fermi-LAT data. With the new observations, seven point-like
X-ray sources have been discovered, of which SWIFT J003119.8+072454, which
coincides with a faint radio source (12 mJy at 1.4 GHz), serves as a
counterpart candidate of 1FGL J0030.7+0724. The broad-band spectral energy
distribution is consistent with a high-energy-peaked blazar. However, flux and

Detection of temporal variability or improved astrometry of 1FGL J0030.7+0724
are necessary to rule out or confirm an astrophysical origin. We discuss
strategies to identify gamma-ray sources that are associated with

Above a boundary region the eigenmodes become delocalized and obey Random

approaches to fragmentation were compared to the measurements.
Leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo calculations interfaced to the Lund
string fragmentation model describe the data reasonably well in the whole range
measured. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations based on fragmentation
functions, FFs, extracted from e+e- data alone, fail to describe the
measurements. The calculations based on FFs extracted from a global analysis
including e+e-, ep and pp data give an improved description. The measurements
presented in this paper have the potential to further constrain the FFs of

polygonal lines with vertices on $\mathbb{Z}_+^2$, starting at the origin and
with the right endpoint $n=(n_1,n_2)\to\infty$. In the case of the uniform
measure, an explicit limit shape $\gamma^*:=\{(x_1,x_2)\in\mathbb{R}_+^2\colon

B\'ar\'any (1995), and Sinai (1994). Recently, Bogachev and Zarbaliev (2011)
proved that the limit shape $\gamma^*$ is universal for a certain parametric
family of multiplicative probability measures generalizing the uniform
distribution. In the present work, the universality result is extended to a
much wider class of multiplicative measures, including (but not limited to)
analogs of the three meta-types of decomposable combinatorial structures --
multisets, selections and assemblies. This result is in sharp contrast with the
one-dimensional case where the limit shape of Young diagrams associated with
integer partitions heavily depends on the distributional type.

Heisenberg model with magnetic dipole and exchange interactions by the spin
operator diagram technique. Dispersion relations of spin waves in thin magnetic
films (in two-dimensional magnetic monolayers and in two-layer magnetic films)
and the spin-wave resonance spectrum in N-layer structures are found. For thick
magnetic films generalized Landau-Lifshitz equations are derived from first
principles. Landau-Lifshitz equations have the integral (pseudodifferential)
form, but not differential one. Spin excitations are determined by simultaneous
solution of the Landau-Lifshitz equations and the equation for the
magnetostatic potential. For normal magnetized ferromagnetic films the spin
wave damping has been calculated in the one-loop approximation for a diagram
expansion of the Green functions at low temperature. In thick magnetic films
the magnetic dipole interaction makes a major contribution to the relaxation of
long-wavelength spin waves. Thin films have a region of low relaxation of
long-wavelength spin waves. In thin magnetic films four-spin-wave processes
take place and the exchange interaction makes a major contribution to the
damping. It is found that the damping of spin waves propagating in magnetic
monolayer is proportional to the quadratic dependence on the temperature and is
very low for spin waves with small wavevectors. Spin-wave devices on the base
of nanosized magnetic films are proposed -- tunable narrow-band spin-wave
filters with high quality at the microwave frequency range and field-effect

sensitive probe of fluctuations in the interstellar magnetic field and ionized
gas density resulting from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We used a set
of statistical tools to analyze images of the spatial gradient of linearly
polarized radio emission ($|\nabla \textbf{P}|$) from the ISM for both
observational data from a test image of the Southern Galactic Plane Survey
(SGPS) and isothermal simulations of MHD turbulence. We compared the
observational data with results of synthetic observations obtained with the
simulations of 3D turbulence. Visually, in both data sets, a complex network of
filamentary structures is seen. Our analysis shows that the filaments in the
gradient can be produced by shocks as well as random fluctuations
characterizing the non-differentiable field of MHD turbulence. The latter
dominates for subsonic turbulence, while the former dominates for supersonic
turbulence. In order to quantitatively characterize these differences we use
the topology tool known as a genus curve as well as the moments of the image
distribution. We find that higher values for the moments correspond to cases of
$|\nabla \textbf{P}|$ with larger Mach numbers, but the strength of the
dependency is connected to the telescope angular resolution. In regards to the
topology, the supersonic filaments observed in $|\nabla \textbf{P}|$ have a
positive genus shift, which indicates a ""swisscheese"" like topology, while the
subsonic cases show a negative genus, indicating a ""clump"" like topology. In
the case of the genus, the dependency on the telescope resolution is not as
strong. The SGPS test region data has a distribution and morphology that
matches subsonic to transsonic type turbulence, which independently confirms
what is now expected for the WIM.

This result is obtained implementing, in the limit of isotropic velocity

univocally the dark matter distribution function to the density profile, and
applying, within a Bayesian framework, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to
sample mass models for the Milky Way against a broad and variegated sample of
dynamical constraints. We consider three possible choices for the dark matter
density profile, namely the Einasto, NFW and Burkert profiles, finding that the
velocity dispersion, which characterizes the width in the distribution, tends
to be larger for the Burkert case, while the escape velocity depends very
weakly on the profile, with the mean value we obtain being in very good
agreement with estimates from stellar kinematics. The derived dark matter
phase-space densities differ significantly--most dramatically in the high
velocity tails--from the model usually taken as a reference in dark matter
detection studies, a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with velocity dispersion
fixed in terms of the local circular velocity and with a sharp truncation at a
given value of the escape velocity. We discuss the impact of astrophysical
uncertainties on dark matter scattering rates and direct detection exclusion
limits, considering a few sample cases and showing that the most sensitive ones
are those for light dark matter particles and for particles scattering
inelastically. As a general trend, when adopting a self-consistent phase-space
density, we find that rates are larger, and hence exclusion limits stronger,
than with the standard Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation. Tools for applying our

particles interacting via radially symmetric pair potentials. We suggest that a
simple liquid should be defined instead by the property of having strong
correlation between virial and potential energy equilibrium fluctuations in the
NVT ensemble. There is considerable overlap between the two definitions, but
also some notable differences. For instance, in the new definition simplicity
is not a property of the intermolecular potential only because a liquid is
usually only strongly correlating in part of its phase diagram. Moreover,
according to the new definition not all simple liquids are atomic (i.e., with
radially symmetric pair potentials) and not all atomic liquids are simple. The
main part of the paper motivates the new definition of liquid simplicity by
presenting evidence that a liquid is strongly correlating if and only if its
intermolecular interactions may be ignored beyond the first coordination shell
(FCS). This is demonstrated by NVT simulations of structure and dynamics of 15
atomic and molecular model liquids with a shifted-forces cutoff placed at the
first minimum of the radial distribution function. No proof is given that the
chemical characterization follows from the strong correlation property, but it
is shown to be consistent with the existence of isomorphs in strongly
correlating liquids' phase diagram. Finally, we note that the FCS
characterization of simple liquids calls into question the basis for standard
perturbation theory, according to which the repulsive and attractive forces
play fundamentally different roles for the physics of liquids.

where an electron distribution function at the quantum Hall (QH) edge at
filling factor 2 has been measured with high precision. It has been reported
that the energy of electrons injected into one of the two chiral edge channels
with the help of a quantum point contact (QPC) is equally distributed between
them, in agreement with earlier predictions, one being based on the Fermi gas
approach, and the other utilizing the Luttinger liquid theory. We argue that
the physics of the energy relaxation process at the QH edge may in fact be more
rich, providing the possibility for discriminating between two physical
pictures in experiment. Namely, using the recently proposed non-equilibrium
bosonization technique we evaluate the electron distribution function and find
that the initial ""double-step"" distribution created at a QPC evolves through
several intermediate asymptotics, before reaching eventual equilibrium state.
At short distances the distribution function is found to be asymmetric due to
non-Gaussian current noise effects. At larger distances, where noise becomes
Gaussian, the distribution function acquires symmetric Lorentzian shape.
Importantly, in the regime of low QPC transparencies T the width of the
Lorentzian scales linearly with T, in contrast to the case of equilibrium Fermi
distribution, whose width scales as square root of T. Therefore, we propose to
do measurements at low QPC transparencies. We suggest that the missing energy
paradox may be explained by the nonlinear dispersion of the spectrum of edge
states.

behaviour, but not necessarily all quantum predictions. The amount of
contextuality can then be quantified in terms of additional resources needed as
compared with a similar model without contextuality. In this case the
contextual model needs to keep track of the context used, so the appropriate
measure would be memory. Another way to view this is as a memory requirement to
be able to reproduce quantum contextuality in a realist model. The model we
will use can be viewed as an extension of Spekkens' toy model [Phys. Rev. A 75,
032110 (2007)], and the relation is studied in some detail. To reproduce the
quantum predictions for the Peres-Mermin square, the memory requirement is more
than one bit in addition to the memory used for the individual outcomes in the
corresponding noncontextual model.

been investigated for equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases. If we consider a
small perturbation around the de Sitter space-time, the general conditions of
the validity of GSL have been found. Also if a phantom dominated Universe has a
polelike type scale factor, the validity of GSL has also been analyzed. Further
we have obtained constraints on the power-law parameter {\alpha} in the phantom

GSL breaks down in a cosmological background.

paradigm which was a dark matter assisted decelarating universe. The new model
introduces a dark energy driven accelarating universe though with a small
cosmological constant. The very next year this new picture was confirmed by the
Supernova observations of Perlmutter, Riess and Schmidt. These astronomers got

regardless of the state of conceptual understanding, without quantitative
reasoning Physics would have not reached the state of development it has today.
Correspondingly, quantitative reasoning and problem solving skills are a

supported by results from published research, we will show evidence that a well
structured problem solving strategy taught as a dynamical process offers a
feasible way for students to learn physics quantitatively and conceptually,

representation should follow a spatial approach, tying the structure used to
manage users with the structure used to manage information, suggesting the use
of different spaces to represent the information. The gain we expect from this
approach is the improved capacity to extract information on how people are
cooperating and their relationship with the information they are working with.
The ideas are introduced while focusing on real life emergency planning
activities, where we discuss the current shortcomings of the cooperation
strategies in use and propose a solution.

Sequential Function Charts (SFC), is a special class of Petri Nets and is
becoming the standard representation for sequential control systems. The
proposed framework accepts a graphical (through ISaGRAPH) or textual
behavioural specification of the control system to be implemented. It follows
the usual procedure in software specification: the first step is to formally
validate the initial specification. Then the initial specification is
translated through automated processes into an implementation. At the moment
there are two possible output languages: C and Palasm [1]. The target processor
for the C code language are microcontroller based systems that require extended
time constrains and access to external peripherals. The goal of including PLD's
