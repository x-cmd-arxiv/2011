homographic motion to exist, it is necessary that the space of motion be even

moment of inertia) and the space where the motion takes place is endowed with
an hermitian structure, or it is ""balanced"" (that is a critical point of the
potential among configurations with a given inertia spectrum) and the motion is
a new type, quasi-periodic, of relative equilibrium. Hip-Hops, which are
substitutes to the non-existing homographic solutions with odd dimensional

almost scale-invariant quantum fluctuations during inflation. We find that the
light modulus is generically produced by the inflaton decay and therefore a
prime candidate for the dark radiation. Interestingly, an almost
scale-invariant power spectrum predicted in the modulated reheating mechanism
gives a better fit to the observation in the presence of the extra radiation.

which evolves in rounds. Initially, there is a subset of infected nodes and in
each subsequent round each uninfected node which has at least $r$ infected
neighbours becomes infected and remains so forever. The parameter $r\geq 2$ is
fixed. Such processes have been used as models for the spread of ideas or
trends within a network of individuals.
  We analyse bootstrap percolation process in the case where the underlying
graph is an inhomogeneous random graph, which exhibits a power-law degree
distribution, and initially there are $a(n)$ randomly infected nodes. The main
focus of this paper is the number of vertices that will have been infected by
the end of the process. The main result of this work is that if the degree
sequence of the random graph follows a power law with exponent $\beta$, where
$2 < \beta < 3$, then a sublinear number of initially infected vertices is
enough to spread the infection over a linear fraction of the nodes of the
random graph, with high probability.
  More specifically, we determine explicitly a critical function $a_c(n)$ such
that $a_c(n)=o(n)$ with the following property. Assuming that $n$ is the number
of vertices of the underlying random graph, if $a(n) \ll a_c(n)$, then the
process does not evolve at all, with high probability as $n$ grows, whereas if
$a(n)\gg a_c(n)$, then there is a constant $\eps>0$ such that, with high
probability, the final set of infected vertices has size at least $\eps n$. It
turns out that when the maximum degree is $o(n^{1/(\beta -1)})$, then $a_c(n)$
depends also on $r$. But when the maximum degree is $\Theta (n^{1/(\beta
-1)})$, then $a_c (n)=n^{\beta -2 \over \beta -1}$.

measurements of the full counting statistics. At short times, the survival
probability exhibits deviations from the exponential law. The decay is governed
by the multi-particle Zeno time which exhibits a signature of quantum
statistics and contact interactions. The subsequent exponential regime governs
most of the dynamics, and we provide accurate analytical expressions for the
associated decay rates. Both dynamical regimes are illustrated in a realistic
model. Finally, a global picture of multi-particle quantum decay is presented.

sources without communication links among them. This paper is concerned with
the Wyner-Ziv problem: coding of an information source with side information
available only at the decoder in the form of a noisy version of the source.
Both the theoretical analysis and code design are addressed in the framework of
multi-dimensional nested lattice coding (NLC). For theoretical analysis,
accurate computation of the rate-distortion function is given under the
high-resolution assumption, and a new upper bound using the derivative of the
theta series is derived. For practical code design, several techniques with low
complexity are proposed. Compared to the existing Slepian-Wolf coded nested
quantization (SWC-NQ) for Wyner-Ziv coding based on one or two-dimensional
lattices, our proposed multi-dimensional NLC can offer better performance at
arguably lower complexity, since it does not require the second stage of
Slepian-Wolf coding.

infrastructures of fixed dimension. The algorithm applies to infrastructures
that satisfy certain conditions. The latter are always fulfilled for
infrastructures obtained from global fields, i.e., algebraic number fields and
function fields with finite constant fields.
  The first of our main contributions is an exponentially better method for
sampling approximations of vectors of the dual lattice of the period lattice
than the methods outlined in the works of Hallgren and Schmidt and Vollmer.
This new method improves the success probability by a factor of at least
2^{n^2-1} where n is the dimension. The second main contribution is a rigorous
and complete proof that the running time of the algorithm is polynomial in the
logarithm of the determinant of the period lattice and exponential in n. The
third contribution is the determination of an explicit lower bound on the
success probability of our algorithm which greatly improves on the bounds given
in the above works.
  The exponential scaling seems inevitable because the best currently known
methods for carrying out fundamental arithmetic operations in infrastructures
obtained from algebraic number fields take exponential time. In contrast, the
problem of computing the period lattice of infrastructures arising from
function fields can be solved without the exponential dependence on the
dimension n since this problem reduces efficiently to the abelian hidden
subgroup problem. This is also true for other important computational problems
in algebraic geometry. The running time of the best classical algorithms for
infrastructures arising from global fields increases subexponentially with the
determinant of the period lattice.

interest. This technique, called magnetofection, was initially developed mainly
to improve gene transfer in cell cultures, a simpler and more easily
controllable scenario than in vivo models. These studies provided evidence for
some unique capabilities of magnetofection. Progressively, the interest in
magnetofection expanded to its application in animal models and led to the
association of this technique with another technology, magnetic drug targeting
(MDT). This combination offers the possibility to develop more efficient and
less invasive gene therapy strategies for a number of major pathologies like
cancer, neurodegeneration and myocardial infarction. The goal of MDT is to
concentrate MNPs functionalized with therapeutic drugs, in target areas of the
body by means of properly focused external magnetic fields. The availability of
stable, nontoxic MNP-gene vector complexes now offers the opportunity to
develop magnetic gene targeting (MGT), a variant of MDT in which the gene
coding for a therapeutic molecule, rather than the molecule itself, is
delivered to a therapeutic target area in the body. This article will first
outline the principle of magnetofection, subsequently describing the properties
of the magnetic fields and MNPs used in this technique. Next, it will review
the results achieved by magnetofection in cell cultures. Last, the potential of
MGT for implementing minimally invasive gene therapy will be discussed.

that gave rise to the Jones polynomial, Jones' axiomatization of the standard
invariant of an extremal finite index $II_1$ subfactor as a spherical
$C^*$-planar algebra, presented in arXiv:math.QA/9909027, is the most elegant
and powerful description available. We make the natural extension of this
axiomatization to the case of finite index subfactors of arbitrary type. We
also provide the first steps toward a limited planar structure in the infinite
index case. The central role of rotations, which provide the main non-trivial
part of the planar structure, is a recurring theme throughout this work. In the
finite index case the axioms of a $C^*$-planar algebra need to be weakened to
disallow rotation of internal discs, giving rise to the notion of a rigid
$C^*$-planar algebra. We show that the standard invariant of any finite index
subfactor has a rigid $C^*$-planar algebra structure. We then show that
rotations can be re-introduced with associated correction terms entirely
controlled by the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the two canonical states on the
first relative commutant, $N' \cap M$. By deforming a rigid $C^*$-planar
algebra to obtain a spherical $C^*$-planar algebra and lifting the inverse
construction to the subfactor level we show that any rigid $C^*$-planar algebra
arises as the standard invariant of a finite index $II_1$ subfactor equipped
with a conditional expectation, which in general is not trace preserving.
Jones' results thus extend completely to the general finite index case. We
conclude by applying our machinery to the $II_1$ case, shedding new light on
the rotations studied by Huang [11] and touching briefly on the work of Popa

  reaction-diffusion systems","44 pages, embedded movie visible in at least Acrobat Reader",,,,"math.DS math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Similarity solutions play an important role in many fields of science: we
consider here similarity in stochastic dynamics. Important issues are not only
the existence of stochastic similarity, but also whether a similarity solution
is dynamically attractive, and if it is, to what particular solution does the
system evolve. By recasting a class of stochastic PDEs in a form to which
stochastic centre manifold theory may be applied we resolve these issues in
this class. For definiteness, a first example of self-similarity of the
Burgers' equation driven by some stochastic forced is studied. Under suitable
assumptions, a stationary solution is constructed which yields the existence of
a stochastic self-similar solution for the stochastic Burgers' equation.
Furthermore, the asymptotic convergence to the self-similar solution is proved.
Second, in more general stochastic reaction-diffusion systems stochastic centre
manifold theory provides a framework to construct the similarity solution,
confirm its relevance, and determines the correct solution for any compact
initial condition. Third, we argue that dynamically moving the spatial origin
and dynamically stretching time improves the description of the stochastic
similarity. Lastly, an application to an extremely simple model of turbulent
mixing shows how anomalous fluctuations may arise in eddy diffusivities. The
techniques and results we discuss should be applicable to a wide range of
stochastic similarity problems.

luminosities <4 10^{36} erg/s, a hot convective shell is formed around the
neutron star magnetosphere, and subsonic settling accretion regime sets in. In
this regime, accretion rate onto neutron star is determined by the ability of
plasma to enter magnetosphere via Rayleigh-Taylor instability. A gas-dynamic
theory of settling accretion is constructed taking into account anisotropic
turbulence. The angular momentum can be transferred through the quasi-static
shell via large-scale convective motions initiating turbulence cascade. The
angular velocity distribution in the shell is found depending on the turbulent
viscosity prescription. Comparison with observations of long-period X-ray
wind-fed pulsars shows that an almost iso-angular-momentum distribution is most
likely realized in their shells. The theory explains long-term spin-down in
wind- fed accreting pulsars (e.g. GX 1+4) and properties of short-term
torque-luminosity correlations. The theory can be applied to slowly rotating
low-luminosity X-ray pulsars and non-stationary accretion phenomena observed in

initially Maxwellian plasma is always dissipative because of the irreversible
acceleration of the electrons by the wave. Then, in the linear regime, the wave
packet is Landau damped, so that in the reference frame moving at the group
velocity, the wave amplitude decays exponentially with time. In the nonlinear
regime, once phase mixing has occurred and when the electron motion is nearly
adiabatic, the damping rate is strongly reduced compared to the Landau one, so
that the wave amplitude remains nearly constant along the characteristics. Yet,
we show here that the electrons are still globally accelerated by the wave
packet, and, in one dimension, this leads to a non local amplitude dependence
of the group velocity. As a result, a freely propagating wave packet would
shrink, and, therefore, so would its total energy. In more than one dimension,
not only does the magnitude of the group velocity nonlinearly vary, but also
its direction. In the weakly nonlinear regime, when the collisionless damping
rate is still significant compared to its linear value, this leads to an
effective defocussing effect which we quantify, and which we compare to the
self-focussing induced by wave front bowing.

range 12 + log O/H = 7.2-8.4. The Ne/O ratio increases with increasing oxygen
abundance. The Fe/O ratio decreases from roughly solar at the lowest
metallicities to about one tenth of solar, indicating that the degree of
depletion of iron into dust grains depends on metallicity. The N/O ratio in
extremely low-metallicity galaxies with 12+logO/H<7.5 shows a slight increase

host galaxy of a LRGB burst, to obtain its properties. Based on VLT/X-shooter
spectroscopic observations in the wavelength range 3200-24000A, we use standard
direct methods to evaluate physical conditions and element abundances. The
resolving power of the instrument also allowed us to trace the kinematics of
the ionised gas. We derive an interstellar oxygen abundance of
12+logO/H=8.20+/-0.03. The observed fluxes of hydrogen lines correspond to the
theoretical recombination values after correction for extinction with a single
value C(Hbeta)=1.67. We produce the CLOUDY photoionisation HII region model
that reproduces observed emission-line fluxes of different ions in the optical
range. This model also predicts emission-line fluxes in the near-infrared (NIR)
and mid-infrared (MIR) ranges that agree well with the observed ones. This
implies that the star-forming region observed in the optical range is the only
source of ionisation and there is no additional source of ionisation seen in
the NIR and MIR ranges that is hidden in the optical range.We find that the
heavy element abundances, Halpha luminosity, stellar mass, star-formation rate
and specific star-formation rate of HG 031203 are in the range that is covered
by the luminous compact galaxies (LCGs).This implies that the LCGs with extreme
star-formation that also comprise green pea galaxies as a subclass may harbour
LGRBs.

sufficiently sparse unknown signals from compressed linear measurements. In
fact, exact thresholds on the sparsity, as a function of the ratio between the
system dimensions, so that with high probability almost all sparse signals can
be recovered from i.i.d. Gaussian measurements, have been computed and are
referred to as ""weak thresholds"" \cite{D}. In this paper, we introduce a
reweighted $\ell_1$ recovery algorithm composed of two steps: a standard
$\ell_1$ minimization step to identify a set of entries where the signal is
likely to reside, and a weighted $\ell_1$ minimization step where entries
outside this set are penalized. For signals where the non-sparse component
entries are independent and identically drawn from certain classes of
distributions, (including most well known continuous distributions), we prove a
\emph{strict} improvement in the weak recovery threshold. Our analysis suggests
that the level of improvement in the weak threshold depends on the behavior of
the distribution at the origin. Numerical simulations verify the distribution
dependence of the threshold improvement very well, and suggest that in the case
of i.i.d. Gaussian nonzero entries, the improvement can be quite
impressive---over 20% in the example we consider.

produce better structure and viewing parameter estimates. This problem is often
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem, where data arises from
interest point matching. Mismatched interest points cause serious problems in
this approach, as a single mismatch will affect the entire reconstruction. In
this paper, we propose a novel robust Student's t BA algorithm (RST-BA). We
model reprojection errors using the heavy tailed Student's t-distribution, and
use an implicit trust region method to compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimate of the camera and viewing parameters in this model. The resulting
algorithm exploits the sparse structure essential for reconstructing
multi-image scenarios, has the same time complexity as standard L2 bundle
adjustment (L2-BA), and can be implemented with minimal changes to the standard
least squares framework. We show that the RST-BA is more accurate than either
L2-BA or L2-BA with a sigma-edit rule for outlier removal for a range of
simulated error generation scenarios. The new method has also been used to
reconstruct lunar topography using data from the NASA Apollo 15 orbiter, and we
present visual and quantitative comparisons of RST-BA and L2-BA methods for
this application. In particular, using the RST-BA algorithm we were able to
reconstruct a DEM from unprocessed data with many outliers and no ground
control points, which was not possible with the L2-BA method.

broad range of scales. Energy transfer may proceed either toward small scales
or in the reverse direction. The latter case is peculiar of two-dimensional
(2D) flows. Interestingly, a reversal of the energy flux is observed also in
three-dimensional (3D) geophysical flows under rotation and/or confined in thin
layers. The question is whether this phenomenon is enforced solely by external
anisotropic mechanisms or it is intimately embedded in the Navier-Stokes (NS)
equations. Here we show that an inverse energy cascade occurs also in 3D
isotropic flow. The flow is obtained from a suitable surgery of the NS
equations, keeping only triadic interactions between sign-defined helical
modes, preserving homogeneity and isotropy and breaking reflection invariance.
Our findings highlight the role played by helicity in the energy transfer
process and show that both 2D and 3D properties naturally coexist in all flows

This simple model of a gene circuit consists of two genes and three promotor
states. Either of the two protein products can dimerize, forming a repressor
molecule that binds to the promotor of the other gene. When the repressor is
bound to a promotor, the corresponding gene is not transcribed and no protein
is produced. Either one of the promotors can be repressed at any given time or
both can be unrepressed, leaving three possible promotor states. This model is
analysed in its bistable regime in which the deterministic limit exhibits two
stable fixed points and an unstable saddle, and the case of small noise is
considered. On small time scales, the stochastic process fluctuates near one of
the stable fixed points, and on large time scales, a metastable transition can
occur, where fluctuations drive the system past the unstable saddle to the
other stable fixed point. To explore how different intrinsic noise sources
affect these transitions, fluctuations in protein production and degradation
are eliminated, leaving fluctuations in the promotor state as the only source
of noise in the system. Perturbation methods are then used to compute the
stability landscape and the distribution of transition times, or first exit
time density. To understand how protein noise affects the system, small
magnitude fluctuations are added back into the process, and the stability
landscape is compared to that of the process without protein noise. It is found
that significant differences in the random process emerge in the presence of
protein noise.

present a result by Terhal and Burkard [TB05] and later improved upon by
Aliferis, Gottesman and Preskill [AGP06] that shows a threshold can still be
obtained for local non-Markovian noise, where we allow the noise to be weakly
correlated in space and time. We then turn to negative results, presenting work
by Ben-Aroya and Ta-Shma [BT11] who showed conditional errors cannot be
perfectly corrected. We end our survey by briefly mentioning some more
speculative objections, as put forth by Kalai [Kal08, Kal09, Kal11].

yield conflicting values for the matter density at a space-time point. We

from the wave function psi on the past light cone of x by setting the i-th
particle position in |psi|^2 equal to x, integrating over the other particle
positions, and averaging over i. We show that the predictions that follow from

complexity from simple bacterial genomes to complex mammalian genomes and
compared the results to the majority voting procedure used by many other
