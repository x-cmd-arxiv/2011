  elliptically polarized light",,,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known from numerical and experimental results that the fraction of
Rydberg states (excited neutral atoms) created by tunnel ionization declines
dramatically with increasing ellipticity of laser light. We present a method to
analyze this dependence on ellipticity, deriving a probability distribution of
Rydberg states that agrees closely with recent experimental [1] and numerical
results. In particular, contradicting the existing proposed mechanism [1] and
general expectations, our results indicate that the dependence of Rydberg yield
on laser ellipticity is not caused by a rescattering process. Rather, we show
that most Rydberg electrons never come back to the vicinity of the exit point
after ionization, and end up relatively far from the atom (compared to the exit
point) after the laser pulse has passed. We also present experimental data
revealing a bifurcation that corresponds to a cut-off in Rydberg generation,
and present an analytic derivation with a perturbative inclusion of the Coloumb
force. [1] T. Nubbemeyer, K. Gorling, A. Saenz, U. Eichmann, and W. Sandner,

and outline the development of new algorithms in this context. We provide a
characterization theorem, a theorem which gives conditions for a martingale to
be surely optimal, and a stability theorem concerning martingales which are
near to be surely optimal in a sense. Guided by these results we develop a
framework of backward algorithms for constructing such a martingale. In turn
this martingale may then be utilized for computing an upper bound of the
Bermudan product. The methodology is pure dual in the sense that it doesn't
require certain input approximations to the Snell envelope. In an It\^o-L\'evy
environment we outline a particular regression based backward algorithm which
allows for computing dual upper bounds without nested Monte Carlo simulation.
Moreover, as a by-product this algorithm also provides approximations to the
continuation values of the product, which in turn determine a stopping policy.
Hence, we may obtain lower bounds at the same time. In a first numerical study
we demonstrate the backward dual regression algorithm in a Wiener environment
at well known benchmark examples. It turns out that the method is at least
comparable to the one in Belomestny et. al. (2009) regarding accuracy, but
regarding computational robustness there are even several advantages.

intrinsically unpredictable if they violate a Bell inequality. This property
can be used to generate certified randomness in a device-independent way, i.e.,
without making detailed assumptions about the internal working of the quantum
devices used to generate the random numbers. Furthermore these numbers are also
private, i.e., they appear random not only to the user, but also to any
adversary that might possess a perfect description of the devices. Since this
process requires a small initial random seed, one usually speaks of
device-independent randomness expansion.
  The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we point out that in most real,
practical situations, where the concept of device-independence is used as a
protection against unintentional flaws or failures of the quantum apparatuses,
it is sufficient to show that the generated string is random with respect to an
adversary that holds only classical-side information, i.e., proving randomness
against quantum-side information is not necessary. Furthermore, the initial
random seed does not need to be private with respect to the adversary, provided
that it is generated in a way that is independent from the measured systems.
The devices, though, will generate cryptographically-secure randomness that
cannot be predicted by the adversary and thus one can, given access to free
public randomness, talk about private randomness generation.
  The theoretical tools to quantify the generated randomness according to these
criteria were already introduced in [S. Pironio et al, Nature 464, 1021
(2010)], but the final results were improperly formulated. The second aim of
this paper is to correct this inaccurate formulation and therefore lay out a
precise theoretical framework for practical device-independent randomness
expansion.

measurement could provide information about the density dependence of the
symmetry energy which is a crucial quantity in nuclear physics. Secondly, the
information on the nucleon potential obtained from the analysis of the

closing of ion channels (channel noise) with the non-linear neural dynamics are
essential to our understanding of the operation of the nervous system. The
effects that channel noise can have on neural dynamics are generally studied
using numerical simulations of stochastic models. Algorithms based on discrete
Markov Chains (MC) seem to be the most reliable and trustworthy, but even
optimized algorithms come with a non-negligible computational cost. Diffusion
Approximation (DA) methods use Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to
approximate the behavior of a number of MCs, considerably speeding up
simulation times. However, model comparisons have suggested that DA methods did
not lead to the same results as in MC modeling in terms of channel noise
statistics and effects on excitability. Recently, it was shown that the
difference arose because MCs were modeled with coupled activation subunits,
while the DA was modeled using uncoupled activation subunits. Implementations
of DA with coupled subunits, in the context of a specific kinetic scheme,
yielded similar results to MC. However, it remained unclear how to generalize
these implementations to different kinetic schemes, or whether they were faster
than MC algorithms. Additionally, a steady state approximation was used for the
stochastic terms, which, as we show here, can introduce significant
inaccuracies. We derived the SDE explicitly for any given ion channel kinetic
scheme. The resulting generic equations were surprisingly simple and
interpretable - allowing an easy and efficient DA implementation. The algorithm
was tested in a voltage clamp simulation and in two different current clamp
simulations, yielding the same results as MC modeling. Also, the simulation
efficiency of this DA method demonstrated considerable superiority over MC
methods.

non-variable chemically peculiar (CP) stars for a long time. However, recent
discoveries of the variability in spectral line profiles have suggested an
inhomogeneous surface distribution of chemical elements in some HgMn stars.
From the studies of other CP stars it is known that magnetic field plays a key
role in the formation of surface spots. All attempts to find magnetic fields in
HgMn stars have yielded negative results. In this study, we investigate the
possible presence of a magnetic field in phi Phe (HD 11753) and reconstruct
surface distribution of chemical elements that show variability in spectral
lines.We also test a hypothesis that a magnetic field is concentrated in
chemical spots and look into the possibility that some chemical elements are
stratified with depth in the stellar atmosphere. Our analysis is based on
high-quality spectropolarimetric time-series observations, covering a full
rotational period of the star. Spectra were obtained with the HARPSpol at the
ESO 3.6-m telescope. Combining information from all suitable spectral lines, we
set an upper limit of 4 G on the mean longitudinal magnetic field. For chemical
spots, an upper limit on the longitudinal field varies between 8 and 15 G. We
confirmed the variability of Y, Sr, and Ti and detected variability in Cr
lines. Stratification analysis showed that Y and Ti are not concentrated in the
uppermost atmospheric layers. Our spectropolarimetric observations rule out the
presence of a strong, globally-organised magnetic field in phi Phe. This
implies an alternative mechanism of spot formation, which could be related to a
non-equilibrium atomic diffusion. However, the typical time scales of the
variation in stratification predicted by the recent time-dependent diffusion
models exceed significantly the spot evolution time-scale reported for phi Phe.

Milky Way ([Ba/Y]$>+0.5$) and increases with decreasing age, indicating a
strong contribution of low-metallicity AGB star ejecta to the interstellar
medium throughout the later history of the LMC. We also find a correlation of

massive, older clusters are enriched in the light elements Na and Al with

the surface-Brillouin-zone center crossing the Fermi energy. We explain this
trend based on the oscillations, with film thickness, of the decay length on
the vacuum side of the quantum-well states at the Fermi energy. Contrary to
previous suggestions, we find that the actual oscillations with film thickness
of the density of states per atom of the film at the Fermi energy cannot
account for the observed trend in the chemisorption energy.

The truncation is based on an Ansatz for the Coulomb kernel occurring in the

both the Yang-Mills and quark sectors. It is found that the resulting equations
for the static gluon and quark propagators agree with those derived in a
quasi-particle approximation to the canonical Hamiltonian approach. Moreover, a

usually difficult to quantify with limited knowledge of how the plant that we

that the reduced dynamics of the plant attached to a non-Markovian bath becomes
indistinguishable from the one with a Markovian bath, if we left the entire

applying local unitary operations on the plant-they will influence the plant

introducing more gaps to the structure. This approach allows for simple and

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose a framework for solving constrained online convex
optimization problem. Our motivation stems from the observation that most
algorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto
the convex set $\mathcal{K}$ from which the decisions are made. While for
simple shapes (e.g. Euclidean ball) the projection is straightforward, for
arbitrary complex sets this is the main computational challenge and may be
inefficient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online
convex optimization problem. Instead of requiring decisions belong to
$\mathcal{K}$ for all rounds, we only require that the constraints which define
the set $\mathcal{K}$ be satisfied in the long run. We show that our framework
can be utilized to solve a relaxed version of online learning with side
constraints addressed in \cite{DBLP:conf/colt/MannorT06} and
\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KvetonYTM08}. By turning the problem into an online
convex-concave optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm which
achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ bound for the violation of constraints. Then we
modify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied
in the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on
the Mirror Prox method \citep{nemirovski-2005-prox} to solve variational
inequalities which achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}}(T^{2/3})$ bound for
both regret and the violation of constraints when the domain $\K$ can be
described by a finite number of linear constraints. Finally, we extend the
result to the setting where we only have partial access to the convex set
$\mathcal{K}$ and propose a multipoint bandit feedback algorithm with the same
bounds in expectation as our first algorithm.

peer maintains both semantic mappings between its schema and some

reformulating a query from a peer's schema into other peer's schemas is a hard
problem, as it may generate as many rewritings as the set of mappings from that
peer to the outside and transitively on, by eventually traversing the entire
network. However, not all the obtained rewritings are relevant to a given
query. In this paper, we address this problem by inspecting semantic mappings

'relevance' of a query with respect to a mapping, and, based on this notion, a
new semantic query reformulation approach for social PDMS, which achieves great
accuracy and flexibility. To find rapidly the most interesting mappings, we
combine several techniques: (i) social links are expressed as FOAF (Friend of a
Friend) links to characterize peer's friendship and compact mapping summaries
are used to obtain mapping descriptions; (ii) local semantic views are special
views that contain information about external mappings; and (iii) gossiping
techniques improve the search of relevant mappings. Our experimental

introduced in some of new physics models at the TeV scale. We here consider the
two Higgs doublet model with the Type-X Yukawa interaction, where nonstandard
Higgs bosons predominantly decay into tau leptons. These extra Higgs bosons can
be pair produced via s-channel gauge boson mediation at hadron colliders; q
\bar q \to Z \to HA and q \bar q' \to W^\pm \to HH^\pm (AH^\pm), where H, A and
H^\pm are CP-even, odd and charged Higgs bosons, respectively. Consequently,
multi-tau-lepton originated signals appear in the final state as a promising
signature of such a model. We find that the main background can be considerably
reduced by requiring the high multiplicity of leptons and tau-jets with
appropriate kinematical cuts in the final state. Thus, assuming the integrated
luminosity of a hundred of inverse fb, the excess can be seen in various three-
and four-lepton channels. With the integrated luminosity of thousands of
inverse fb, the determination of the mass as well as ratios of leptonic decay
branching ratios of these Higgs bosons would also be possible.

In these proceedings, we revisit the standard procedure to match
non-perturbative models to perturbative QCD, using experimental data. The
strong coupling constant plays a central role in the QCD evolution of parton
densities. We will extend this procedure with a non-perturbative generalization

the negative result of the XENON100 dark matter search has excluded (at 90% CL)
values of the spin-independent scattering cross sections sigma^SI_p as low as
10^-8 pb. We incorporate these improved experimental constraints into a global
Bayesian fit of the Constrained MSSM by constructing approximate likelihood
functions. In the case of the alphaT limit, we simulate detector efficiency for
the CMS alphaT 1.1/fb and validate our method against the official 95% CL
contour. We identify the 68% and 95% credible posterior regions of the CMSSM
parameters, and also find the best-fit point. We find that the credible regions
change considerably once a likelihood from alphaT is included, in particular
the narrow light Higgs resonance region becomes excluded, but the focus
point/horizontal branch region remains allowed at the 1sigma level. Adding the
limit from XENON100 has a weaker additional effect, in part due to large
uncertainties in evaluating sigma^SI_p, which we include in a conservative way,
although we find that it reduces the posterior probability of the focus point
region to the 2sigma level. The new regions of high posterior favor squarks
lighter than the gluino and all but one Higgs bosons heavy. The dark matter
neutralino mass is found in the range 250 GeV <~ m_Chi1 <~ 343 GeV (at 1sigma)

slightly with the other at about 24 TW, and together spanning 14-46 TW.
Approximately 20 % of this radioactive power (3-8 TW) escapes to space in the
form of geo-neutrinos. The remaining 11-38 TW heats the planet with significant
geo-dynamical consequences, appearing as the radiogenic component of the 43-49
TW surface heat flow. The non-radiogenic component of the surface heat flow
(5-38 TW) is presumably primordial, a legacy of the formation and early
evolution of the planet. A constraining measurement of radiogenic heating
provides insights to the thermal history of the Earth and potentially
discriminates chemical and physical Earth models. Radiogenic heating in the
planet primarily springs from unstable nuclides of uranium, thorium, and
potassium. The paths to their stable daughter nuclides include nuclear beta
decays, producing geo-neutrinos. Large sub-surface detectors efficiently record
the energy but not the direction of the infrequent interactions of the highest
energy geo-neutrinos, originating only from uranium and thorium. The measured
energy spectrum of the interactions estimates the relative amounts of these
heat-producing elements, while the intensity estimates planetary radiogenic
power. Recent geo-neutrino observations in Japan and Italy find consistent
values of radiogenic heating. The combined result mildly excludes the lowest
model values of radiogenic heating and, assuming whole mantle convection,
identifies primordial heat loss. Future observations have the potential to
measure radiogenic heating with better precision, further constraining
geological models and the thermal evolution of the Earth.

scalar on $R^{3}\times S^{1}$ using semiclassical methods. There are two global
symmetries: a $Z(2)_{H}$ symmetry associated with the Higgs field and a
$Z(2)_{C}$ center symmetry. We analyze the order of the deconfining phase
transition when different deformation terms are used. After finding order
parameters for the global symmetries, we show that there are four distinct
phases: a deconfined phase, a confined phase, a Higgs phase, and a mixed
confined phase. The mixed confined phase occurs where one might expect a phase
in which there is both confinement and the Higgs mechanism, but the behavior of
the order parameters distinguishes the two phases. In the mixed confined phase,
the $Z(2)_{C}\times Z(2)_{H}$ global symmetry breaks spontaneously to a Z(2)
subgroup that acts non-trivially on both the scalar field and the Polyakov
loop. We find explicitly the BPS and KK monopole solutions of the Euclidean
field equations in the BPS limit. In the mixed phase, a linear combination of
$\phi$ and $A_{4}$ enters into the monopole solutions. In all four phases,
Wilson loops orthogonal to the compact direction are expected to show area-law
behavior. We show that this confining behavior can be attributed to a dilute
monopole gas in a broad region that includes portions of all four phases. A
duality argument similar to that applied recently [Poppitz and Unsal, 2011] to
the Seiberg-Witten model on $R^3 \times S^1$ shows that the monopole gas
picture, arrived at using Euclidean instanton methods, can be interpreted as a
gas of finite-energy dyons.

spectrographs (IFS) to facilitate the detection and characterization of faint
substellar companions. Algorithms currently envisioned to handle IFS data, such
as the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) algorithm, rely upon
aggressive point-spread-function (PSF) subtraction, which is ideal for
initially identifying companions but results in significantly biased photometry
and spectroscopy due to unwanted mixing with residual starlight. This
spectro-photometric issue is further complicated by the fact that algorithmic
color response is a function of the companion's spectrum, making it difficult
to calibrate the effects of the reduction without using iterations involving a
series of injected synthetic companions. In this paper, we introduce a new PSF
calibration method, which we call ""damped LOCI"", that seeks to alleviate these
concerns. By modifying the cost function that determines the weighting
coefficients used to construct PSF reference images, and also forcing those
coefficients to be positive, it is possible to extract companion spectra with a
precision that is set by calibration of the instrument response and
transmission of the atmosphere, and not by post-processing. We demonstrate the
utility of this approach using on-sky data obtained with the Project 1640 IFS
at Palomar. Damped-LOCI does not require any iterations on the underlying
spectral type of the companion, nor does it rely upon priors involving the
chromatic and statistical properties of speckles. It is a general technique
that can readily be applied to other current and planned instruments that
employ IFS's.

underlying the ob- served phenomenology is magnetized to some extent. Within
this context, radiative signatures of dissipation of kinetic and conversion of
magnetic energy in internal shocks of relativistic magnetized outflows are
studied. We model internal shocks as being caused by collisions of homogeneous
plasma shells. We compute the flow state after the shell interaction by solving
Riemann problems at the contact surface between the colliding shells, and then
compute the emission from the resulting shocks. Under the assumption of a
constant flow luminosity we find that there is a clear difference between the
models where both shells are weakly magne- tized ({\sigma}<\sim0.01) and those
where, at least, one shell has a {\sigma}>\sim0.01. We obtain that the
radiative efficiency is largest for models in which, regardless of the
ordering, one shell is weakly and the other strongly magnetized. Substantial
differences between weakly and strongly magne- tized shell collisions are
observed in the inverse-Compton part of the spectrum, as well as in the
optical, X-ray and 1GeV light curves. We propose a way to distinguish
observationally between weakly magnetized from magnetized internal shocks by
comparing the maximum frequency of the inverse-Compton and synchrotron part of
the spectrum to the ratio of the inverse-Compton and synchrotron fluence.
Finally, our results suggest that LBL blazars may correspond to barely
magnetized flows, while HBL blazars could correspond to moderately magnetized
ones. Indeed, by comparing with actual blazar observations we conclude that the
magnetization of typical blazars is {\sigma} <\sim 0.01 for the internal shock
model to be valid in these sources.

three peculiar transients (PTF09dav, PTF10iuv, PTF11bij) with five
distinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae and
supernovae (M_R = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time
~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), early
spectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiar
nebular spectra dominated by Calcium. We also culled the extensive decade-long
Lick Observatory Supernova Search database and identified an additional member
of this group, SN 2007ke. Our choice of photometric and spectroscopic
properties was motivated by SN 2005E (Perets et al. 2010). To our surprise, as
in the case of SN 2005E, all four members of this group are also clearly offset
from the bulk of their host galaxy. Given the well-sampled early and late-time
light curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 Msun.
Spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photospheric
phase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. Our extensive
follow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standard
core-collapse explosions for this class of ""Calcium-rich gap"" transients. If
the progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the white
dwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejected
nova shell. In the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a very
non-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to be
invoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). Detection (or
lack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide a
crucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

elliptical galaxy, hosting a massive and dense nucleus. Our aim is to
investigate the regular or chaotic character of the motion, with emphasis in
the different chaotic components, as well as the sticky regions of the
dynamical system. In order to define the character of the motion in the 2D
system, we use the classical method of the Poincare x-px phase plane, the
Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent (LCE) and the dynamical parameter - the S(c)
spectrum. Then the results obtained from the 2D system are used to investigate
the properties of the 3D system. For this, we introduce and use a new dynamical
parameter, the S(k) spectrum, which proves to be a very reliable and fast
method to detect the islandic motion and the evolution of the sticky orbits in
the 3D system. Numerical experiments conducted by the new S(k) spectrum suggest
that the different chaotic components in the 3D system do not interact for time
intervals much larger than the age of the galaxy. The results indicate that the
different sticky regions do not lead to a unified chaotic sea. Thus, the
behavior of the 3D sticky orbits differs from that observed in the 2D system.
Furthermore, the 3D motion near the center of a triaxial elliptical galaxy
seems to be very complicated, displaying several families of resonant orbits,
different chaotic components and sticky regions, while only a small fraction of
orbits is regular. The comparison with earlier results reveals the importance
of the conception of the new dynamical spectrum.

Universal power-law distributions, previously found within a nonperturbative
quantum-field theoretical approach and recently shown to be related to vortical
dynamics and superfluid turbulence [Phys. Rev. B 84, 020506(R) (2011)], are
studied in detail. The results imply an interpretation of the scaling behavior
in terms of independent vortex excitations of the superfluid and show that the
statistics of topological excitations can be described in the framework of wave
turbulence. The particular scaling exponents observed in the single-particle
momentum distributions are found to be consistent with irreversibility as well
as conservation laws obeyed by the wave interactions. Moreover, long-wavelength
acoustic excitations of the vortex-bearing condensate, driven by vortex
annihilations, are found to follow a nonthermal power law. Considering vortex
correlations in a statistical model, the long-time departure from the
nonthermal fixed point is related to vortex-antivortex pairing. The studied
nonthermal fixed points are accessible in cold-gas experiments. The results
shed light on fundamental aspects of superfluid turbulence and have strong

$\phi$, serves as a source of strain incompatibility and screens long-ranged
elastic interactions. It is produced wherever the local stress exceeds a
threshold and anneals diffusively thereafter. A description in terms of $\phi$
is inevitable when the separation between defect pairs, possibly generated
during the course of the transformation, is small. Using a variational
calculation, we find three types of stable solutions ({\hv I}, {\hv II} and
{\hv III}) for the structure of the product droplet depending on the scaled
mobilities of $\phi$ parallel and perpendicular to the parent-product interface

$l\propto\sqrt{W}$ in solution {\hv I}, this relation does not hold for {\hv

obvious implication is that SRPs produced by extraterrestrial civilizations
should have arrived in our solar system millions of years ago, and furthermore,
that new probes from an ever-arising supply of civilizations ought to be
arriving on a constant basis. The lack of observations of such probes underlies
a frequently cited variation of the Fermi Paradox. We believe that a
predilection for ETI-optimistic theories has deterred consideration of
incompatible theories. Notably, SRPs have virtually disappeared from the
literature. In this paper, we consider the most common arguments against SRPs
and find those arguments lacking. By extension, we find recent models of
galactic exploration which explicitly exclude SRPs to be unfairly handicapped
and unlikely to represent natural scenarios.
  We also consider several other models that seek to explain the Fermi Paradox,
most notably percolation theory and two societal-collapse theories. In the
former case, we find that it imposes unnatural assumptions which likely render
it unrealistic. In the latter case, we present a new theory of interstellar
transportation bandwidth which calls into question the validity of
societal-collapse theories.

reconstruction are observed to occur at the structural (TS) and magnetic (TSDW)
transitions. At TS, C4 rotational symmetry is broken in the form of an
anisotropic shift of the orthogonal dxz and dyz bands. The magnitude of this
orbital anisotropy rapidly develops to near completion upon approaching TSDW,
at which temperature band folding occurs via the antiferromagnetic ordering
wave vector. Interestingly, the anisotropic band shift onsetting at TS develops
in such a way to enhance the nesting conditions in the C2 symmetric state,
hence is intimately correlated with the long range collinear AFM order.
Furthermore, the similar behaviors of the electronic reconstruction in NaFeAs

anisotropy between TS and TSDW is likely a general feature of the electronic
nematic phase in the iron pnictides, and the associated orbital fluctuations

leakage current can be reduced more effectively than the conventional single
gate transistors with the same band gap size due to a high barrier height and a
long tunneling length in the nanoribbon. The on state is obtained by flipping
the polarity of the bias of either top gate to form a P-I-P or N-I-N junction.
An experiment showed that the drain current was suppressed in the cases of
P-I-N and N-I-P compared to the cases of P-I-P and N-I-N, and all of the
behaviors were consistent with what was expected from the device operation
model.

breathing oscillations whose amplitudes are suppressed by self trapping, due to

the damping of breathing oscillations and non-Markovian dynamics of the width
of the impurity, the degree of which can be engineered through controllable
parameters. Our results reproduce the main features of the impurity dynamics
observed by Catani et al. despite experimental thermal effects, and are
supported by simulations of the system in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime.

began to abound. Physicists began to speak of a new ""crisis"" and envisage a
forthcoming ""revolution"" of a scale similar to the one in the mid-1920s. The
perceived crisis was an issue not only in microphysics but also in cosmology,
where it resulted in ambitious cosmophysical theories that transcended the
ordinary methods of physics. The uncertain cognitive situation was, in some
circles, associated to the uncertain political and moral situation. Did the
problems of foundational physics demand a revolution in thinking that somehow
paralleled the political revolutions of the time? I argue that although such
ideas were indeed discussed in the 1930s, they were more rhetoric than reality.
With the benefit of hindsight one can see that the perceived crisis was only

Resistance
can occur due to mutations that were present before treatment starts or due to
mutations that occur during treatment. The relative importance of these two
sources is unknown. We study three different situations in which HIV drug
resistance may evolve: starting triple-drug therapy, treatment with a single
dose of nevirapine and interruption of treatment. For each of these three cases
good data are available from literature, which allows us to estimate the
probability that resistance evolves from standing genetic variation. Depending
on the treatment we find probabilities of the evolution of drug resistance due
to standing genetic variation between 0 and 39%. For patients who start
triple-drug combination therapy, we find that drug resistance evolves from
standing genetic variation in approximately 6% of the patients. We use a
population-dynamic and population-genetic model to understand the observations
and to estimate important evolutionary parameters. We find that both, the
effective population size of the virus before treatment, and the fitness of the
resistant mutant during treatment, are key-parameters that determine the
probability that resistance evolves from standing genetic variation.
Importantly, clinical data indicate that both of these parameters can be
manipulated by the kind of treatment that is used.

calculations and electrostatic modeling which elucidate the origin of the 1DEG
as an electronic reconstruction to compensate a net surface charge in the step

these electronic interfaces.

Using the total momentum shift
operator to construct the perturbed many-body Hamiltonian and ground state wave
function the second derivative of the ground state energy with respect to the
perturbing field is expressed in terms of the one and two-body momentum
densities. The distinction between the adiabatic and envelope function
derivatives, hence that between the Drude and superfluid weights can be
introduced in a straightforward manner. It is shown that a discontinuity in the
momentum density leads to a contribution to the Drude weight, but not the
superfluid weight, however a $\delta$-function contribution in the two-body
momentum density (such as in the BCS wave-funtion) contributes to both
quantities. The connection between the discontinuity in the momentum density
and localization is also demonstrated.

ability of the detector to distinguish multiple radioactive sources observed
simultaneously is investigating by simulating point-like sources of different

communication technology (QICT). The entanglement thus far explored and applied
to QICT has been pure and distillable entanglement. Yet there is another type
of entanglement, called 'bound entanglement', which is not distillable by local
operations and classical communication (LOCC). We demonstrate the experimental
'activation' of the bound entanglement held in the four-qubit Smolin state,
unleashing its immanent entanglement in distillable form, with the help of
auxiliary two-qubit entanglement and LOCC. We anticipate that it opens the way
to a new class of QICT applications that utilize more general classes of
entanglement than ever, including bound entanglement.

last two decades many groups have been working on the dynamics of the magnetic
moment in nanomagnetic materials at low temperatures, it giving rise to the
observation of quantum relaxations and quantum hysteresis cycles. For the first

vortex core through pinning barriers, which are associated to structural
defects in the dots, towards its equilibrium position.

was employed in this study for dot-plot comparison of human and primate
genomes. The detection of extended conserved synteny regions was based on
continuous fuzzy similarity rather than on chains of discrete anchors (genes or
highly conserved noncoding elements). In addition to the high correspondence
found in the comparisons of whole-genome sequences, a good similarity was also
found after masking gene sequences, indicating that CS analysis manages to
reveal phylogenetic signal in the organization of noncoding part of the genome
sequences, including repetitive DNA and the genome ""dark matter"". Obviously,
the possibility to reveal parallel ordering depends on the signal of common
ancestor sequence organization varying locally along the corresponding segments
of the compared genomes. We explored two sources contributing to this signal:
sequence composition (GC content) and sequence organization (abundances of
k-mers in the usual A,T,G,C or purine-pyrimidine alphabets). Whole-genome
comparisons based on GC distribution along the analyzed sequences indeed gives
reasonable results, but combining it with k-mer abundances dramatically
improves the ordering quality, indicating that compositional and organizational
heterogeneity comprise complementary sources of information on evolutionary
conserved similarity of genome sequences.
