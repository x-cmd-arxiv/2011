liquid crystals, we study the effect of adding a non-adsorbing ideal depletant
on the phase behavior of colloidal hard boardlike particles. We take into
account the presence of the depletant by introducing an effective depletion
attraction between a pair of boardlike particles. At fixed depletant fugacity,
the stable liquid crystal phase is determined through a mean-field theory with
restricted orientations. Interestingly, we predict that for slightly elongated
boardlike particles a critical depletant density exists, where the system
undergoes a direct transition from an isotropic liquid to a biaxial nematic
phase. As a consequence, by tuning the depletant density, an easy experimental
control parameter, one can stabilize states of high biaxial nematic order even
when these states are unstable for pure systems of boardlike particles.

  arXiv:1002.3576",,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High harmonic generation by relativistically intense laser pulses from
overdense plasma layers is surveyed. High harmonics are generated in form of
(sub-)attosecond pulses when the plasma surface rebounds towards the observer
with relativistic velocity. Different cases are considered. The
""relativistically oscillating mirror"" (ROM) model, describing the most typical
case, is analyzed in detail. The resulting harmonic spectrum is usually a power
law with the exponent -8/3 [baeva2006relativistic], but possible exceptions due
to ""higher order \gamma-spikes"" are considered. It is shown that under certain
conditions, ultra-dense electron nanobunches can be formed at plasma surface
that emit coherent synchrotron radiation. The resulting spectrum is much
flatter and leads to the formation of a giant attosecond pulse in the reflected
radiation. The harmonics radiation is also considered in time domain, where
they form a train of attosecond pulses. It is characterized and a possibility
to select a single attosecond pulse via polarization gating is described.
Further, the line structure in relativistic harmonic spectra is analyzed. It is
shown that the harmonics have an intrinsic chirp and it can be responsible for
experimentally observed spectral modulations. Finally, high harmonic generation
is considered in realistic three-dimensional geometry. It is shown that free
space diffraction can act as a high pass filter, altering the spectrum and the
reflected field structure. The high harmonics tend to be self-focused by the
reflecting surface. This leads to a natural angular divergence as well as to
field boost at the focal position. Coherently focusing the harmonics using an
optimized geometry may result in a significantly higher field than the field of
the driving laser.

atmosphere. In magnetic waveguides resonant absorption due to plasma
inhomogeneity naturally transfers wave energy from large-scale motions to
small-scale motions. In the cooler parts of the solar atmosphere as, e.g., the
chromosphere, effects due to partial ionization may be relevant for wave
dynamics and heating. Aims. We study resonant Alfven waves in partially ionized
plasmas. Methods. We use the multifluid equations in the cold plasma
approximation. We investigate propagating resonant MHD waves in partially
ionized flux tubes. We use approximate analytical theory based on normal modes
in the thin tube and thin boundary approximations along with numerical
eigenvalue computations. Results. We find that the jumps of the wave
perturbations across the resonant layer are the same as in fully ionized
plasmas. The damping length due to resonant absorption is inversely
proportional to the frequency, while that due to ion-neutral collisions is
inversely proportional to the square of the frequency. For observed frequencies
in the solar atmosphere, the amplitude of MHD kink waves is more efficiently
damped by resonant absorption than by ion-neutral collisions. Conclusions. Most
of the energy carried by chromospheric kink waves is converted into localized
azimuthal Alfven waves that can deposit energy in the coronal medium. The
dissipation of wave energy in the chromosphere due to ion-neutral collisions is
only effective for high-frequency waves. The chromosphere acts as a filter for
kink waves with periods shorter than 10 s.

further confirmed by disordering the arrays, a case in which large transmission
losses appear due to extinction by resonant scattering from the particles.
Therefore, these composites although little absorbing have large extinction due
to scattering.

similar resonant mode in the non-superconducting, antiferromagnetically ordered
heavy-fermion metal CeB6. Unlike conventional magnons, the mode is
non-dispersive, and its intensity is sharply concentrated around a wave vector
separate from those characterizing the antiferromagnetic order. The magnetic
intensity distribution rather suggests that the mode is associated with a
coexisting order parameter of the unusual antiferro-quadrupolar phase of CeB6,
which has long remained ""hidden"" to the neutron-scattering probes. The mode
energy increases continuously below the onset temperature for
antiferromagnetism, in parallel to the opening of a nearly isotropic spin gap
throughout the Brillouin zone. These attributes bear strong similarity to those
of the resonant modes observed in unconventional superconductors below their
critical temperatures. This unexpected commonality between the two disparate
ground states indicates the dominance of itinerant spin dynamics in the ordered
low-temperature phases of CeB6 and throws new light on the interplay between
antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and ""hidden"" order parameters in

output variability in systems with parametric uncertainty. Traditional
algorithms for UQ are either system-agnostic and slow (such as Monte Carlo) or
fast with stringent assumptions on smoothness (such as polynomial chaos and
Quasi-Monte Carlo). In this work, we develop a fast UQ approach for hybrid
dynamical systems by extending the polynomial chaos methodology to these
systems. To capture discontinuities, we use a wavelet-based Wiener-Haar
expansion. We develop a boundary layer approach to propagate uncertainty
through separable reset conditions. We also introduce a transport theory based
approach for propagating uncertainty through hybrid dynamical systems. Here the
expansion yields a set of hyperbolic equations that are solved by integrating
along characteristics. The solution of the partial differential equation along
the characteristics allows one to quantify uncertainty in hybrid or switching
dynamical systems. The above methods are demonstrated on example problems.

stars or magnetars is one of the most valuable tools to gain insight into the
physical processes occurring in their interiors and magnetospheres. In
particular, the magnetospheric plasma leaves a strong imprint on the observed
X-ray spectrum by means of Compton up-scattering of the thermal radiation
coming from the star surface. Motivated by the increased quality of the
observational data, much theoretical work has been devoted to develop Monte
Carlo (MC) codes that incorporate the effects of resonant Compton scattering in
the modeling of radiative transfer of photons through the magnetosphere. The
two key ingredients in this simulations are the kinetic plasma properties and
the magnetic field (MF) configuration. The MF geometry is expected to be
complex, but up to now only mathematically simple solutions (self-similar
solutions) have been employed. In this work, we discuss the effects of new,
more realistic, MF geometries on synthetic spectra. We use new force-free
solutions in a previously developed MC code to assess the influence of MF
geometry on the emerging spectra. Our main result is that the shape of the
final spectrum is mostly sensitive to uncertain parameters of the
magnetospheric plasma, but the MF geometry plays an important role on the
angle-dependence of the spectra.

of whether the gap in the spacing in the imaginary part of the QNM frequencies

the limit. The existence and the value of this limit has a crucial importance
from the point of view of the currently popular Maggiore's conjecture, which
represents a way of connecting the asymptotic behavior of the quasi-normal
frequencies to the black hole thermodynamics. With the help of previous results
and insights we will prove that the gap in the imaginary part of the
frequencies does not converge to any limit, unless one puts specific
constraints on the ratio of the two surface gravities related to the two
spacetime horizons. Specifically the constraints are that the ratio of the
surface gravities must be rational and such that it is given by two relatively
prime integers N, M, whose product is an even number. If the constraints are
fulfilled the limit of the sequence is still not guaranteed to exist, but if it
exists its value is given as the lowest common multiplier of the two surface
gravities. At the end of the paper we discuss the possible implications of our

later on, during the warm-up phase of the protostellar evolution. We aim to
study the formation of the grain mantles during the prestellar core phase and
the abundance of H2CO, CH3OH, and radicals trapped in them. We have developed a
macrosopic statistic multilayer model that follows the formation of grain
mantles with time and that includes two effects that may increase the number of
radicals trapped in the mantles: i) at each time of the mantle formation, only
the surface layer is chemically active rather than the entire bulk, and ii) the
porous structure of grains allows to trap reactive particles. The model
considers a network of H, O and CO forming neutral species such as water, CO,
formaldehyde, and methanol, plus several radicals. We run a large grid of
models to study the impact of the mantle multilayer nature and grain porous
structure. In addition, we explored the influence of the uncertainty of other
key parameters on the mantle composition. Our model predicts relatively large
abundances of radicals. In addition, the multilayer approach makes it possible
to follow the chemical differentiation within the grain mantle, showing that
the mantles are far from being uniform. For example, methanol is mostly present
in the outer layers of the mantles whereas CO and other reactive species are
trapped in the inner layers. The overall mantle composition depends on the
density and age of the prestellar core, and on some microscopic parameters.
Comparison with observations allows us to constrain the value of few parameters
and provide some indications on the physical conditions during the formation of
the ices.

as basis for an analysis methodology, the spatio-temporal entropy (STE)
measures the image (recurrence plots) ""structuredness"" in both space and time
domains. Initially we worked with the Huttunen et al. 2005's dataset and
studied the 41 MCs presenting a shock wave identified before the cloud. The STE
values for each Bx, By, Bz IMF time series, with dimension and time delay equal
to one, were respectively calculated. We found higher STE values in the sheaths
and zero STE values in some of the three components in most of the MCs (30
among 41 events). In a physically consistent manner, data windows of 2500
magnetic records were selected as the calculation interval for the time series.
As not all MCs have zero STE simultaneously, we created a standardization index
(an entropy index, called as EI) to allow joining the result of the three
components. With the use of EI three not known MCs were indeed identified and
then the MVA method allowed calculating their boundaries. Thus the EI is
proposed as an auxiliary tool to identify MC candidates based only on IMF
analysis. In a promissor condition, this methodology implemented gives basis

indeed even the Lorentz structure of the decay operator can be distinguished in
the case of three-body decays. These measurements can not only reveal the
correct model of new physics at the TeV scale, but also give information on
physics giving rise to the decay at energy scales far above those the LHC can
probe directly.

extremely low-loss experiments and compatibility with existing fiber networks.
We show that the uncertainty of the temperature measurement decreases with
longer integration periods, but is ultimately limited by the calibration
uncertainty. Temperature uncertainty on the order of 3 K is possible with
spatial resolution of the order of 1 cm and integration period as small as 60
seconds. Also, we show that the measurement is subject to systematic
uncertainties, such as polarization fading, which can be reduced with a
polarization diversity receiver.

estimated. This estimation has a detrimental effect on the performance of

probability or the average run length. We suggest an adjustment of the
monitoring schemes to overcome these problems. It guarantees, with a certain
probability, a conditional performance given the estimated in-control state.
The suggested method is based on bootstrapping the data used to estimate the
in-control state. The method applies to different types of control charts, and
also works with charts based on regression models, survival models, etc. If a
nonparametric bootstrap is used, the method is robust to model errors. We show
large sample properties of the adjustment. The usefulness of our approach is
demonstrated through simulation studies.

Lorentz symmetry violation in the photon sector: CPT-odd Maxwell-Chern-Simons
theory and CPT-even modified Maxwell theory. In this article, we focus on the
parity-odd nonbirefringent sector of modified Maxwell theory. It is coupled to
a standard Dirac theory of massive spin-1/2 fermions resulting in a modified
quantum electrodynamics (QED). This theory is discussed with respect to
properties such as microcausality and unitarity, where it turns out that these
hold. Furthermore, a priori, the limit of the theory for vanishing
Lorentz-violating parameters seems to be discontinuous. Since it is not clear,
whether this is a gauge artifact, the cross section for a physical process -
modified Compton scattering - is calculated numerically. Despite the numerical
instabilities occurring for scattering of unpolarized electrons off polarized
photons in the second physical polarization state, it is shown that for
Lorentz-violating parameters much smaller than 1 the modified theory approaches
standard QED, which is strengthened by analytical investigations. Hence, the
theory proves to be consistent, at least with regard to the investigations
performed. This leads to the interesting result of having a well-defined
parity-odd extension of QED.

transition to hydrodynamic expansion in an unified framework. The full set of
equations include local energy, momentum and charge conservation; but also
additional equations for evolution of non-equilibrium variables. These
equations with precisely determined phenomenological parameters can be obtained

contributing to the event selection for the 2011 running. The b-jets acceptance

Some of the greatest physicists of that time wondered whether a
quasi-two-dimensional (2D) superconductor can actually exist, what are the
peculiarities of 2D superconductivity, and how does the reduced dimensionality
affect the critical temperature (Tc). The discovery of high-temperature
superconductors, which are composed of coupled 2D superconducting layers,
further increased the interest in reduced dimensionality structures. In
parallel, the advances in experimental techniques made it possible to grow
epitaxial 2D structures with atomically flat surfaces and interfaces, enabling
some of the experiments that were proposed decades ago to be performed finally.
Now we know that interface superconductivity can occur at the junction of two
different materials (metals, insulators, semiconductors). This phenomenon is
being explored intensely; it is also exploited as a means to increase Tc or to
study quantum critical phenomena. This research may or may not produce a
superconductor with a higher Tc or a useful superconducting electronic device
but it will likely bring in new insights into the physics underlying
high-temperature superconductivity.

The largest radius increase of 0.2% was found in the case with the lowest mass
loss rate. For dynamical-timescale mass loss rates, that may be encountered
during a common envelope phase, the evolution is not adiabatic. The
superadiabatic outer layer of the giant's envelope has a local thermal
timescale comparable to the dynamical timescale. Therefore, this layer has
enough time to readjust thermally. Moreover, the giant star is driven out of
hydrostatic equilibrium and evolves dynamically. In these cases no increase of
the stellar radius with respect to its initial value is found. If the mass loss
rate is high enough, the superadiabaticity of the outer layer is lost
progressively and a radiative zone forms due to a combination of thermal and
dynamical readjustment. Conditions for unstable mass transfer based on
adiabatic mass loss models that predict a significant radius increase, may need
to be re-evaluated.

first inverse femtobarn of observations by CMS and ATLAS, where seductive
excesses in multijet events, particularly those with nine or more jets, are
unambiguously accounted for by a precision Monte-Carlo simulation of the

analysis by extrapolating for the expected data profile to be realized with

a recent model, in which cosmic-rays (CRs) prevail in the cores and stably heat
them through CR streaming. The non-thermal emissions come from the interaction
between CR protons and intracluster medium (ICM). Comparison between the
theoretical predictions and radio observations shows that the overall CR
spectra must be steep, and most of the CRs in the cores are low-energy CRs.
Assuming that the CRs are injected through AGN activities, we study the nature
of the shocks that are responsible for the CR acceleration. The steep CR
spectra are likely to reflect the fact that the shocks travel in hot ICM with
fairly small Much numbers. We also study the dependence on the CR streaming
velocity. The results indicate that synchrotron emissions from secondary
electrons should be observed as radio mini-halos in the cores. In particular,
low-frequency observations (e.g. LOFAR) are promising. On the other hand, the
steepness of the spectra makes it difficult to detect non-thermal X-ray and

probe the scales at which turbulent fragmentation occurs in dust continuum
emission, potentially constraining early stellar multiplicity. In this Letter
we present synthetic observations of starless and protostellar cores undergoing
fragmentation on scales of a few thousand AU to produce wide binary systems. We
show that interferometric observations of starless cores by CARMA should be
predominantly featureless at early stages, although wide protostellar
companions should be apparent. The enhanced capabilities of ALMA improve the
detection of core morphology so that it may be possible to detect substructure
at earlier times. In either case, spatial filtering from interferometry reduces
the observed core substructure and often eradicates traces of existing
filamentary morphology on scales down to 0.025 pc. However, some missing

on the assumption that haloes form out of local density maxima of a specific
height. Our comparison validates the predicted functional form for the
scale-dependence of the bias for both the density and velocity fields. We also
show that the bias coefficients are accurately predicted for the velocity
divergence. On the contrary, the theoretical values for the density bias
parameters do not accurately match the numerical results as a function of halo
mass. This is likely due to the simplistic assumptions that relate virialized
haloes to density peaks of a given height in the model. We also detect

been fitted using the halo model with only 2 free parameters, the minimum halo
mass and the power-law index of the mean occupation function of satellite
galaxies. The best-fit {\it minimum} halo mass is $\log(M_{\rm min}/M_\odot) =
12.24 \pm 0.06$, higher than, but consistent within the errors, with the
estimate by Amblard et al. (2011) and close to the estimate by Planck

galaxies yielded by the model is found to be consistent with that inferred from
the data. The derived {\it effective} halo mass, $M_{\rm eff} \simeq 5\times

estimated for the most efficient star-formers at the same redshift. The
effective bias factor and the comoving clustering radius at $z\simeq 2$ yielded
by the model are substantially lower than those found for a model whereby the
star formation is fueled by steady gas accretion, but substantially higher than
those found for a merging-driven galaxy evolution with a top-heavy initial mass
function.

but uncertainties in the stellar population and the dark matter profile make it
challenging to distinguish between the two components. Nevertheless, precise
observations of stellar and dark matter are extremely valuable for testing the
many models of structure formation and evolution. We present a measurement of
the stellar mass and inner slope of the dark matter halo of a massive
early-type galaxy at $z=0.222$. The galaxy is the foreground deflector of the
double Einstein ring gravitational lens system SDSSJ0946+1006, also known as
the ""Jackpot"". By combining the tools of lensing and dynamics, we first
constrain the mean slope of the total mass density profile
($\rho_{\rm{tot}}\propto r^{-\gamma'}$) within the radius of the outer ring to
be $\gamma' = 1.98\pm0.02\pm0.01$. Then we obtain a bulge-halo decomposition,
assuming a power-law form for the dark matter halo. Our analysis yields
$\gamma_{\rm{DM}} = 1.7\pm0.2$ for the inner slope of the dark matter profile,
in agreement with theoretical findings on the distribution of dark matter in
ellipticals, and a stellar mass from lensing and dynamics $M_*^{\rm{LD}} =
5.5_{-1.3}^{+0.4}\times10^{11}M_\Sun$. By comparing this measurement with
stellar masses inferred from stellar population synthesis fitting we find that
a Salpeter IMF provides a good description of the stellar population of the

We find that OH and CN, usually used in Zeeman observations of the
line-of-sight magnetic field, have an abundance that decreases toward the
center of the core much faster than the density increases. As a result, Zeeman
observations tend to sample the outer layers of the core and consistently
underestimate the core magnetic field. The degree of ionization follows a
complicated dependence on the number density at central densities up to 10^5
cm^{-3} for magnetic models and 10^6 cm^{-3} in non-magnetic models. At higher
central densities the scaling approaches a power-law with a slope of -0.6 and a
normalization which depends on the cosmic-ray ionization rate {\zeta} and the
temperature T as ({\zeta}T)^1/2. The mean molecular weight of ions is
systematically lower than the usually assumed value of 20 - 30, and, at high
densities, approaches a value of 3 due to the asymptotic dominance of the H3+

layers, and thus their inferred observational properties, rely on the
assumption that angular momentum transport is opposite to the radial angular
frequency gradient of the disk. The standard model for turbulent shear
viscosity satisfies this assumption by construction. However, this behavior is
not supported by numerical simulations of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
accretion disks, which show that angular momentum transport driven by the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) is inefficient in disk regions where, as
expected in boundary layers, the angular frequency increases with radius. In
order to shed light into physically viable mechanisms for angular momentum
transport in this inner disk region, we examine the generation of hydromagnetic
stresses and energy density in differentially rotating backgrounds with angular
frequencies that increase outward in the shearing-sheet framework. We isolate
the modes that are unrelated to the standard MRI and provide analytic solutions
for the long-term evolution of the resulting shearing MHD waves. We show that,
although the energy density of these waves can be amplified significantly,
their associated stresses oscillate around zero, rendering them an inefficient
mechanism to transport significant angular momentum (inward). These findings
are consistent with the results obtained in numerical simulations of MHD
accretion disk boundary layers and challenge the standard assumption of
efficient angular momentum transport in the inner disk regions. This suggests
that the detailed structure of turbulent MHD accretion disk boundary layers
could differ appreciably from those derived within the standard framework of
turbulent shear viscosity.

Hecke operators, and this leads to an action of the affine Hecke algebra on
functions on the maximal torus of the L-group. This action was previously
described by Lusztig using equivariant K-theory of the flag variety, leading to
the proof of the Deligne-Langlands conjecture by Kazhdan and Lusztig. In the

down to M(HI)~10^7 M_sun. We detect HI in ~40% of all ETGs outside the Virgo
cluster and in ~10% of all ETGs inside it. This demonstrates that it is common
for non-cluster ETGs to host HI. The HI morphology varies from regular
discs/rings (the majority of the detections) to unsettled gas distributions.
The former are either small discs (M(HI)<10^8 M_sun) confined within the
stellar body and sharing the same kinematics of the stars, or large discs/rings
(M(HI) up to 5x10^9 M_sun) extending to tens of kpc from the host galaxy and
frequently kinematically decoupled from the stars. Neutral hydrogen provides
material for star formation in ETGs. Galaxies with central HI exhibit
signatures of star formation in ~70% of the cases, ~5 times more frequently
than galaxies without central HI. The central ISM is dominated by molecular
gas. In ETGs with a small gas disc the conversion of HI into H_2 is as
efficient as in spirals. The ETG HI mass function has M*~2x10^9 M_sun and
slope=-0.7. ETGs host much less HI than spirals as a family. However, a
significant fraction of them is as HI-rich as spirals. The main difference
between ETGs and spirals is that the former lack the high-column-density HI
typical of the bright stellar disc of the latter. We find an envelope of
decreasing M(HI) with increasing environment density. The gas-richest ETGs live
in the poorest environments (where star-formation is more common), galaxies in
the centre of Virgo have the lowest HI content, and the cluster outskirts are a
transition region. We find an HI morphology-density relation. At low
environment density HI is mostly distributed on large discs/rings. More
disturbed HI morphologies dominate environment densities typical of rich
groups, confirming the importance of processes occurring on a galaxy-group
scale for the evolution of ETGs.

evaluating the cut capacity over exponentially many cuts. We show that the
minimum cut capacity of a relay network under some special assumptions can be

show that they can be solved in polynomial time. In particular, we show that
the minimization of the sum of powers assigned to the nodes subject to a

that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters
that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by
first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to
high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods
such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is
highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\epsilon} and a
desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm
exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the
algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an
extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses
a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a
wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to
double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as
efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC
method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also
derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\epsilon} on the fly
based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at
all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic
inference engines that require efficient ""turnkey"" sampling algorithms.

their relative position with respect to each other, nor their orientation with
respect to the solar equator. Assuming a symmetric acceleration process, it is
also clear that differences in footpoint spectral indices and footpoint flux
ratios can seldom be attributed to a difference in column densities between the
two legs of a coronal loop. Our results corroborate better the magnetic mirror
trap scenario. Moreover, footpoint asymmetries are more marked during times of
peak HXR flux than when averaging over the whole HXR burst, suggesting that the
magnetic configuration evolves during individual HXR bursts. We observed also a
linear correlation between the peak 50-keV flux and the peak GOES 1-8A channel

temperature peaked around 10-11 MK, and its emission measure increased

plasma has been observed by UVCS on SoHO for 2.3 days. This hot plasma was
interpreted as the signature of a current sheet trailing the CME (Bemporad et
al. 2006). The thermal energy content of the X-ray source is more than an order
of magnitude larger than in the current sheet. Hence, it could be the source of
the hot plasma in the current sheet, although current sheet heating by magnetic
reconnection within it cannot be discounted. To better characterize the X-ray
spectrum, we have used novel techniques (back-projection based and
visibility-based) for long integration (several hours) imaging spectroscopy.

the conclusion that there is either very little particle acceleration occurring

observables in dynamical lattice QCD employing non-local operators with
staple-shaped, ""process-dependent"" Wilson lines. The use of staple-shaped
Wilson lines allows us to link lattice simulations to TMD effects determined
from experiment, and in particular to access non-universal, naively
time-reversal odd TMD observables. We present and discuss results for the
generalized Sivers and Boer-Mulders transverse momentum shifts for the SIDIS
and DY cases. The effect of staple-shaped Wilson lines on T-even observables is
studied for the generalized tensor charge and a generalized transverse shift
related to the worm gear function g_1T. We emphasize the dependence of these
observables on the staple extent and the Collins-Soper evolution parameter. Our
numerical calculations use an n_f = 2+1 mixed action scheme with domain wall
valence fermions on an Asqtad sea and pion masses 369 MeV as well as 518 MeV.

potential suitable for inflation. Our construction is based upon a solution
known in string theory as the linear dilaton, in which the back-reaction from a
bulk scalar \Phi is exactly accounted for. The radion, stabilized by \Phi, is
much heavier than the TeV scale and its couplings to the standard model are
much more suppressed than in the usual Randall-Sundrum solution. We present a
new formalism for obtaining approximate time-dependent solutions, based on
perturbing the exact solution to the coupled Einstein and scalar field
equations in the bulk. It allows the radion potential to be computed directly
in terms of the brane potentials for \Phi. We show that simple exponential
potentials on the branes can lead to a 4D radion potential with a flattened
hilltop form, yielding inflation with a spectral index of typically n_s=0.96
and no higher than 0.99. With more complicated brane potentials, the descent
from the hilltop can be a linear potential, giving a tensor-to-scalar ratio as
large as r=0.07 with n_s=0.974. The couplings of the radion to the standard
model particles are dictated by general covariance, so the details of reheating
are explicitly calculable, leading to a reheat temperature of at least 10^7
GeV. The quantum corrections to the inflaton potential from its couplings to
matter are also calculable and are shown to be small, so that the prediction
for the shape of the potential is under theoretical control, even with

Galactic latitude Fermi-LAT sources, we have discovered the middle-aged pulsar
J2030+3641, associated with 1FGL J2030.0+3641 (2FGL J2030.0+3640). Following
the detection of gamma-ray pulsations using a radio ephemeris, we have obtained
a phase-coherent timing solution based on gamma-ray and radio pulse arrival
times that spans the entire Fermi mission. With a rotation period of 0.2 s,
spin-down luminosity of 3e34 erg/s, and characteristic age of 0.5 Myr, PSR
J2030+3641 is a middle-aged neutron star with spin parameters similar to those
of the exceedingly gamma-ray-bright and radio-undetected Geminga. Its gamma-ray
flux is 1% that of Geminga, primarily because of its much larger distance, as
suggested by the large integrated column density of free electrons, DM=246
pc/cc. We fit the gamma-ray light curve, along with limited radio polarimetric
constraints, to four geometrical models of magnetospheric emission, and while
none of the fits have high significance some are encouraging and suggest that
further refinements of these models may be worthwhile. We argue that not many
more non-millisecond radio pulsars may be detected along the Galactic plane
that are responsible for LAT sources, but that modified methods to search for
gamma-ray pulsations should be productive -- PSR J2030+3641 would have been
found blindly in gamma rays if only >0.8 GeV photons had been considered, owing
to its relatively flat spectrum and location in a region of high soft
background.

important problems in the design of processors today. This is especially true
in power-constrained environments, such as embedded and mobile computing. While
lowering the operational voltage can reduce power consumption, there are limits
imposed at design time, beyond which hardware components experience faulty
operation. Moreover, the decrease in feature size has led to higher
susceptibility to process variations, leading to reliability issues and
lowering yield. However, not all computations and all data in a workload need
to maintain 100% fidelity. In this paper, we explore the idea of employing
functional or storage units that let go the conservative guardbands imposed on
the design to guarantee reliable execution. Rather, these units exhibit Elastic
Fidelity, by judiciously lowering the voltage to trade-off reliable execution
for power consumption based on the error guarantees required by the executing
code. By estimating the accuracy required by each computational segment of a
workload, and steering each computation to different functional and storage
units, Elastic Fidelity Computing obtains power and energy savings while
reaching the reliability targets required by each computational segment. Our
preliminary results indicate that even with conservative estimates, Elastic
Fidelity can reduce the power and energy consumption of a processor by 11-13%
when executing applications involving human perception that are typically
included in modern mobile platforms, such as audio, image, and video decoding.

spatially modulated Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In this study, the
superconductivity in multilayer models exhibiting inhomogeneous Rashba
spin-orbit coupling is investigated. We study the electronic structure,
superconducting gap, and spin susceptibility in the superconducting state with
mixed parity order parameters. We show the enhancement of the spin
susceptibility by Rashba spin-orbit coupling and interpret it on the basis of
the crossover from a centrosymmetric superconductor to a non-centrosymmetric
superconductor. It is also shown that the spin susceptibility is determined by
the phase difference of the order parameter between layers and is nearly
independent of the parity mixing of order parameters. An intuitive
understanding is given on the basis of the analytic expression of
superconducting order parameters in the band basis. The results indicate that
not only a broken global inversion symmetry but also a broken local inversion
symmetry leads to unique properties of superconductivity. We discuss the
superconductivity in artificial superlattices involving CeCoIn5 and multilayer
high-Tc cuprates.

Unlike in previous lattice-based homomorphic encryption schemes, where the

message in the affine part of the transformation and applies noise only to
achieve security. Our scheme can tolerate noise of arbitrary magnitude, as long
as the noise vector has sufficiently small hamming weight (and its entries are

  Our design achieves ""proto-homomorphic"" properties in an elementary manner:
message addition and multiplication are emulated by pointwise addition and
multiplication of the ciphertext vectors. Moreover, the extremely simple nature
of our decryption makes the scheme easily amenable to bootstrapping. However,
some complications are caused by the inherent presence of noticeable encryption
error. Our main technical contribution is the development of two new techniques

crystallographic quality is often very high (free growth). 2) From melt fluxes
such as alkaline hydroxides or other oxides (MoO3, V2O5, P2O5, PbO) and salts
(PbCl2, PbF2). Melt fluxes offer the possibility to grow bulk ZnO under mild
conditions (<1000 deg. C, atmospheric pressure), but the crystals always
contain traces of solvent. The limited purity is a severe drawback, especially
for electronic applications. 3) From hydrothermal fluxes, usually alkaline
(KOH, LiOH) aqueous solutions beyond the critical point. Due to the amphoteric
character of ZnO, the supercritical bases can dissolve it up to several per
cent of mass. The technical requirements for this growth technology are
generally hard, but this did not hinder its development as the basic technique
for the growth of {\alpha}-quartz, and meanwhile also of zinc oxide, during the
last decades. 4) From pure melts, which is the preferred technology for
numerous substances applied whenever possible, e.g. for the growth of silicon,
gallium arsenide, sapphire, YAG. The benefits of melt growth are (i) the high
growth rate and (ii) the absence of solvent related impurities. In the case of
ZnO, however, it is difficult to find container materials that are compatible
from the thermal (fusion point Tf = 1975 deg. C) and chemical (required oxygen
partial pressure) point of view. Either cold crucible (skull melting) or

Yang-Mills theories. We study the impact of these transitions in QCD-like
theories for which centre symmetry is explicitly broken by the presence of
matter. For low temperatures, we provide numerical evidence that centre
transitions do occur with matter merely providing a bias towards the trivial
centre sector until centre symmetry is spontaneously broken at high
temperatures. The phenomenological consequences of these transitions for dense
hadron matter are illustrated in an SU(3) effective quark theory: centre
dressed quarks undergo condensation due to Bose-type statistics forming a
hitherto unknown state of dense but cold quark matter.

is close enough that individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) can be
identified. The goal of this work is to study the properties of the GMCs in
this subsolar metallicity galaxy. The CPROPS (Cloud Properties) algorithm
(Rosolowsky & Leroy 2006) was used to identify 337 GMCs in M 33, the largest
sample to date in an external galaxy. The sample is used to study the GMC
luminosity function, or mass spectrum under the assumption of a constant
N(H2)/ICO ratio. We find that n(L)dL = K*L^(-2.0\pm0.1) for the entire sample.
However, when the sample is divided into inner and outer disk samples, the
exponent changes from 1.6 \pm 0.2 for the centre 2 kpc to 2.3 \pm 0.2 for
galactocentric distances larger than 2 kpc. Based on the emission in the FUV,
Halpha, 8mu, and 24mu bands, each cloud was classified in terms of its star
forming activity - no star formation, embedded, or exposed star formation
(visible in FUV and Halpha). At least one sixth of the clouds had no (massive)
star formation, suggesting that the average time required for star formation to
start is about one sixth of the total time for which the object is identifiable
as a GMC. The clouds without star formation have significantly lower CO
luminosities than those with star formation, whether embedded or exposed,
presumably related to the lack of heating sources. Taking the cloud sample as a
whole, the main non-trivial correlation was the decrease in cloud CO brightness
(or luminosity) with galactocentric radius. The complete cloud catalog,
including CO and HI spectra and the CO contours on the FUV, Halpha, 8mu, and
24mu images is presented in the appendix.

sensor nodes form non-overlapping distributed clusters due to high data
correlation among them. We develop a probabilistic model for each distributed

galaxies at 0.4<z<1.4, covering a temperature range of 1.5<=kT<=11 keV. We
performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis to study how the abundance
evolves with redshift not only through a single emission measure performed on
the whole cluster but also spatially resolving the cluster emission. We do not
observe a statistically significant (>2sigma) abundance evolution with
redshift. The most significant deviation from no evolution (90% c.l.) is
observed in the emission from the whole cluster (r<0.6r500), that could be
parametrized as Z=A*(1+z)^(-0.8+/-0.5). Dividing the emission in 3 radial bins,
no significant evidence of abundance evolution could be observed fitting the
data with a power-law. A substantial agreement with measures presented in
previous works is found. The error-weighted mean of the spatially resolved
abundances in 3 redshift bins is consistent to be constant with z. Although the
large error bars in the measure of the weighted-mean abundance prevent us from
claiming any significant spatially resolved evolution, the trend with z in the
0.15-0.4r500 radial bin complements nicely the measures of Maughan et al., and
broadly agrees with theoretical predictions. We also found that the data points
derived from the spatially resolved analysis are well fitted by the relation
Z(r,z)=Z0*(1+(r/0.15r500)^2)^(-a)*((1+z)/1.6)^(-gamma), showing a significant
negative trend of Z with the radius and no significant evolution with the
redshift. The present study is the first attempt made to spatially resolve the
evolution of abundance with redshift. However, the sample size and the low
statistics associated with most of the clusters in the sample prevents us to
draw any statistically significant conclusion on the different evolutionary
path that the different regions of the clusters may have traversed.

material. For a correct analysis of observations we need to fully understand
the effects of dust particle parameters, as well as the effects of the
telescope, atmospheric seeing, and assumptions about the data reduction and
processing of the observed signal. Here we study the major effects of dust
particle structure, size-dependent grain settling, and instrumental properties.
We performed radiative transfer modeling using different dust particle models
and disk structures. To study the influence of seeing and telescope diffraction
we ran the models through an instrument simulator for the ExPo dual-beam
imaging polarimeter mounted at the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT).
Particle shape and size have a strong influence on the brightness and
detectability of the disks. In the simulated observations, the central
resolution element also contains contributions from the inner regions of the
protoplanetary disk besides the unpolarized central star. This causes the
central resolution element to be polarized, making simple corrections for
instrumental polarization difficult. This effect strongly depends on the
spatial resolution, so adaptive optics systems are needed for proper
polarization calibration. We find that the commonly employed homogeneous sphere
model gives results that differ significantly from more realistic models. For a
proper analysis of the wealth of data available now or in the near future, one
must properly take the effects of particle types and disk structure into
account. The observed signal depends strongly on the properties of these more
realistic models, thus providing a potentially powerful diagnostic. We conclude
that it is important to correctly understand telescope depolarization and
calibration effects for a correct interpretation of the degree of polarization.

state agency sells spectrum channels to Primary Operators (POs) who
subsequently resell them to Secondary Operators (SOs) through auctions. We show
that these hierarchical markets do not result in a socially efficient spectrum
allocation which is aimed by the agency, due to lack of coordination among the
entities in different layers and the inherently selfish revenue-maximizing
strategy of POs. In order to reconcile these opposing objectives, we propose an
incentive mechanism which aligns the strategy and the actions of the POs with
the objective of the agency, and thus leads to system performance improvement
in terms of social welfare. This pricing-based scheme constitutes a method for
hierarchical market regulation. A basic component of the proposed incentive
mechanism is a novel auction scheme which enables POs to allocate their
spectrum by balancing their derived revenue and the welfare of the SOs.

room-temperature ferromagnetism and huge efforts are made in order to grow

are quantum mechanically unstable because they produce a Hawking-like radiation
which is blue shifted at their front wall without any bound. We reexamine this
instability when local Lorentz invariance is violated at ultrahigh energy by
dispersion, as in some theories of quantum gravity. Interestingly, even though
the ultraviolet divergence is now regulated, warp drives are still unstable.
Moreover the type of instability is different whether one uses a subluminal or
a superluminal dispersion relation. In the first case, a black-hole laser
yields an exponential amplification of the emitted flux whereas, in the second,
infrared effects produce a linear growth of that flux. These results suggest
that chronology could still be protected when violating Lorentz invariance.

instability as a trigger of a CME which occurred in AR NOAA 11163 on 24
February 2011. The CME was associated with a M3.5 limb flare. High resolution
observations from SDO/AIA suggest the development of helical kink instability
in the erupting prominence, which implies a flux rope structure of the magnetic
field. A brightening starts below the apex of the prominence with its slow
rising motion (~100 km/s) during the activation phase. A bright structure,
indicative of a helix with ~3-4 turns, was transiently formed at this position.
The corresponding twist of ~$6\pi-8\pi$ is sufficient to generate the helical
kink instability in a flux rope according to recently developed models. A
slowly rising blob structure was subsequently formed at the apex of the
prominence, and a flaring loop was observed near the footpoints. Within two
minutes, a second blob was formed in the northern prominence leg. The second
blob erupts (like a plasmoid ejection) with the detachment of the northern
prominence leg, and flare intensity maximizes. The first blob at the prominence
apex shows rotational motion in the counterclockwise direction in the plane of
sky, interpreted as unwinding motion of a helix, and it also erupts to give the
coronal mass ejection (CME). RHESSI hard X-ray sources show the two footpoint
sources and a loop-top source during the flare. We found RHESSI hard X-ray
flux, soft X-ray flux derivative and CME acceleration in the low corona
correlate well, which is in agreement with the standard flare model (CSHKP). We
also discuss the possible role of ballooning as well as torus instabilities in
driving the CME. We conclude that the CME and flare were triggered by the
helical kink instability in a flux rope and accelerated mainly by the torus
instability.

problem has a direct reduction to a nonabelian hidden subgroup problem (HSP),
suggesting a possible quantum algorithm analogous to Shor's algorithms for
factoring or discrete log. However, we recently showed that in many cases of
interest---including Goppa codes---solving this case of the HSP requires rich,
entangled measurements. Thus, solving these cases of Code Equivalence via
Fourier sampling appears to be out of reach of current families of quantum

  Code equivalence is directly related to the security of McEliece-type
cryptosystems in the case where the private code is known to the adversary.
However, for many codes the support splitting algorithm of Sendrier provides a
classical attack in this case. We revisit the claims of our previous article in

been inferred from impacts on the two STEREO spacecraft through observation of
secondary particle trails and unexpected off-points in the Heliospheric Imager
(HI) cameras. This study made use of analysis carried out by members of a
distributed web-based project, Solar Stormwatch. A comparison between
observations of the brightest particle trails and a survey of fainter trails
shows consistent distributions. While there is no obvious correlation between
this distribution and the occurrence of individual meteor streams at Earth,
there are some broad longitudinal features in these distributions that are also
observed in sources of the sporadic meteor population. The asymmetry in the
number of trails seen by each spacecraft and the fact that there are many more
unexpected off-points in the HI-B than in HI-A, indicates that the majority of
impacts are coming from the apex direction. For impacts causing off-points in
the HI-B camera these dust particles are estimated to have masses in excess of
10-17 kg with radii exceeding 0.1 {\mu}m. For off-points observed in the HI-A
images, which can only have been caused by particles travelling from the
anti-apex direction, the distribution is consistent with that of secondary
'storm' trails observed by HI-B, providing evidence that these trails also
result from impacts with primary particles from an anti-apex source. It is
apparent that the differential mass index of particles from the apex direction
is consistently above 2. This indicates that the majority of the mass is within
the smaller particles of this population. In contrast, the differential mass
index of particles from the anti-apex direction (causing off-points in HI-A) is
consistently below 2, indicating that the majority of the mass is to be found
in larger particles of this distribution.

Using this model we calculate that the incorporation of dilute concentrations
of Bi in GaP introduces Bi-related defect states in the band gap, which
interact with the host matrix valence band edge via a Bi composition dependent
band anti-crossing (BAC) interaction. By extending this analysis to GaBiAs we
demonstrate that the observed strong variation of the band gap Eg and
spin-orbit-splitting (SO) energy with Bi composition can be well explained in
terms of a BAC interaction between the extended states of the GaAs valence band
edge and highly localized Bi-related defect states lying in the valence band,
with the change in Eg also having a significant contribution from a
conventional alloy reduction in the conduction band edge energy. Our calculated
values of Eg and SO are in good agreement with experiment throughout the
investigated composition range x less than 13%. In particular, our calculations
reproduce the experimentally observed crossover to an Eg < SO regime at
approximately 10.5% Bi composition in bulk GaBiAs. Recent x-ray spectroscopy
measurements have indicated the presence of Bi pairs and clusters even for Bi
compositions as low as 2%. We include a systematic study of different Bi
nearest-neighbor environments in the alloy to achieve a quantitative
understanding of the effect of Bi pairing and clustering on the GaBiAs

field becomes an electromagnetic superconductor due to interplay between strong

associated with a spontaneous emergence of quark-antiquark condensates which
carry quantum numbers of charged rho mesons. The rho-meson condensate is an
inhomogeneous structure made of the so-called rho vortices, which are parallel
to the magnetic field axis. The condensation of the charged rho mesons induces
a (much weaker) superfluid-like condensate with quantum numbers of the neutral
rho mesons. In this paper we show that the vortices in the superconducting
condensate organize themselves in an equilateral triangular lattice similarly
to an ordinary type-II superconductor. We show that each of these
superconductor vortices is accompanied by three superfluid vortices and three
superfluid antivortices made of the neutral rho meson condensate. The
superconductor vortex overlaps with one of the superfluid vortices. The

ultradeep Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS). Dust extinction is estimated from the
rest-frame UV continuum slope and used to obtain dust-corrected star-formation
rates for the galaxies of the sample. For the entire sample, a mean value of
the continuum slope <\beta> = -1.11 \pm 0.44 (r.m.s.) was derived, while the
average SFR was found to be <SFR> = 52 \pm 48 M_sun/yr (r.m.s.). A positive
correlation between SFR and stellar mass was observed, in agreement with other
works, the logarithmic slope of the relation being 1.10 \pm 0.10.
Low-ionization absorption lines, associated with the interstellar medium, were
found to be blueshifted, with respect to the rest frame of the system, which
indicates that there is outflowing gas with typical velocities of the order of
~ 100 km/s. Finally, investigating correlations between galaxy UV spectral
characteristics and galaxy general properties, we report a possible correlation
between the equivalent width of the interstellar absorption lines and SFR,
stellar mass, and colour excess similar to that seen to hold at different
redshifts.

([WR]PNe) constitute a particular photoionized nebula class that represents
about 10% of the PNe with classified central stars. We analyse deep
high-resolution spectrophotometric data of 12 [WR]PNe. This sample represents
the most extensive analysed so far, at such high spectral resolution. We aim to
select the optimal physical conditions in the PNe to be used in ionic abundance
calculations that will be presented in a forthcoming paper. We acquired spectra
at LCO with the 6.5-m telescope and the MIKE spectrograph, covering a
wavelength range from 3350 to 9400 A. The spectra were exposed deep enough to
detect, with signal-to-noise ratio higher than three, the weak ORLs of OII,
CII, and other species. We detect and identify about 2980 emission lines,
which, to date, is the most complete set of spectrophotometric data published
for this type of objects. From our deep data, numerous diagnostic line ratios
for Te and Ne are determined from CELs, ORLs, and continuum measurements.
Densities are closely described by the average of all determined values for
objects with ne<10^4 cm-3, and by ne([Cl III]) for the densest objects. For Te,
we adopt a three-zone ionization scheme, where the low ionization zone is
characterized by Te([NII]), the medium ionization zone by Te([OIII]) and the
highest ionization one by Te([ArIV]) when available. We compute Te from the HI
Paschen discontinuity and from HeI lines. We do not find evidences of the
presence of low-temperature, high-density clumps in our [WR]PNe from the
analysis of faint O II and N II plasma diagnostics. The behaviour of
Te([OIII])/Te([NII]) being very low for high ionization degrees can be
reproduced by a set of combined matter-bounded and radiation-bounded models,
however, for the lowest temperature ratios, too high metallicity seem required.

  mechanics","20 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An out of the box intellectual path exploring the foundations of quantum
mechanics is discussed in some detail, in order to clarify why a possibly
different way to look at the relevant fundamental questions can be identified
and can support further research. Two key concepts arise. (1) Einstein critics
to quantum mechanics could be taken seriously, but ironically, in order to
really do so, one would have to take seriously also some of Lorentz critics to
special relativity - both in a possibly more modern way; such interconnection
possibly having been a blocking factor to openly discuss some of the cross
implications of alternative views about quantum mechanics to date. (2) The
probabilistic interpretation is a by-product of (a) quantum evolution
equations, (b) conservation laws for the combination of measuring system and
measured object and (c) persistency of calibration of the measuring system - as
such there is no intellectual conflict whatsoever between hidden variables
theories and probabilistic interpretation, provided we consider multicomponent
hidden variable models and we allow for the existence of an underlying network.
The implications of such concepts, in particular for the development of a
microscopic quantisation program, are heuristically discussed or preliminarily
explored.

with time. Any natural process drives a system to a state of greater
organization. Organization is a progressive change, while evolution is
expressed in the effects of accumulating marks acquired from contingent
encounters. Co-existence of the system in states of maximum organization as
well as maximum action forms the core idea of the paper. Major influences have
been drawn from the Principle of Least Action. This allows us to see how this
most basic law of physics determines the development of the system towards
states with less action i.e. organized states. Based on this, it has been
proposed, that the development of a system towards states of greater
organization is cyclic in nature and thus evolution is a cyclic process.
