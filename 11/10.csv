two-dimensional (2D) wireless networks. Local capacity is defined as the
average information rate received by a node randomly located in the network.
Using analysis based on analytical and numerical methods, we show that maximum
local capacity can be obtained if simultaneous emitters are positioned in a
grid pattern based on equilateral triangles. We also compare this maximum local
capacity with the local capacity of slotted ALOHA scheme and our results show
that slotted ALOHA can achieve at least half of the maximum local capacity in

occurs to be often biased in a very subtle way: usually refers to only
approximate fulfillment of thermodynamical principles like maximizing
uncertainty. Recently, a new philosophy of stochastic modeling was introduced,
which by being mathematically similar to euclidean path integrals, finally
fulfills these principles exactly. Their local behavior is usually similar, but
may lead to completely different global properties. In contrast to Brownian
motion leading to nearly uniform stationary density, this recent approach turns
out in agreement with having strong localization properties thermodynamical
predictions of quantum mechanics, like thermalizing to dynamical equilibrium
state having probability density as the quantum ground state: squares of
coordinates of the lowest energy eigenvector of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian
for single particle in discrete case, or of the standard Schrodinger operator
while including potential and making infinitesimal limit. It also provides a
natural intuition of the amplitudes' squares relating to probabilities. The
present paper gathers, formalizes and extends these results. There are also
introduced and discussed some new generalizations, like considering multiple
particles with thermodynamical analogue of Pauli exclusion principle or time
dependent cases, which allowed to introduce thermodynamical analogues of
momentum operator, Ehrenfest equation and Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

formulated for non-interacting Majorana-Weyl spinors in higher dimensions,
particularly in D=1+9 and D=5+5, can lead to an interpretation of massive
Majorana and Dirac spinors in D=1+3. By adopting suitable representations of
the Dirac matrices in higher dimensions, we pursue the investigation of which
higher dimensional space-times and which mass-shell relation concerning
massless Dirac equations in higher dimensions may induce massive spinors in
D=1+3. The mixing of the chiral fermions in higher dimensions may induce a
mechanism such that four massive Majorana fermions may show up and, at an
appropriate limit an almost zero and a huge mass show up with corresponding
left-handed and right-handed eigenstates. This mechanism, in a peculiar way,
could reassess the See-Saw scheme associated to neutrino with Majorana-type
masses. Remarkably the masses of the particles are fixed by the dimension
decoupling/reduction scheme based on the mass Lorentz invariant term, where one
set of the decoupled dimensions are the ""target"" coordinates frame and the
other set of coordinates is the composing block of the mass term in lower
dimensions. This proposal should allow us to understand the generation of
hierarchies, such as the fourth generation, for the fermionic masses in D=1+3,
or in lower dimensions in general, starting from the constraints between the
energy and the momentum in D=n+n. For the initial D=5+5 Majorana-Weyl spinors
framework using the Weyl representation to the Dirac matrices we observe an
intriguing decomposition of space-time that result in two very equivalent D=1+4
massive spinors which mass term, in D=1+3 included, is originated from the
remained/decoupled component and that could induce a Brane-World mechanism.

concerns the direct coupling of classical and quantum mechanical degrees of

schemes and may be relevant for the foundations of quantum mechanics, in
particular, when it comes to experiments exploring the quantum-classical

Hall and Reginatto, but shares with it to fullfill all consistency requirements
discussed in the literature, while earlier attempts failed in this respect. Our
work is based on the representation of quantum mechanics in the framework of
classical analytical mechanics by A. Heslot, showing that notions of states in

transformations can be naturally extended to quantum mechanics. This is
suitably generalized for quantum-classical hybrids here.

determine such a strong correlation. Results show that, depending on the
graphene-substrate adhesion, number of graphene layers and substrate stiffness,
graphene exhibits two distinct types of morphology: I) graphene remains bonded
to the substrate and corrugates to an amplitude up to that of the substrate
surface patterns; II) graphene debonds from the substrate and remains flat on
top of the substrate surface patterns. The sharp transition between these two
types of graphene morphology occurs at a critical adhesion between the graphene

redshift z<0.1. By visual inspection of SDSS images we removed false
identifications and we classify the interactions into three categories: pairs
undergoing merging, M; pairs with evident tidal features, T; and non disturbed,
N. We also divide the pair sample into minor and major interactions according
to the luminosity ratio of the galaxy members. We study star formation activity

pairs) with member galaxies showing evidence of old stellar populations.
Regardless of the color distribution, we find a prominent blue peak in the
strongest mergers, while pairs with tidal signs under a minor merger show a
strong red peak. Therefore, our results show that galaxy interactions are
important in driving the evolution of galaxy bimodality. By adding stellar
masses and star formation rates of the two members of the pairs, we explore the
global efficiency of star formation of the pairs as a whole. We find that, at a

disturbed pairs show a preference to contain the brightest galaxy in the

pair galaxies and the control sample, consisting in color tails with a clear
excess of extremely blue and red galaxies for merging systems. In addition,
pair galaxies show a significant excess of young stellar populations with
respect to galaxies in the control sample; this finding suggests that, in dense

the generators of this order. It turns out that for D sufficiently large, there
are two Teichmueller curves when D=1 modulo 8, only one Teichmueller curve when
D=0,4 modulo 8, and no Teichmueller curves when D=5 modulo 8. For small values
of D, where this classification is not necessarily true, the number of
Teichmueller curves can be determined directly. The ingredients of our proof
are first, a description of these curves in terms of prototypes and models, and
then a careful analysis of the combinatorial connectedness in the spirit of
McMullen. As a consequence, we obtain a description of cusps of Teichmueller

supersymmetry-breaking (GMSB) models can produce unstable Q-balls which
naturally have field strength similar to the messenger scale. In this case a
new kind of Q-ball is formed, intermediate between gravity-mediated and
gauge-mediated type. We study in detail these new Q-ball solutions, showing how
their properties interpolate between standard gravity-mediated and
gauge-mediated Q-balls as the AD field becomes larger than the messenger scale.
It is shown that E/Q for the Q-balls can be greater than the nucleon mass but
less than the MSSM-LSP mass, leading to Q-ball decay directly to Standard Model
fermions with no MSSM-LSP production. More significantly, if E/Q is greater
than the MSSM-LSP mass, decaying Q-balls can provide a natural source of
non-thermal MSSM-LSPs, which can subsequently decay to gravitino dark matter
without violating nucleosynthesis constraints. The model therefore provides a
minimal scenario for baryogenesis and gravitino dark matter in the
gauge-mediated MSSM, requiring no new fields.

realistic solution to the dark matter problem of Cosmology for the dust epoch,
without a fine tunning because the contribution of the scalar field in this
theory is equivalent to a stiff fluid (as can be seen from the energy--momentum
tensor for the scalar field), that evolves in a different way as the dust
component. To have similar contributions of the scalar component and the dust
component implies that their past values were fine tunned. So, we
reinterpreting this null result as an indication that dark matter plays a
central role in the formation of structures and galaxy evolution, having
measureable effects in the cosmic microwave bound radiation, and than this
formalism yield to this epoch as primigenius results. We do the mention that
this formalism was used recently in the so called K-essence theory applied to
dark energy problem, in place to the dark matter problem. Also, we include a
quantization procedure of the theory which can be simplified by reinterpreting
the theory in the Einstein frame, where the scalar field can be interpreted as
part of the matter content of the theory, and exact solutions to the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation are found, employing the Bianchi Class A cosmological
models.

Technicolor. We simulate lattice QCD with 2 light color-sextet staggered quarks

transition on the temporal extent, $N_t$, of the lattice in lattice units to
study the running of the bare lattice coupling with lattice spacing. Our goal
is to determine whether this theory is QCD-like and `walks', or if it is
conformal. If it is QCD-like, the coupling at the chiral transition should tend
to zero as $N_t \rightarrow \infty$ in a manner controlled by asymptotic
freedom, i.e. by the perturbative $\beta$-function. On the other hand, if this
theory is conformal, this coupling will approach a non-zero limit in the $N_t

double-lined, detached eclipsing binary in a 4.674 d orbit, with equal-mass
components (M_2/M_1 = 0.985 \pm 0.029). Here we present extensive VIcJHKs light
curves spanning ~15 yr, as well as a Keck/HIRES optical spectrum. The light
curves evince a third light source that is variable with a period of 0.73 d,
and is also manifested in the high-resolution spectrum, strongly indicating the
presence of a third star in the system, probably a rapidly rotating classical T
Tauri star. We incorporate this third light into our radial velocity and light
curve modeling of the eclipsing pair, measuring accurate masses (M_1 = 0.391
\pm 0.032, M_2 = 0.385 \pm 0.032 M\odot), radii (R_1 = 1.73 \pm 0.02, R_2 =
1.62 \pm 0.02 R\odot), and temperature ratio (T_1/T_2 = 1.0924 \pm 0.0017).
Thus the radii of the eclipsing stars differ by 6.9 \pm 0.8%, the temperatures
differ by 9.2 \pm 0.2%, and consequently the luminosities differ by 62 \pm 3%,
despite having masses equal to within 3%. This could be indicative of an age
difference of ~3x10^5 yr between the two eclipsing stars, perhaps a vestige of
the binary formation history. We find that the eclipsing pair is in an orbit
that has not yet fully circularized, e = 0.0166 \pm 0.003. In addition, we
measure the rotation rate of the eclipsing stars to be 4.629 \pm 0.006 d; they
rotate slightly faster than their 4.674 d orbit. The non-zero eccentricity and
super-synchronous rotation suggest that the eclipsing pair should be tidally
interacting, so we calculate the tidal history of the system according to
different tidal evolution theories. We find that tidal heating effects can
explain the observed luminosity difference of the eclipsing pair, providing an
alternative to the previously suggested age difference.

photons, is currently disappearing from the universe at the rate of nearly
10^55 erg s^-1. An ongoing problem in cosmology concerns the fate of this
energy. In one interpretation it is irretrievably lost, i.e., energy is not
conserved on the cosmic scale. Here we consider a different possibility which
retains universal energy conservation. If gravitational energy is redshifted in
the same manner as photons, then it can be shown that the cosmic redshift
removes gravitational energy from space at about the same rate as photon
energy. Treating gravitational potential energy conventionally as negative
energy, it is proposed that the Hubble shift 'flips' positive energy (photons)
to negative energy (gravitons) and vice versa. The lost photon energy would
thus be directed towards gravitation, making gravitational energy wells more
negative. Conversely, within astrophysical bodies of sufficient size, the
flipping of gravitons to photons would give rise to a 'Hubble luminosity' of
magnitude -UH, where U is the internal gravitational potential energy of the
object and H the Hubble constant. Evidence of such an energy release is
presented in bodies ranging from planets, white dwarfs and neutron stars to
supermassive black holes and the visible universe.

the VLTP scenario outperforms all other proposed scenarios as an explanation of

clusters and groups of galaxies. Such flows are gauged by spiral features in
the thermal and chemical properties of the intracluster medium, by the
multi-phase properties of CCs, and by X-ray edges known as cold fronts. We
analytically show that observations of piecewise-spiral fronts impose strong
constraints on the CC, implying the presence of a cold, fast flow, which
propagates below a hot, slow inflow, separated by a slowly rotating, trailing,
quasi spiral, tangential discontinuity surface. This leads to the nearly
logarithmic spiral pattern, two-phase plasma, \rho \sim r^{-1} density (or T
\sim r^{0.4} temperature) radial profile, and ~100kpc size, characteristic of
CCs. By advecting heat and mixing the gas, such flows can eliminate the cooling
problem, provided that a feedback mechanism regulates the flow. In particular,
we present a quasi-steady-state model for an accretion-quenched, composite
flow, in which the fast phase is an outflow, regulated by active galactic
nucleus bubbles, reproducing the observed low star formation rates and
explaining some features of bubbles such as their R_b \propto r size. The
simplest two-component model reproduces several key properties of CCs, so we

January 2007 mini-outbursts, the 2010 outburst with 6 rebrightenings. Over

during the outburst and 1-month post-outburst stage, 0.059005^d orbital humps

12.6 min, P2 = 21.7 min, P3 = 14.1 min and P4 = 4.28 min. The 12.6-min
periodicity first appeared 7 months after the 2006 outburst and was the most
prominent one during the following \sim 900 days. It was identified as
non-radial pulsations of the white dwarf. The period of this pulsations varied
within a range of 36 s, and amplitude changed from 0.013m to 0.03m.
Simultaneously one could observe the 21.7-min and 14.3-min periodicities with a

Topological Entanglement Entropy (TEE) on partitioning the torus into two
cylinders. In this setting, general considerations dictate that the TEE
generally differs from that in trivial partitions and depends on the chosen
ground state. Central to our scheme is the identification of ground states with
minimum entanglement entropy, which reflect the quasi-particle excitations of
the topological phase. The transformation of these states allows for a
determination of the modular S and U matrices which encode quasi-particle
properties. We demonstrate our method by extracting the modular S matrix of an
SU(2) spin symmetric chiral spin liquid phase using a Monte Carlo scheme to
calculate TEE, and prove that the quasi-particles obey semionic statistics.
This method offers a route to a nearly complete determination of the
topological order in certain cases.

hydrogen composition. The model atmosphere (Teff = 3950pm150K, log

consistent with thermal emission from the bulk of the neutron star surface,

the case of distinguishable particles, we consider an unbalanced scenario where
the momenta of the pair are well-defined and maximally entangled in the rest

family of non-maximally entangled bipartite states. In both cases, we show that
neither the spin-spin ($ss$) nor the momentum-momentum ($mm$) entanglements
quantified by means of Wootters' concurrence are Lorentz invariant quantities:
the total amount of entanglement regarded as the sum of these entanglements is
not the same in different inertial moving frames. In particular, for any value
of the entangling parameters, both $ss$ and $mm$-entanglements are attenuated
by Lorentz transformations and their parametric rates of change with respect to
the entanglements observed in a rest frame have the same monotonic behavior.
However, for indistinguishable (distinguishable) particles, the change in
entanglement for the momenta is (is not) the same as the change in entanglement
for spins. As a consequence, in both cases, no entanglement compensation

sufficiently strong, it is well-known that it leads to microphase separation

tendency towards modulation remains manifest in a liquid phase that exhibits
transient structure of a characteristic size; that is, it is a microemulsion.
The characteristic size of the fluctuating domains is estimated to be on the
order of 100 nm, and experiments to verify this hypothesis are proposed.

significant asymmetric line profiles with prominent wings extending 300-400
km/s redward of the peak emission. With these six LAEs, we revise our previous
estimate of the number of faint LAEs in the Dressler et al. survey. Combining
these data with the density of bright LAEs in the Cosmic Origins Survey and
Subaru Deep Field provides the best constraints to date on the redshift 5.7 LAE
luminosity function (LF). Schechter function parameters, phi^* = 4.5 x 10^{-4}
Mpc^{-3}, L^* = 9.1 x 10^{42} erg s^{-1}, and alpha= -1.70, are estimated using
a maximum likelihood technique with a model for slit losses. To place this
result in the context of the UV-selected galaxy population, we investigate how
various parameterizations of the Lyman Alpha equivalent width distribution,
along with the measured UV-continuum LF, affect shape and normalization of the
Lyman Alpha LF. The nominal model, which uses z~6 equivalent widths from the
literature, falls short of the observed space density of LAEs at the bright
end, possibly indicating a need for higher equivalent widths. This
parameterization of the equivalent width distribution implies that as many as
50% of our faintest LAEs should have M_{UV} > -18.0, rendering them
undetectable in even the deepest Hubble Space Telescope surveys at this
redshift. Hence, ultra-deep emission-line surveys find some of the faintest
galaxies ever observed at the end of the reionization epoch. Such faint
galaxies likely enrich the intergalactic medium with metals and maintain its
ionized state. Observations of these objects provide a glimpse of the building
blocks of present-day galaxies at an early time.

presented. We study the ratios of strange $B$ meson to light $B$ meson
production $f_s/(f_u+f_d)$ and $\Lambda_b^0$ baryon to light $B$ meson
production $f_{\Lambda_b}/(f_u+f_d)$ as a function of the charmed hadron-muon
pair transverse momentum $p_T$ and the $b$ hadron pseudorapidity $\eta$, for
$p_T$ between 0 and 14 GeV and $\eta$ between 2 and 5. We find that
$f_s/(f_u+f_d)$ is consistent with being independent of $p_{\rm T}$ and $\eta$,
and we determine $f_s/(f_u+f_d)$ = 0.134$\pm$ 0.004 $^{+0.011}_{-0.010}$, where
the first error is statistical and the second systematic. The corresponding
ratio $f_{\Lambda_b}/(f_u+f_d)$ is found to be dependent upon the transverse
momentum of the charmed hadron-muon pair, $f_{\Lambda_b}/(f_u+f_d)=(0.404\pm
0.017 (stat) \pm 0.027 (syst) \pm 0.105 (Br))\times[1 -(0.031 \pm 0.004 (stat)
\pm 0.003 (syst))\times p_T(GeV)]$, where Br reflects an absolute scale
uncertainty due to the poorly known branching fraction Br(\Lambda_c^+ \to
pK^-\pi^+)$. We extract the ratio of strange $B$ meson to light neutral $B$
meson production $f_s/f_d$ by averaging the result reported here with two
previous measurements derived from the relative abundances of $\bar{B}_s \to
D_S^+ \pi ^-$ to $\bar{B}^0 \to D^+K^-$ and $\bar{B}^0 \to D^+\pi^-$. We obtain
$f_s/f_d=0.267^{+0.021}_{-0.020}$.

Dirac neutrino masses, connecting the tuning of the cosmological constant to
the puzzle of neutrino masses. Surprisingly, under the assumption of low-scale
supersymmetry breaking and superpartner masses close to a TeV, these masses are
independent of the fundamental supersymmetry-breaking scale, and accommodate
the correct magnitude. This offers a novel explanation for the vastly different
scales of neutrino and charged fermion masses. These models require that
R-symmetric supersymmetry exists at the TeV scale, and predict that neutrino
masses are purely Dirac, implying the absence of neutrino-less double
beta-decay. Interesting collider signals can arise due to charged scalars which
decay leptonically, with branching ratios determined by the neutrino mixing

radius of 1.28 +/- 0.08 Jupiter radii. Its mean density of 4.6 g/cm3 is one of
the highest known for planets with periods less than 3 days. We obtained three
secondary eclipse light curves with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The eclipse
depths from the best jointly fit model are $0.224\%$ +/- $0.018\%$ at 4.5

irradiated, WASP-14b does not show any distinct evidence of a thermal

the action of the gravitational instability -- the cosmic web -- is complicated

cold dark matter (CDM) N-body cosmological simulations. The method is based on
the fact that the initial CDM state can be described by a 3-D manifold (in a
6-D phase space) that remains continuous under evolution. Our technique uses
the full phase space information and has no free parameters; it can be used to
compute multi-stream and density fields, the main focus of this paper. Using a
large-box LCDM simulation we carry out a variety of initial analyses with the
technique. These include studying the correlation between multi-streaming and
density, the identification of structures such as Zel'dovich pancakes and
voids, and statistical measurements of quantities such as the volume fraction
as a function of the number of streams -- where we find a remarkable scaling
relation. Cosmological implications are briefly discussed.

into the Cosmic Microwave Background and imprints a new observable, which can
be used as a cosmological probe. We apply a four-point estimator to the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 7-year coadded temperature maps

simulated and subtracted, and the higher order bias is investigated. We measure
a gravitational lensing signal with a statistical amplitude of $\mathcal {C}$ =
$1.27\pm 0.98$ using all the correlations of the W- and V-band Differencing
Assemblies (DAs). We therefore conclude that WMAP 7-year data alone, can not

algebraic curves, endowed with $n$ unordered marked points.
  Looijenga introduced the notion of Prym level structures in order to
construct smooth projective Galois coverings of the stack $\ccM_{g}$.
  In \S 2 of this paper, we introduce the notion of Looijenga level structure
which generalizes Looijenga construction and provides a tower of Galois
coverings of $\ccM_{g,[n]}$ equivalent to the tower of all geometric level
structures over $\ccM_{g,[n]}$.
  In \S 3, Looijenga level structures are interpreted geometrically in terms of
moduli of curves with symmetry. A byproduct of this characterization is a
simple criterion for their smoothness. As a consequence of this criterion, it
is shown that Looijenga level structures are smooth under mild hypotheses.
  The second part of the paper, from \S 4, deals with the problem of describing
the D-M boundary of level structures. In \S 6, a description is given of the
nerve of the D-M boundary of abelian level structures. In \S 7, it is shown how
this construction can be used to ""approximate"" the nerve of Looijenga level
structures. These results are then applied to elaborate a new approach to the
congruence subgroup problem for the Teichm\""uller modular group.

this gives a characterization of simple closed curves on $S$ in terms of

between physical phenomena and homology and cohomology theories. Over the past
twenty-five years, a considerable effort has been invested by the computational
electromagnetics community to develop fast and general techniques for potential
design. When magneto-quasi-static discrete formulations based on magnetic
scalar potential are employed in problems which involve conductive regions with
holes, \textit{cuts} are needed to make the boundary value problem well
defined. While an intimate connection with homology theory has been quickly
recognized, heuristic definitions of cuts are surprisingly still dominant in
the literature.
  The aim of this paper is first to survey several definitions of cuts together
with their shortcomings. Then, cuts are defined as generators of the first
cohomology group over integers of a finite CW-complex. This provably general
definition has also the virtue of providing an automatic, general and efficient
algorithm for the computation of cuts. Some counter-examples show that
heuristic definitions of cuts should be abandoned. The use of cohomology theory
is not an option but the invaluable tool expressly needed to solve this
problem.

(IR) spectroscopy of the shell in the composite supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 75
(G29.7-0.3). The remnant is composed of a central pulsar wind nebula and a
bright partial shell in the south that is visible at radio, IR, and X-ray
wavelengths. The X-ray emission can be modeled by either a single thermal
component with a temperature of ~ 1.5 keV, or with two thermal components with
temperatures of 1.5 and 0.2 keV. Previous studies suggest that the hot
component may originate from reverse-shocked SN ejecta. However, our new
analysis shows no definitive evidence for enhanced abundances of Si, S, Ar, Mg,
and Fe, as expected from supernova (SN) ejecta, or for the IR spectral
signatures characteristic of confirmed SN condensed dust, thus favoring a
circumstellar or interstellar origin for the X-ray and IR emission. The X-ray
and IR emission in the shell are spatially correlated, suggesting that the dust
particles are collisionally heated by the X-ray emitting gas. The IR spectrum
of the shell is dominated by continuum emission from dust with little, or no
line emission. Modeling the IR spectrum shows that the dust is heated to a
temperature of ~ 140 K by a relatively dense, hot plasma, that also gives rise
to the hot X-ray emission component. The density inferred from the IR emission
is significantly higher than the density inferred from the X-ray models,
suggesting a low filling factor for this X-ray emitting gas. The total mass of
the warm dust component is at least 0.013 solar masses, assuming no significant
dust destruction has occurred in the shell. The IR data also reveal the
presence of an additional plasma component with a cooler temperature,
consistent with the 0.2 keV gas component. Our IR analysis therefore provides
an independent verification of the cooler component of the X-ray emission.

intermediate-band filters covering a wavelength range of 3000--8500 \AA. Based
on aperture photometry, we obtain its SEDs as defined by the 13 BATC filters.
We determine the cluster's age and mass by comparing its SEDs (from 2267 to
20000{\AA}, comprising photometric data in the near-ultraviolet of GALEX, 5
SDSS bands, 13 BATC intermediate-band, and 2MASS near-infrared JHKs} filters)

to explain the cosmic acceleration in a new way. Among these PGT cosmological
models, the one with only even parity dynamical modes -- SNY model, for its
realistic meaning, is very attractive. In this paper, we first analyze the
past-time cosmic evolution of SNY model analytically. And based on these
results we fit this model to the most comprehensive SNeIa data (Union 2) and
thus find the best-fit values of model parameters and initial conditions, whose
related $\chi^{2}$ value is consistent with the one from $\Lambda$CMD at the

based image retrieval. The enormous growth of the internet and the wide use of
digital data have increased the need for both efficient image database creation
and retrieval procedure. This paper describes a new approach for texture
classification by combining statistical texture features of Local Binary
Pattern and Texture spectrum. Since most significant information of a texture
often appears in the high frequency channels, the features are extracted by the
computation of LBP and Texture Spectrum and Legendre Moments. Euclidean
distance is used for similarity measurement. The experimental result shows that
97.77% classification accuracy is obtained by the proposed method.

substantial modifications to a binary's semi-major axis, eccentricity, and
inclination, which we quantify. Encounters within 30 Earth radii typically
occur on sub-million year timescales and significantly affect the wider

away from northwest of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. This paper
presents three types of radiation survey undertaken through the unprecedented
accidents at the campus and the hospital of FMU. First, a group of interested
people immediately began radiation surveillance; the group members were
assembled from the faculty members of ""Life Sciences and Social Medicine"" and
""Human and Natural Sciences"". Second, the present author, regardless of the
earthquake, had serially observed natural radiations such as gamma radiation in
air with NaI scintillation counter, atmospheric radon with Lucas cell, and
second cosmic rays with NaI scintillation. Gamma radiation indicated most
drastic change, i.e., peak value (9.3 times usual level) appeared on March 16,
and decreased to 1.7 times usual level after two months. A nonlinear least
squares regression to this decreasing data gave short half-life of 3.6 days and
long half-life of 181 days. These two apparent half-lives are attributed to two
groups of radioisotopes, i.e., short half-life one of I-131 and long half-life
ones of Cs-134, Cs-137 and Sr-90. Also, atmospheric radon concentration became
high since a stop of ventilation, while second cosmic rays did not show any
response. Third, late April, 2011, a team of radiation dosimetry under the
direct control of Dean, School of Medicine, was established for the

disturbed massive clusters to be used as gravitational lenses for studies of
the distant universe and as probes of particle acceleration mechanisms
resulting in non-thermal radio emission, (b) find cluster mergers featuring
subcluster trajectories that make them suitable for quantitative analyses of
cluster collisions, and (c) constrain the evolution with redshift of the
cluster merger fraction. Finally, (d) this paper represents the third public
release of clusters from the MACS sample, adding 24 clusters to the 46
published previously. To classify clusters by degree of relaxation, we use the
projected offset of the brightest cluster galaxy from the peak (or the global
centroid) of the X-ray emission as a measure of the segregation between the
intracluster gas and dark matter. Regarding (a), we identify ten complex
systems likely to have undergone multiple merger events in the recent past.
Regarding (b), we identify eleven systems likely to be post-collision, binary,
head-on mergers (BHOMs), as well as another six mergers that are possible BHOMs
but probably harder to interpret because of non-negligible impact parameters
and merger axes closer to our line of sight. Regarding (c), we find a highly
significant increase with redshift in the fraction of morphologically disturbed
clusters starting at z \sim 0.4, in spite of a detection bias in our sample
against very disturbed systems at high redshift. A larger sample of clusters
with high-quality X-ray data in particular at high redshift will be needed to
trace the evolutionary history of cluster growth and relaxation closer to the
primary epoch of cluster formation z \sim 1.

observational dataset (Stern et al. 2010, referred to as SJVKS) and the
simulated datasets, to constrain Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) void models.
The necessity of the consistency check on OHD itself in the LTB cosmology is
stressed. Three voids are chosen as test models and are constrained using the
Union2 dataset of SN Ia as well as OHD. Despite their different
parametrization, the results from our test models show some indicating
similarities, e.g., the best-fit voids obtained from OHD are all considerably
broader than those from SN Ia. Due to the small size of the SJVKS dataset, the
constraints are not conclusive. The constraining power of the future OHD
observations are therefore investigated, through a Figure of Merit (FoM)
analysis based on the Monte Carlo simulated data. We found that, in the case
that the future OHD become more consistent with SN Ia, the results from the
test models are almost unanimous: 1) as many as 32 OHD data points at the
SJVKS-like uncertainty level are needed to give a higher FoM than the Union2
dataset of SN Ia; 2) precise observation helps reduce this required number; 3)
increasing the survey depth does not always increase the FoM. On the other
hand, if the future OHD and the Union2 dataset keep favor different voids, in a
similar manner as they do at present, the 1{\sigma} confidence regions obtained
from the two probes should finally separate. We test this conjecture and found
that, the minimum observational requirement (the size of the dataset, the
uncertainty level and the survey depth) for this inconsistency to emerge
depends strongly on the void model.

describing the long- distance properties of lattice QCD with Wilson or

flavors of Wilson fermions or a single light twisted-mass fermion.
Discretization errors introduce three low energy constants (LECs) into
partially quenched WChPT at O(a^2), conventionally called W'_6, W'_7 and W'_8 .
The phase structure of the theory at non-zero a depends on the sign of the
combination 2W'_6 + W'_8, while the spectrum of the lattice Hermitian
Wilson-Dirac operator depends on all three constants. It has been argued, based
on the positivity of partition functions of fixed topological charge, and on
the convergence of graded group integrals that arise in the epsilon-regime of
ChPT, that there is a constraint on the LECs arising from the underlying
lattice theory. In particular, for W'_6 = W'_7 = 0, the constraint found is
W'_8 \le 0. Here we provide an alternative line of argument, based on mass
inequalities for the underlying partially quenched theory. We find that W'_8
\le 0, irrespective of the values of W'_6 and W'_7. Our constraint implies that
2W'_6 > |W'_8| if the phase diagram is to be described by the first-order

the finite hard-core size of baryons has been incorporated in a

model differs from other existing approaches on the following points. We assign
a hard-core volume only to each baryon and mesons though possess a small volume
but they can fuse and interpenetrate into one another. Use of the full quantum
statistics is made in obtaining the grand canonical partition function where
excluded-volume correction has been incorporated by explicitly integrating over
volume. We thus find that the new model works even for the cases of extreme
temperatures and/or densities where most of other approaches fail. The model
does not violate causality even at extreme densities. The temperature and
density dependence of various thermodynamical quantities, e.g. pressure, baryon
density, entropy and energy density compare well with the results of other
microscopic HG models. After suitable parametrization of the centre-of-mass
energy in terms of temperature and baryon chemical potential, we explore some
new freeze-out criteria which exhibit full independence of the collision energy
and of the structures of the colliding nuclei. We further demonstrate the
suitability of our model in explaining various experimental results of the
multiplicity-ratios of various particles and their antiparticles. Finally, we

in the ensuing propagation to the clouds. We focus on the later evolution of
SNRs, when the conventional treatment of the streaming instability is valid but
the magnetic field is enhanced due to either Bell's current instability and/or
due to the dynamo generation of magnetic field in the precursor region. We
calculate the time dependence of the maximum energy of the accelerated
particles. This result is then used to determine the diffusive flux of the
runaway particles escaping the shock region, from which we obtain the gamma
spectrum consistent with observations. Finally, we check the self-consistency
of our results by comparing the required level of diffusion with the level of
the streaming instability attainable in the presence of turbulence damping. The
energy range of cosmic rays subject to the streaming instability is able to
produce the observed energy spectrum of gamma rays.

determined by the spectral density functions of these different environments.

show that these effects are brought about by a quasi-periodic network of

then present results of transport measurements on microstructures of modulation
doped PbTe/(Pb,Eu)Te:Bi heterostructures for which the influence of parasitic

been observed, on similar samples, previously. These structures are of H-shaped

embedded between Pb$_{0.92}$Eu$_{0.08}$Te barriers. The structures have
different lateral sizes corresponding to both diffusive and ballistic electron

This model is written in accordance with the formalism of generalized standard

the flow rule, which describes some stress-strain dependance, coupled to the
heat-transfer equation. More precisely, the coupling terms are linear with
respect to the temperature and the displacement and non linear with respect to

is weak (EW~0.05keV), in agreement with the known trend. In contrast,
high-ionization lines of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI are pronounced. These
high-ionization Fe K lines appear to have a connection with high accretion
rates. While no broad Fe emission is detected in the total spectrum, it might
be present, albeit at low significance, when the X-ray luminosity is restricted
to the range below 3e44 erg/s, or when an intermediate range of Eddington ratio
around 0.1 is selected. In Type II AGN, both cold and high-ionzation lines
become weak with increasing X-ray luminosity. However, strong high-ionization
Fe K (EW~0.3 keV) is detected in the spectrum of objects at z>2, while no 6.4
keV line is found. It is then found that the primary source of the
high-ionization Fe K emission is those objects detected with Spitzer-MIPS at 24
micron. Given their median redshift of z=2.5, their bolometric luminosity is
likely to reach 10^13 Lsun and the MIPS-detected emission most likely
originates from hot dust heated by embedded AGN, probably accreting at high

objects (YSOs) is mandatory for understanding the early stages of the stellar
evolution. This task requires the combination of both spectroscopy and
photometry, covering the widest possible wavelength range, to disentangle the
various protostellar components and activities. As part of the POISSON project,
we present a multi-wavelength spectroscopic and photometric investigation of
embedded YSOs in L1641, aimed to derive the stellar parameters and evolutionary
stages and to infer their accretion properties. Our database includes
low-resolution optical-IR spectra from the NTT and Spitzer (0.6-40 um) and
photometric data covering a spectral range from 0.4 to 1100 um, which allow us
to construct the YSOs spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and to infer the
main stellar parameters. The SED analysis allows us to group our 27 YSOs into
nine Class I, eleven Flat, and seven Class II objects. However, on the basis of
the derived stellar properties, only six Class I YSOs have an age of ~10^5 yr,
while the others are older 5x10^5-10^6 yr), and, among the Flat sources, three
out of eleven are more evolved objects (5x10^6-10^7 yr), indicating that
geometrical effects can significantly modify the SED shapes. Inferred mass
accretion rates (Macc) show a wide range of values (3.6x10^-9 to 1.2x10^-5
M_sun yr^-1), which reflects the age spread observed in our sample. Average
values of mass accretion rates, extinction, and spectral indices decrease with
the YSO class. The youngest YSOs have the highest Macc, whereas the oldest YSOs
do not show any detectable jet activity in either images and spectra. We also
observe a clear correlation among the YSO Macc, M*, and age, consistent with
mass accretion evolution in viscous disc models.

behavior usually results in suboptimal resource utilization. There have been
extensive works that model communication systems with selfish users as one-shot
games and propose incentive schemes to achieve Pareto optimal action profiles
as non-cooperative equilibria. However, in many communication systems, due to
strong negative externalities among users, the sets of feasible payoffs in
one-shot games are nonconvex. Thus, it is possible to expand the set of
feasible payoffs by having users choose convex combinations of different
payoffs. In this paper, we propose a repeated game model generalized by
intervention. First, we use repeated games to convexify the set of feasible
payoffs in one-shot games. Second, we combine conventional repeated games with
intervention, originally proposed for one-shot games, to achieve a larger set
of equilibrium payoffs and loosen requirements for users' patience to achieve
it. We study the problem of maximizing a welfare function defined on users'
equilibrium payoffs, subject to minimum payoff guarantees. Given the optimal
equilibrium payoff, we derive the minimum intervention capability required and
design corresponding equilibrium strategies. The proposed generalized repeated
game model applies to various communication systems, such as power control and
flow control.

the accreting matter falls to the star's surface along the magnetic poles with
a larger mass flow to the leeward pole of the star. In the case of a relatively
large stellar magnetic field, the star's magnetic field is stretched in the

star). For weaker magnetic fields we observed oscillations of the closed
magnetosphere frontward and backward. These are accompanied by strong
oscillations of the mass accretion rate which varies by factors ~ 3. Old slowly
rotating neutron stars with no radio emission may be visible in the X-ray band
due to accretion of interstellar matter. In general, the star's velocity,
magnetic moment, and angular velocity vectors may all be in different
directions so that the accretion luminosity will be modulated at the star's

demonstrated their potential influence on the mass and angular momentum of
protoplanetary discs around young stars. In this study it is investigated in
how far the initial surface density in the disc surrounding a young star
influences the outcome of an encounter. Based on a power-law ansatz for the
surface density, $\Sigma(r) \propto r^{-p}$, a parameter study of star-disc
encounters with different initial disc-mass distributions has been performed
using N-body simulations. It is demonstrated that the shape of the disc-mass
distribution has a significant impact on the quantity of the disc-mass and
angular momentum losses in star-disc encounters. Most sensitive are the results
where the outer parts of the disc are perturbed by high-mass stars. By
contrast, disc-penetrating encounters lead more or less independently of the
disc-mass distribution always to large losses. However, maximum losses are
generally obtained for initially flat distributed disc material. Based on the
parameter study a fit formula is derived, describing the relative mass and
angular momentum loss dependent on the initial disc-mass distribution index p.
Generally encounters lead to a steepening of the density profile of the disc.
The resulting profiles can have a r^{-2}-dependence or even steeper independent
of the initial distribution of the disc material. From observations the initial
density distribution in discs remains unconstrained, so the here demonstrated
strong dependence on the initial density distribution might require a revision
of the effect of encounters in young stellar clusters. The steep surface
density distributions induced by some encounters might be the prerequisite to
form planetary systems similar to our own solar system.

aspects of this model in the presence of noncommutative Schwarzschild black
hole by applying the method of coordinate coherent states describing smeared
structures. We implement two different distributions: (a) Gaussian and (b)
Lorentzian. Both mass distributions prepare the similar quantitative aspects
for the entropic force. Our study shows, the entropic force on the smallest
fundamental unit of a holographic screen with radius $r_0$ vanishes. As a
result, black hole remnants are unconditionally inert even gravitational
interactions do not exist therein. So, a distinction between gravitational and
inertial mass in the size of black hole remnant is observed, i.e. the failure
of the principle of equivalence. In addition, if one considers the screen
radius to be less than the radius of the smallest holographic surface at the
Planckian regime, then one encounters some unusual dynamical features leading
to gravitational repulsive force and negative energy. On the other hand, the
significant distinction between the two distributions is conceived to occur
around $r_0$, and that is worth of mentioning: at this regime either our
analysis is not the proper one, or non-extensive statistics should be employed.

`multiplets') which exhibit a correlation between arrival direction and the
inverse of the energy. These signatures are expected from sets of events coming
from the same source after having been deflected by intervening coherent
magnetic fields. The observation of several events from the same source would
open the possibility to accurately reconstruct the position of the source and
also measure the integral of the component of the magnetic field orthogonal to
the trajectory of the cosmic rays. We describe the largest multiplets found and
compute the probability that they appeared by chance from an isotropic
distribution. We find no statistically significant evidence for the presence of
multiplets arising from magnetic deflections in the present data.

gaseous circumstellar disk that is responsible for the observed infrared-excess
and emission lines. The phenomena involved in the disk formation still remain
highly debated. Aims. To progress in the understanding of the physical process
or processes responsible for the mass ejections and test the hypothesis that
they depend on the stellar parameters, we initiated a survey on the
circumstellar environment of the brightest Be stars. Methods. To achieve this
goal, we used spectro-interferometry, the only technique that combines high
spectral (R=12000) and high spatial ($\theta_{\rm min}$=4\,mas) resolutions.
Observations were carried out at the Paranal observatory with the VLTI/AMBER
instrument. We concentrated our observations on the Br$\gamma$ emission line to
be able to study the kinematics within the circumstellar disk. Our sample is
composed of eight bright classical Be stars : $\alpha$ Col, $\kappa$ CMa,
$\omega$ Car, p Car, $\delta$ Cen, $\mu$ Cen, $\alpha$ Ara, and \textit{o} Aqr.
Results. We managed to determine the disk extension in the line and the nearby
continuum for most targets. We also constrained the disk kinematics, showing
that it is dominated by rotation with a rotation law close to the Keplerian
one. Our survey also suggests that these stars are rotating at a mean velocity
of V/V$_{\rm c}$\,=\,0.82\,$\pm$\,0.08. This corresponds to a rotational rate
of $\Omega/\Omega_{\rm c}$\,=\,0.95\,$\pm$\,0.02 Conclusions. We did not detect
any correlation between the stellar parameters and the structure of the
circumstellar environment. Moreover, it seems that a simple model of a
geometrically thin Keplerian disk can explain most of our spectrally resolved
K-band data. Nevertheless, some small departures from this model have been
detected for at least two objects (i.e, $\kappa$ CMa and $\alpha$ Col).
Finally, our Be stars sample suggests that rotation is the main physical
process driving the mass-ejection. Nevertheless, smaller effects from other
mechanisms have to be taken into account to fully explain how the residual
gravity is compensated.

with the amplitude of the signal being largest at solar maximum. The amplitude
of the signal is noticeably larger for the l=2 and 3 modes than for the l=0 and
1 modes. The seismic QBO shows some frequency dependence but this dependence is
not as strong as observed in the 11-yr solar cycle. These results are
consistent with the seismic QBO having its origins in shallow layers of the
interior (one possibility being the bottom of the shear layer extending 5per
cent below the solar surface). Under this scenario the magnetic flux
responsible for the seismic QBO is brought to the surface (where its influence
on the p modes is stronger) by buoyant flux from the 11-yr cycle, the strong
component of which is observed at predominantly low-latitudes. As the l=2 and 3

the influence of the 11-yr cycle on the seismic QBO is more visible in l=2 and

where the strong component of the 11-yr solar cycle resides. To isolate the

simulate the focused/defocused pairs of images used by the phase-diversity

that standard optimization methods are able to infer the projection of the
wavefront on the Zernike polynomials with 10% precision. We also consider the
less favorable case of 25% precision. We obtain reconstructed monochromatic
modulated images that are later demodulated and compared with the original
maps. Although asymmetries are often difficult to define in the quiet Sun due
to the complexity of the Stokes V profiles, we show how asymmetries are
degraded with spatial and spectral smearing. The results indicate that,

started about 2 months after the supernova explosion, highlight significant
differences between SN 2009E and the prototypical SN 1987A. Modelling the data
of SN 2009E allows us to constrain the explosion parameters and the properties
of the progenitor star, and compare the inferred estimates with those available
for the similar SNe 1987A and 1998A. The light curve of SN 2009E is less
luminous than that of SN 1987A and the other members of this class, and the
maximum light curve peak is reached at a slightly later epoch than in SN 1987A.
Late-time photometric observations suggest that SN 2009E ejected about 0.04
solar masses of 56Ni, which is the smallest 56Ni mass in our sample of
1987A-like events. Modelling the observations with a radiation hydrodynamics
code, we infer for SN 2009E a kinetic plus thermal energy of about 0.6 foe, an
initial radius of ~7 x 10^12 cm and an ejected mass of ~19 solar masses. The
photospheric spectra show a number of narrow (v~1800 km/s) metal lines, with
unusually strong Ba II lines. The nebular spectrum displays narrow emission
lines of H, Na I, [Ca II] and [O I], with the [O I] feature being relatively
strong compared to the [Ca II] doublet. The overall spectroscopic evolution is
reminiscent of that of the faint 56Ni-poor type II-plateau supernovae. This
suggests that SN 2009E belongs to the low-luminosity, low 56Ni mass, low-energy
tail in the distribution of the 1987A-like objects in the same manner as SN
1997D and similar events represent the faint tail in the distribution of
physical properties for normal type II-plateau supernovae.

reconstruct the complete spatio-temporal microcracking dynamics, with
micrometer / nanosecond resolution, through post mortem analysis of the
fracture surfaces. We find that all individual microcracks propagate at the

microcracks is not to slow down fracture by increasing the energy required for
crack propagation, as commonly believed, but on the contrary to boost the
macroscale velocity through an acceleration factor selected on geometric
grounds. Our results emphasize the key role of damage-related internal

network by Lim, Kim, El Gamal and Chung. This scheme builds on compress-forward
(CF) relaying but involves three new ideas, namely no Wyner-Ziv binning,
relaxed simultaneous decoding and message repetition. In this paper, using the
two-way relay channel as the underlining example, we analyze the impact of each
of these ideas on the achievable rate region of relay networks. First, CF
without binning but with joint decoding of both the message and compression
index can achieve a larger rate region than the original CF scheme for
multi-destination relay networks. With binning and successive decoding, the
compression rate at each relay is constrained by the weakest link from the
relay to a destination; but without binning, this constraint is relaxed.
Second, simultaneous decoding of all messages over all blocks without uniquely
decoding the compression indices can remove the constraints on compression rate
completely, but is still subject to the message block boundary effect. Third,
message repetition is necessary to overcome this boundary effect and achieve
the noisy network coding region for multi-source networks. The rate region is
enlarged with increasing repetition times. We also apply CF without binning
specifically to the one-way and two-way relay channels and analyze the rate
regions in detail. For the one-way relay channel, it achieves the same rate as
the original CF and noisy network coding but has only 1 block decoding delay.
For the two-way relay channel, we derive the explicit channel conditions in the
Gaussian and fading cases for CF without binning to achieve the same rate
region or sum rate as noisy network coding. These analyses may be appealing to

with feedback loop. We find that feedback results in oscillation death both in
small sets or large ensembles. More importantly, the death zone in parameter
space is significantly enlarged and oscillation death could occur even in
coupled identical oscillators in the presence of feedback. We find that there
are two different ways to oscillation death, namely desynchronization and
completely synchronization induced oscillation death. Feedback induced
oscillation death may be used to suppress unexpected oscillations, e.g., in
chaotic laser arrays.

recent years, due to its importance in applications such as wireless sensor
networks and structural biology. In this paper, we extend on previous work and
propose the 3D-ASAP algorithm, for the graph realization problem in
$\mathbb{R}^3$, given a sparse and noisy set of distance measurements. 3D-ASAP
is a divide and conquer, non-incremental and non-iterative algorithm, which
integrates local distance information into a global structure determination.
Our approach starts with identifying, for every node, a subgraph of its 1-hop
neighborhood graph, which can be accurately embedded in its own coordinate
system. In the noise-free case, the computed coordinates of the sensors in each
patch must agree with their global positioning up to some unknown rigid motion,
that is, up to translation, rotation and possibly reflection. In other words,
to every patch there corresponds an element of the Euclidean group Euc(3) of
rigid transformations in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and the goal is to estimate the group
elements that will properly align all the patches in a globally consistent way.
Furthermore, 3D-ASAP successfully incorporates information specific to the
molecule problem in structural biology, in particular information on known
substructures and their orientation. In addition, we also propose 3D-SP-ASAP, a
faster version of 3D-ASAP, which uses a spectral partitioning algorithm as a
preprocessing step for dividing the initial graph into smaller subgraphs. Our
extensive numerical simulations show that 3D-ASAP and 3D-SP-ASAP are very
robust to high levels of noise in the measured distances and to sparse
connectivity in the measurement graph, and compare favorably to similar
state-of-the art localization algorithms.

solution $f$ (with the same total density $\rho$ at the fixed moment $t$) of
Boltzmann equation is introduced. In this way we essentially generalize the
important Kullback-Leibler distance, which was used before. Namely, we
generalize it for the spatially inhomogeneous case. An extremal problem to find
a solution of the Boltzmann equation, such that $\dist\{M,f\}$ is minimal in
the class of solutions with the fixed values of energy and of $n$ moments, is
solved. The cases of the classical and quantum (for Fermi and Bose particles)
Boltzmann equations are studied and compared. The asymptotics and stability of
solutions of the Boltzmann equations are also considered.
