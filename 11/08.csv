environment-induced error and is a fundamental limit to the fidelity of quantum
operations. In the scattering process the qubit loses its distinctive and
coherent character owing to its entanglement with the photon. Using a single
trapped ion we show that by utilizing the information carried by the photon we
are able to coherently reverse this process and correct for the scattering

show similar lithium abundances to normal giants at the same gravity. We
further included two metal-poor, Li-rich globular cluster giants in our sample,
namely the previously discovered M3-IV101 and newly discovered (in this work)
M68-A96. This comprises the largest sample of metal-poor Li-rich giants to
date. We performed a detailed abundance analysis of all stars, finding that the
majority our sample stars have elemental abundances similar to that of
Li-normal halo giants. Although the evolutionary phase of each Li-rich giant
cannot be definitively determined, the Li-rich phase is likely connected to
extra mixing at the red giant branch bump or early asymptotic giant branch that
triggers cool bottom processing in which the bottom of the outer convective
envelope is connected to the H-burning shell in the star. The surface of a star
becomes Li-enhanced as 7Be (which burns to 7Li) is transported to the stellar
surface via the Cameron-Fowler mechanism. We discuss and discriminate among
several models for the extra mixing that can cause Li-production, given the
detailed abundances of the Li-rich giants in our sample.

a consequence, the frequency evolution in transients has received much less
attention than the wave energy density or growth factor. By carrying out a
large number of long term transient simulations for longitudinal, oblique and
orthogonal perturbations in the plane channel and wake flows, we could observe
a complex time evolution of the frequency. The complexity is mainly associated
to jumps which appear quite far along within the transients. We interpret these
jumps as the transition between the early transient and the beginning of an
intermediate term that reveals itself for times large enough for the influence
of the fine details of the initial condition to disappear. The intermediate
term leads to the asymptotic exponential state and has a duration one order of
magnitude longer than the early term, which indicates the existence of an
intermediate asymptotics. Since after the intermediate term perturbations die
out or blowup, the mid-term can be considered as the most probable state in the
perturbation life. Long structured transients can be related to the spot
patterns commonly observed in subcritical transitional wall flows. By
considering a large group of 3D waves in a narrow range of wavenumbers, we
superposed them in a finite temporal window with oblique and longitudinal waves
randomly delayed with respect to an orthogonal wave which is supposed to
sustain the spot formation with its intense transient growth. We show that in
this way it is possible to recover the linear initial evolution of the pattern
characterized by the presence of longitudinal streaks. We also determined the
asymptotic frequency and phase speed wavenumber spectra for the channel and
wake flows. The mild dispersion observed can in part explain the different
propagation speeds of the backward and forward fronts of the spot.

contribution of this paper is twofold, first we propose a variation on the

but with less communication. Our solution is based on deriving new challenges
from the secret key through cyclic shifts of the initial public key syndrome; a
new proof of soundness for this case is given Secondly we propose a new way to
deal with hashed commitments in zero-knowledge schemes based on Stern's scheme,
so that in terms of communication, on the average, only one hash value is sent
rather than two or three. Overall our new scheme has the good features of
having a zero-knowledge security proof based on well known hard problem of
coding theory, a small size of secret and public key (a few hundred bits), a
small calculation complexity, for an overall communication cost of 19kb for
authentication (for a $2^{16}$ security) and a signature of size of 93kb

intramolecular chain of seven iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters, one of the longest

ET to incorporate both semi-classical and coherent quantum phenomena using a
quantum master equation based on the Holstein Hamiltonian. We test our model on
the structurally-defined chain of FeS clusters in complex I. By exploring a
wide range of realistic parameters we find that, when the energy profile for ET
along the chain is relatively flat, just a small coherent contribution can
provide a robust and significant increase in ET rate (above the semi-classical
diffusive-hopping rate), even at physiologically-relevant temperatures.
Conversely, when the on-site energies vary significantly along the chain the
coherent contribution is negligible. For complex I, a crucial respiratory
enzyme that is linked to many neuromuscular and degenerative diseases, our
results suggest a new contribution towards ensuring that intramolecular ET does
not limit the rate of catalysis. For the emerging field of quantum biology, our
model is intended as a basis for elucidating the general role of coherent ET in
biological ET reactions.

alternative for future generation wireless broadband services in order to meet

Evolution (LTE), MIMO technologies have been broadly used to get better
downlink peak rate, cell coverage, as well as average cell throughput. In the
present paper a 2x2 MIMO is taken as baseline configuration for a LTE downlink
under a Microcellular propagation scenario considering a non physical
correlation based channel with Poor and rich scattering environment. The
throughput capacity of the downlink is obtained for poor and rich scattering
environments. Besides, two vital aspects of MIMO technique viz Spatial
Multiplexing (SM) and Transmit Diversity (TD) are investigated in order to see
their effect on throughput of the system. The effect of parameters like Speed
of mobile station, number of Multipath, Rician factor (K) on throughput of such
systems is reported and discussed. The investigations reported in this paper
helps in estimating the throughput capacity of LTE downlink under SM and TD

reionization can be either: (A) externally-driven and uniform, or (B)
internally-driven, by the most massive progenitor of the Milky Way. In the
latter scenario the propagation of the ionisation front and photon dilution
introduce a delay in the photo-evaporation of the outer satellites' gas with
respect to the inner satellites. As a consequence, outer satellites experience
a longer period of star formation than those in the inner halo. We use simple
models to account for star formation, the propagation of the ionisation front,
photo-evaporation and observational biases. Both scenarios yield a model
satellite population that matches the observed luminosity function and
mass-to-light ratios. However, the predicted population for scenario (B) is
significantly more extended spatially than for scenario (A), by about 0.3 dex
in distance, resulting in a much better match to the observations. The survival
of the signature left by the local UV field during reionization on the radial
distribution of satellites makes it a promising tool for studying the
reionization epoch at galaxy scale in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies
resolved in stars with forthcoming large surveys.

the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE). As LTE is a MIMO-OFDM based
system, a cyclic prefix is inserted at the beginning of each transmitted OFDM
symbol in order to completely suppress both inter-carrier interference (ICI)
and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Usually, the cyclic prefix is equal to or
longer than the channel length but in some cases and because of some unforeseen
channel behaviour, the cyclic prefix can be shorter. Therefore, we propose to
study the performance of the two linear estimators under the effect of the
channel length. Computer simulations show that, in the case where the cyclic
prefix is equal to or longer than the channel length,LMMSE performs better than
LSE but at the cost of computational complexity.In the other case, LMMSE
continue to improve its performance only for low SNR values but it degrades for
high SNR values in which LS shows better performance for LTE Downlink systems.
MATLAB Monte-Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the
studied estimators in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error Rate (BER)

pulsational variability in much more detail than was previously possible from
the ground. We present a first general characterization of the variability of
A-F type stars as observed in the Kepler light curves of a sample of 750
candidate A-F type stars, and investigate the relation between gamma Doradus,
delta Scuti, and hybrid stars. Our results imply an investigation of pulsation
mechanisms to supplement the kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to
drive hybrid pulsations and suggest a revision of the current observational
instability strips of delta Scuti and gamma Doradus stars if the currently
available values of effective temperature and surface gravity will be

the dipole axis, through field-line sweepback near the light cylinder or
non-symmetric currents within the star. The effects of such offsets on
electron-positron pair cascades are investigated, using simple models of dipole
magnetic fields with small distortions that shift the PCs by different amounts
or directions. Using a Monte Carlo pair cascade simulation, we explore the
changes in the pair spectrum, multiplicity and energy flux across the PC, as
well as the trends in pair flux and pair energy flux with spin-down luminosity,
L_{sd}. We also give an estimate of the distribution of heating flux from
returning positrons on the PC for different offsets. We find that even modest
offsets can produce significant increases in pair multiplicity, especially for
pulsars that are near or beyond the pair death lines for centered PCs,
primarily because of higher accelerating fields. Pair spectra cover several
decades in energy, with the spectral range of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) two
orders of magnitude higher than for normal pulsars, and PC offsets allow
significant extension of all spectra to lower pair energies. We find that the
total PC pair luminosity L_{pair} is proportional to L_{sd}, with L_{pair} ~
10^{-3} L_{sd} for normal pulsars and L_{pair} ~ 10^{-2} L_{sd} for MSPs.
Remarkably, the total PC heating luminosity for even large offsets increases by
less than a factor of two, even though the PC area increases by much larger
factors, because most of the heating occurs near the magnetic axis.

Monte Carlo simulations on two-dimensional square lattices to explore the
temporal evolution characteristics of two different interacting three-species
predator-prey systems: (1) a cyclic rock-paper-scissors (RPS) model with
conserved total particle number but strongly asymmetric reaction rates that
lets the system evolve towards one corner of configuration space; (2) a
hierarchical food chain where an additional intermediate species is inserted
between the predator and prey in the LV model. For model variant (1), we
demonstrate that the evolutionary properties of both minority species in the
steady state of this stochastic spatial three-species corner RPS model are well
approximated by the LV system, with its emerging characteristic features of
localized population clustering, persistent oscillatory dynamics, correlated
spatio-temporal patterns, and fitness enhancement through quenched spatial
disorder in the predation rates. In contrast, we could not identify any regime
where the hierarchical model (2) would reduce to the two-species LV system. In
the presence of pair exchange processes, the system remains essentially
well-mixed, and we generally find the Monte Carlo simulation results for the
spatially extended model (2) to be consistent with the predictions from the
corresponding mean-field rate equations. If spreading occurs only through
nearest-neighbor hopping, small population clusters emerge; yet the requirement
of an intermediate species cluster obviously disrupts spatio-temporal
correlations between predator and prey, and correspondingly eliminates many of
the intriguing fluctuation phenomena that characterize the stochastic spatial
LV system.

in networks of photosynthetic complexes. We take inspiration from light
harvesting networks present in purple bacteria and simulate an incoherent
dissipative energy transport process on more general and abstract networks,
considering both regular structures (Cayley trees and hyperbranched fractals)
and randomly-generated ones. We focus on the the two primary light harvesting
complexes of purple bacteria, i.e., the LH1 and LH2, and we use
network-theoretical centrality measures in order to select different LH1
arrangements. We show that different choices cause significant differences in
the transport efficiencies, and that for regular networks centrality measures
allow to identify arrangements that ensure transport efficiencies which are
better than those obtained with a random disposition of the complexes. The
optimal arrangements strongly depend on the dissipative nature of the dynamics
and on the topological properties of the networks considered, and depending on
the latter they are achieved by using global vs. local centrality measures. For
randomly-generated networks a random arrangement of the complexes already
provides efficient transport, and this suggests the process is strong with
respect to limited amount of control in the structure design and to the
disorder inherent in the construction of randomly-assembled structures.
Finally, we compare the networks considered with the real biological networks
and find that the latter have in general better performances, due to their
higher connectivity, but the former with optimal arrangements can mimic the
real networks' behaviour for a specific range of transport parameters. These
results show that the use of network-theoretical concepts can be crucial for
the characterization and design of efficient artificial energy transport
networks.

physics of radiative cooling, coronal heating and ionization, which allow us to
produce a more realistic model of the solar atmosphere. The simulation
illustrates the process by which magnetic flux emerges at the photosphere and
coalesces to form two large concentrations of opposite polarities. We find that
the large-scale convective motion in the convection zone is critical to form
and maintain sunspots, while the horizontal converging flows in the near
surface layer prevent the concentrated polarities from separating. The foot
points of the sunspots in the convection zone exhibit a coherent rotation
motion, resulting in the increasing helicity of the coronal field. Here, the
local configuration of the convection causes the convergence of opposite
polarities of magnetic flux with a shearing flow along the polarity inversion
line. During the rising of the flux rope, the magnetic energy is first injected
through the photosphere by the emergence, followed by energy transport by
horizontal flows, after which the energy is subducted back to the convection
zone by the submerging flows.

were in vacuum, this quark would radiate a beam of strongly coupled radiation
whose angular distribution has been characterized and is very similar to that
of synchrotron radiation produced by an electron in circular motion in
electrodynamics. Here, we watch this beam of gluons getting quenched by the
strongly coupled plasma. We find that a beam of gluons of momenta $\sim q \gg
\pi T$ is attenuated rapidly, over a distance $\sim q^{1/3} (\pi T)^{-4/3}$ in
a plasma with temperature $T$. As the beam propagates through the plasma at the
speed of light, it sheds trailing sound waves with momenta $\lesssim \pi T$.
Presumably these sound waves would thermalize in the plasma if they were not
hit soon after their production by the next pulse of gluons from the
lighthouse-like rotating quark. At larger and larger $q$, the trailing sound
wave becomes less and less prominent. The outward going beam of gluon radiation
itself shows no tendency to spread in angle or to shift toward larger
wavelengths, even as it is completely attenuated. In this regard, the behavior
of the beam of gluons that we analyze is reminiscent of the behavior of jets

star formation rate (SFR). Progress in using it as a cosmic SFR tracer requires
some confidence that it is consistent with more conventional SFR diagnostics in
the nearby Universe. This paper compares standard SFR measurements based on
Halpha, FUV and TIR galaxy luminosities with the observed CCSN rate in the same
galaxy sample. The comparison can be viewed from two perspectives. Firstly, by
adopting an estimate of the minimum stellar mass to produce a CCSN one can
determine a SFR from SN numbers. Secondly, the radiative SFRs can be assumed to
be robust and then the SN statistics provide a constrain on the minimum stellar
mass for CCSN progenitors. The novel aspect of this study is that Halpha, FUV
and TIR luminosities are now available for a complete galaxy sample within the
local 11Mpc volume and the number of discovered SNe in this sample within the
last 13 years is high enough to perform a meaningful statistical comparison. We
exploit the multi-wavelength dataset from 11HUGS, a volume-limited survey
designed to provide a census of SFR in the local Volume. Assuming a lower limit
for CCSN progenitors of 8 Msun, the CCSN rate matches the SFR from the FUV
luminosity. However the SFR based on Halpha luminosity is lower than these two
estimates by a factor of nearly 2. If we assume that the FUV or Halpha based
luminosities are a true reflection of the SFR, we find that the minimum mass
for CCSN progenitors is 8 +/- 1 Msun, and 6 +/- 1 Msun, respectively. The
estimate of the minimum mass for CCSN progenitors obtained exploiting FUV data
is in good agreement with that from the direct detection of CCSN progenitors.
The concordant results by these independent methods point toward a constraint
of 8 +/- 1 Msun on the lower mass limit for progenitor stars of CCSNe.

X-ray galaxy clusters, given gas mass M_gas, luminosity L and temperature T. We
find a locus in the plane of the logarithmic slopes $a$ and $b$ of the scaling
relations where the scatter in mass is minimized. This locus corresponds to b_M
= -3/2 a_M +3/2 and b_L = -2 a_L +3/2 for A=M_gas and L, respectively, and B=T.
Along these axes, all the known scaling relations can be identified (at
different levels of scatter), plus a new one defined as M_tot ~ (LT)^(1/2).
Simple formula to evaluate the expected evolution with redshift in the
self-similar scenario are provided. In this scenario, no evolution of the
scaling relations is predicted for the cases (b_M=0, a_M=1) and (b_L=7/2,
a_L=-1), respectively. Once the single quantities are normalized to the average
values of the sample under considerations, the normalizations K corresponding
to the region with minimum scatter are very close to zero. The combination of
these relations allows to reduce the number of free parameters of the fitting
function that relates X-ray observables to the total mass and includes the
self-similar redshift evolution.

measurement uncertainty by reducing the measurement uncertainty of one property

demonstrated in optical fields and later with ensembles of pseudo spin-1/2
atoms using non-linear atom-light interactions. Recently, collisional
interactions in ultracold atomic gases have been used to generate a large
degree of quadrature spin squeezing in two-component Bose condensates. For
pseudo spin-1/2 systems, the complementary properties are the different
components of the total spin vector <S>, which fully characterize the state on
an SU(2) Bloch sphere. Here, we measure squeezing in a spin-1 Bose condensate,
an SU(3) system, which requires measurement of the rank-2 nematic or quadrupole
tensor <Q_ij> as well to fully characterize the state. Following a quench
through a nematic to ferromagnetic quantum phase transition, squeezing is
observed in the variance of the quadratures up to -8.3(-0.7 +0.6) dB

the functions, the loop integral \Omega^{(2)}, also plays a key role in a new
representation of the remainder function R_6^{(2)} in the maximally helicity
violating sector. Another interesting feature at two loops is the appearance of
a new (parity odd) \times (parity odd) sector of the amplitude, which is absent
at one loop, and which is uniquely determined in a natural way in terms of the
more familiar (parity even) \times (parity even) part. The second
non-polylogarithmic function, the loop integral \tilde{\Omega}^{(2)},
characterizes this sector. Both \Omega^{(2)} and tilde{\Omega}^{(2)} can be
expressed as one-dimensional integrals over classical polylogarithms with
rational arguments.

colours, as I-K' primarily measures a populations' metallicity and is
relatively insensitive, unlike optical spectroscopy, to the effect of hot
horizontal branch (HB) stars, known to be present in massive old GCs. We derive
GCs' photometric age, Z and masses. In general, metal-poor ([Z/H]<-0.7dex) GCs
are older than more metal-rich GCs. For the most massive GCs (M>6x10^5 M_sol)
in NGC 3610 with available spectroscopic data, photometric ages are older by ~2
Gyr, and this difference is more pronounced for the metal-poor GCs. However,
photometric and spectroscopic metallicities are in good agreement. We suggest
that this indicates the presence of a hot HB in these massive clusters, which
renders spectroscopic ages from Balmer line strengths to be underestimated. To
support this suggestion we show that all Galactic GCs with M>6x10^5 M_sol
feature hot HBs, except 47 Tuc. Using the relation between the most massive GC
mass and the galaxy's SFR, we find that the galaxies' peak SFR was attained at
the epoch of the formation of the oldest (metal-poor) GCs. Age and [Z/H]
distributions of the metal-rich GCs are broad, indicating prolonged galaxy star
formation histories. The peak value of the age and [Z/H] distributions of the
GCs correlates with host galaxy integrated age and [Z/H], showing that GCs can
indeed be used as relevant proxies of the star formation histories of
galaxies.(Abridged)

distribution of HVCs around the Milky Way and M31 can be modeled by a radial
exponential decline of the mean HI volume filling factor in their halos. Our
model suggests a characteristic radial extent of HVCs of R_halo=50 kpc, a total
HI mass in HVCs of ~10^8 M_sun, and a neutral-gas-accretion rate of ~0.7
M_sun/yr for M31/Milky-Way-type galaxies. Using a Holmberg-like luminosity
scaling of the halo size of galaxies we estimate R_halo=110 kpc for the most
massive galaxies. The total absorption-cross section of HVCs at z=0 most likely
is dominated by galaxies with total HI masses between 10^8.5 and 10^10 M_sun.
Our model indicates that the HI disks of galaxies and their surrounding HVC
population can account for 30-100 percent of intervening QSO absorption-line
systems with log N(HI)>17.5 at z=0. We estimate that the neutral-gas accretion
rate density of galaxies at low redshift from infalling HVCs is
dM_HI/dt/dV=0.022 M_sun/yr/Mpc^3, which is close to the measured star-formation
rate density in the local Universe. HVCs thus may play an important role for
the on-going formation and evolution of galaxies.

luminosity-weighted age, metallicity and alpha-enhancement between the
(pseudo)bulge, inner bar and outer bar, finding that the three structures are
nearly coeval and old. Moreover, the bulge and inner bar present the same
metallicity and overabundance, whereas the outer bar tends to be less

the classical secular scenario in which gas and star formation play a major

them elusive for current instruments. Our simulations show that the radial

the abundance of radio relics, i.e. steep-spectrum diffuse radio emission
coming from the periphery of galaxy clusters, which are believed to trace shock
waves induced by cluster mergers. With the advent of comprehensive relic
samples a framework is needed to analyze statistically the relic abundance. To
this end, we introduce the probability to find a relic located in a galaxy
cluster with given mass and redshift allowing us to relate the halo mass
function of the Universe with the radio relic number counts. Up to date about
45 relics have been reported and we compile the resulting counts, N(>S_1.4). In
principle, the parameters of the distribution could be determined using a
sufficiently large relic sample. However, since the number of known relics is
still small for that purpose we use the MareNostrum Universe simulation to
determine the relic radio power scaling with cluster mass and redshift. Our
model is able to reproduce the recently found tentative evidence for an
increase in the fraction of clusters hosting relics, both with X-ray luminosity
and redshift, using an X-ray flux limited cluster sample. Moreover, we find
that a considerable fraction of faint relics (S_1.4 < ~10 mJy) reside in
clusters with an X-ray flux below ~3e-12 erg/s/cm^2. Finally, we estimate the
number of radio relics which await discovery by future low frequency surveys
proposed for LOFAR and WSRT. We estimate that the WODAN survey proposed for
WSRT may discover 900 relics and that the LOFAR-Tier 1-120 MHz survey may
discover about 2500 relics. However, the actual number of newly discovered

stellar models for the three clusters match the observed effective temperatures
on the giant branches, the oxygen-rich to carbon-rich transition luminosities,
and the AGB-tip luminosities. A major finding is that a large amount of
convective overshoot (up to 3 pressure scale heights) is required at the base
of the convective envelope during third dredge-up in order to get the correct
oxygen-rich to carbon-rich transition luminosity. The stellar evolution
sequences are used as input for detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. For NGC
1978 and NGC 1846 we compare our model results to the observationally derived
abundances of carbon and oxygen. We find that additional mixing processes
(extra-mixing) are required to explain the observed abundance patterns. For NGC
1846 we conclude that non-convective extra-mixing processes are required on
both the RGB and the AGB, in agreement with previous studies. For NGC 1978 it
is possible to explain the C/O and 12C/13C abundances of both the O-rich and
the C-rich AGB stars by assuming that the material in the intershell region
contains high abundances of both C and O. This may occur during a thermal pulse
when convective overshoot at the inner edge of the flash-driven convective
pocket dredges C and O from the core to the intershell. For NGC 419 we provide

stellar disk is complex, and has been difficult to dissect with local
spectroscopic or global photometric data. Here, we develop and apply a rigorous
density modeling approach for Galactic spectroscopic surveys that enables
investigation of the global spatial structure of stellar sub-populations in
narrow bins of [\alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H], using 23,767 G-type dwarfs from
SDSS/SEGUE. We fit models for the number density of each such mono-abundance
component, properly accounting for the complex spectroscopic SEGUE sampling of
the underlying stellar population. We find that each mono-abundance
sub-population has a simple spatial structure that can be described by a single
exponential in both the vertical and radial direction, with continuously
increasing scale heights (~200 pc to 1 kpc) and decreasing scale lengths (>4.5
kpc to 2 kpc) for increasingly older sub-populations, as indicated by their
lower metallicities and [\alpha/Fe] enhancements. That the abundance-selected
sub-components with the largest scale heights have the shortest scale lengths
is in sharp contrast with purely geometric `thick--thin disk' decompositions.
To the extent that [\alpha/Fe] is an adequate proxy for age, our results
directly show that older disk sub-populations are more centrally concentrated,
which implies inside-out formation of galactic disks. The fact that the largest
scale-height sub-components are most centrally concentrated in the Milky Way is
an almost inevitable consequence of explaining the vertical structure of the
disk through internal evolution. Whether the simple spatial structure of the
mono-abundance sub-components, and the striking correlations between age, scale
length, and scale height can be plausibly explained by satellite accretion or
other external heating remains to be seen.

mass of passive galaxies at Log(M/M_sun)< 10.5. The gradual diminishing of the
effect when moving to groups of increasing total masses indicates that the
growing influence of the environment in bound structures is responsible for the
build up of a quenched component at Log(M/M_sun)< 10.5. Differently, the
stellar mass distribution of star forming galaxies is similar in shape in all
the environments, and can be described by a single Schechter function both in

Nevertheless at z=0.2-0.4 groups with M_200<6x10^13 Msun (low mass groups) tend
to have a characteristic mass for star forming galaxies which is 50% higher

environmental processes in such systems. Furthermore we analyse the
distribution of sSFR--Log(M) in groups and in the field, and find that groups
show on average a lower sSFR (by ~0.2 dex) at z<0.8. Accordingly, we find that
the fraction of star forming galaxies is increasing with redshift in all

highlights that low mass groups have a higher fraction (by 50%) of the stellar
mass locked in star forming galaxies than higher mass systems (i.e. 2/3 of

vanishes for galaxies with bulge mass log M < 10.1 M_Sun while for more massive

We also find twice as much AGN among barred galaxies, as compared to unbarred

that the presence of bars affect the mean stellar ages of bulges. This lends
strong support to models in which bars trigger star formation activity in the

suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the global structure
and kinematics of stellar spheroids of Milky Way mass disc galaxies. Font et
al. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully
reproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surface
brightness profiles of the spheroids of the Milky Way and M31. A key to the
success of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from
stars that formed in situ. While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,
stars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r < ~30 kpc. In
the present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a
proto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by
dynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its
origin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely
net prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid
component built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ
component has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation. We
make comparisons with measurements of the shape and kinematics of local
galaxies, including the Milky Way and M31, and stacked observations of more
distant galaxies. We find that the simulated disc galaxies have spheroids of
the correct shape (oblate with a median axis ratio of ~0.6 at radii of < ~30
kpc, but note there is significant system-to-system scatter in this quantity)
and that the kinematics show evidence for two components (due to in situ vs.
accreted), as observed. Our findings therefore add considerable weight to the
importance of dissipative processes in the formation of stellar haloes and to
the notion of a 'dual stellar halo'.

the modulus of continuity of coefficients (but not on their $L^{\infty}$-norm).
Our proof provides the analytic counterpart to the probabilistic proof used in
Priola and Wang (J. Funct. Anal. 2006) to get this type of gradient estimates
in the linear case. We actually extend such estimates to the case of possibly
unbounded data and solutions as well as to the case of nonlinear operators

regularizing effect (at time $t>0$) and the possible conservation of Lipschitz
regularity from $t=0$, and similarly we prove global H\""older estimates under

for solving symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) linear systems. On input of a

algorithm computes a vector $\tilde{x}$ such that $\norm[A]{\tilde{x} - A^+b}
\leq \vareps \cdot \norm[A]{A^+b}$ in $O(m\log^{O(1)}{n}\log{\frac1\epsilon})$
work and $O(m^{1/3+\theta}\log \frac1\epsilon)$ depth for any fixed $\theta >
0$.
  The algorithm relies on a parallel algorithm for generating low-stretch
spanning trees or spanning subgraphs. To this end, we first develop a parallel
decomposition algorithm that in polylogarithmic depth and $\otilde(|E|)$ work,
partitions a graph into components with polylogarithmic diameter such that only
a small fraction of the original edges are between the components. This can be
used to generate low-stretch spanning trees with average stretch
$O(n^{\alpha})$ in $O(n^{1+\alpha})$ work and $O(n^{\alpha})$ depth.
Alternatively, it can be used to generate spanning subgraphs with
polylogarithmic average stretch in $\otilde(|E|)$ work and polylogarithmic
depth. We apply this subgraph construction to derive a parallel linear system
solver. By using this solver in known applications, our results imply improved
parallel randomized algorithms for several problems, including single-source
shortest paths, maximum flow, minimum-cost flow, and approximate maximum flow.

Therefore, defined subsystem wave functions are used to obtain density

reduction in continuum opacity that occurs when individual clumps in a
stochastic medium become optically thick. We consider geometries resulting in
either isotropic or anisotropic effective opacity, and, in addition to an
idealised model in which all clumps have the same local overdensity and scale,
we also treat an ensemble of clumps with optical depths set by Markovian
statistics. This formalism is then applied to the specific case of bound-free
absorption of X-rays in hot star winds, a process not directly affected by
clumping in the optically thin limit. We find that the Markov model gives
surprisingly similar results to those found previously for the single clump
model, suggesting that porous opacity is not very sensitive to details of the
assumed clump distribution function. Further, an anisotropic effective opacity
favours escape of X-rays emitted in the tangential direction (the `venetian
blind' effect), resulting in a 'bump' of higher flux close to line centre as
compared to profiles computed from isotropic porosity models. We demonstrate
how this characteristic line shape may be used to diagnose the clump geometry,
and we confirm previous results that for optically thick clumping to
significantly influence X-ray line profiles, very large porosity lengths,
defined as the mean free path between clumps, are required. Moreover, we
present the first X-ray line profiles computed directly from line-driven
instability simulations using a 3-D patch method, and find that porosity
effects from such models also are very small. This further supports the view
that porosity has, at most, a marginal effect on X-ray line diagnostics in O
stars, and therefore that these diagnostics do indeed provide a good `clumping
insensitive' method for deriving O star mass-loss rates.

treatment of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the astrophysical community. This
discussion relies largely on how the KHI test is posed and analyzed. We pose a
stringent test of the initial growth of the instability. The goal is to provide
a rigorous methodology for verifying a code on two dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. We ran the problem in the Pencil Code, Athena, Enzo, NDSPHMHD, and
Phurbas. A strict comparison, judgment, or ranking, between codes is beyond the
scope of this work, though this work provides the mathematical framework needed
for such a study. Nonetheless, how the test is posed circumvents the issues
raised by tests starting from a sharp contact discontinuity yet it still shows
the poor performance of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We then comment on the
connection between this behavior to the underlying lack of zeroth-order
consistency in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics interpolation. We comment on the
tendency of some methods, particularly those with very low numerical diffusion,
to produce secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz billows on similar tests. Though the lack
of a fixed, physical diffusive scale in the Euler equations lies at the root of
the issue, we suggest that in some methods an extra diffusion operator should
be used to damp the growth of instabilities arising from grid noise. This
statement applies particularly to moving-mesh tessellation codes, but also to
fixed-grid Godunov schemes.

given in \cite{lin1} to a system with coupled gravitational and matter fields.
The matter sector consists of a scalar field $phi$ serving as a cosmological
clock, and other fields ${psi}$ providing physical spatial coordinates and
frames. The physical Hilbert space of the model is constructed from the
kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity, and the local observables in
the physical Hilbert space are constructed using the matter coordinates and
frames. A specific coherent physical state is then chosen, whose expectation
values of the local observables give rise to homogeneous, isotropic and
spatially flat gravitational and $phi$ fields at a late clock time. The
equations governing these fields may be derived using the symmetry of the
physical Hilbert space. When the matter back reactions from ${psi}$ are
negligible, the result gives a specific loop quantum cosmological model in the
$O(hbar^0)$ approximation, with calculable higher order corrections.

polydispersity in self-assembly, we put forward a coarse-grained model that
describes the spontaneous formation of quasi-linear polymers in solutions
containing two self-assembling species. Our theoretical framework is based on a
two-component self-assembled Ising model in which the bidispersity is
parameterized in terms of the strengths of the binding free energies that
depend on the monomer species involved in the pairing interaction. Depending
upon the relative values of the binding free energies involved, different
morphologies of assemblies that include both components are formed, exhibiting
paramagnetic-, ferromagnetic- or anti ferromagnetic-like order, i.e., random,
blocky or alternating ordering of the two components in the assemblies.
Analyzing the model for the case of ferromagnetic ordering, which is of most
practical interest, we find that the transition from conditions of minimal
assembly to those characterized by strong polymerization can be described by a
critical concentration that depends on the concentration ratio of the two
species. Interestingly, the distribution of monomers in the assemblies is
different from that in the original distribution, i.e., the ratio of the
concentrations of the two components put into the system. The monomers with a
smaller binding free energy are more abundant in short assemblies and monomers
with a larger binding affinity are more abundant in longer assemblies. Under
certain conditions the two components congregate into separate supramolecular
polymeric species and in that sense phase separate. We find strong deviations
from the expected growth law for supramolecular polymers even for modest
amounts of a second component, provided it is chemically sufficiently distinct
from the main one.

The cluster state is a useful resource, because once it has been generated only
local operations and measurements are needed to perform universal quantum
computation. In this paper, we explore techniques for quickly and
deterministically building a cluster state. In particular we consider
generating cluster states on a qubus quantum computer, a computational
architecture which uses a continuous variable ancilla to generate interactions
between qubits. We explore several techniques for building the cluster, with
the number of operations required depending on whether we allow the ability to
destroy previously created controlled-phase links between qubits. In the case
where we can not destroy these links, we show how to create an n x m cluster
using just 3nm -2n -3m/2 + 3 operations. This gives more than a factor of 2
saving over a naive method. Further savings can be obtained if we include the
ability to destroy links, in which case we only need (8nm-4n-4m-8)/3
operations. Unfortunately the latter scheme is more complicated so choosing the
correct order to interact the qubits is considerably more difficult. A half way
scheme, that keeps a modular generation but saves additional operations over
never destroying links requires only 3nm-2n-2m+4 operations. The first scheme
and the last scheme are the most practical for building a cluster state because
they split up the generation into the repetition of simple sections.

high-mass passively-evolving bulge-dominated galaxies. Our analysis suggests
that it is likely that a local PSG will quickly transform into ""red"", low-mass

resemble that of the early-type galaxies within the same mass range. We propose
that the current population of PSGs represents a population of galaxies which

reduction, with well-documented merits in various applications involving
high-dimensional data, including computer vision, preference measurement, and
bioinformatics. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates
benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify PCA
against outliers. A least-trimmed squares estimator of a low-rank bilinear
factor analysis model is shown closely related to that obtained from an
$\ell_0$-(pseudo)norm-regularized criterion encouraging sparsity in a matrix
explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests robust PCA schemes
based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a family of robust
estimators encompassing Huber's optimal M-class as a special case. Outliers are
identified by tuning a regularization parameter, which amounts to controlling
sparsity of the outlier matrix along the whole robustification path of (group)
least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) solutions. Beyond its
neat ties to robust statistics, the developed outlier-aware PCA framework is
versatile to accommodate novel and scalable algorithms to: i) track the
low-rank signal subspace robustly, as new data are acquired in real time; and
ii) determine principal components robustly in (possibly) infinite-dimensional
feature spaces. Synthetic and real data tests corroborate the effectiveness of
the proposed robust PCA schemes, when used to identify aberrant responses in

consider a new $Z_2$-parity under which one right-handed neutrino is assigned

neutrino is large, radiative corrections will drive the mass squared of the
corresponding right-handed sneutrino to negative values, breaking the $B-L$
gauge symmetry at the TeV scale in a natural way. Additionally, R-parity is
broken and thus the conventional supersymmetric dark matter candidate, the
neutralino, is no longer viable. Thanks to the $Z_2$-parity, the $Z_2$-odd
right-handed neutrino remains a stable dark matter candidate even in the
presence of R-parity violation. We demonstrate that the dark matter relic
abundance with an enhanced annihilation cross section by the $B-L$ gauge boson
(Z') resonance is in accord with the current observations. Therefore, it
follows that the mass of this dark matter particle is close to half of the Z'
boson mass. If the Z' boson is discovered at the Large Hadron Collider, it will
give rise to novel probes of dark matter: The observed Z' boson mass will
delineate a narrow range of allowed dark matter mass. If the Z' boson decays to
a pair of dark matter particles, a precise measurement of the invisible decay
width can reveal the existence of the dark matter particle.

Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) observed this confined flare in
the X-ray bands and ultraviolet (UV) 1600 \AA \ bands, respectively. In this
event magnetic reconnection occurred at several locations. It first started at
the location of the pre-eruptive flux rope. Then, the observations indicate
that magnetic reconnection occurred between the pre-eruptive magnetic flux rope
and the sheared magnetic arcades more than 10 minutes before the flare peak. It
implied the formation of the larger flux rope, as observed with TRACE. Next,
hard X-ray (HXR) sources appeared at the footpoints of this larger flux rope at
the peak of the flare. The associated high-energy particles may have been
accelerated below the flux rope, in or around a reconnection region. Still, the
close spatial association between the HXR sources and the flux rope footpoints
favors an acceleration within the flux rope. Finally, a topological analysis of
a large solar region including the active regions NOAA 10766 and 10767 shows
the existence of large-scale Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs) before the eruption
of the flux rope. No enhanced emission was found at these QSLs during the
flare, but the UV flare ribbons stopped at the border of the closest
large-scale QSL.

from all model sets suggested that the IRAC band P-L relations may not be
independent of metallicity, as the P-L slopes and intercepts could be affected
by the metallicity and/or helium abundance. We also derive the synthetic period
color(P-C) relations in the IRAC bands. Non-vanishing synthetic P-C relations
were found for certain combinations of IRAC band filters and metallicity.

characterize extrasolar planets surrounding these stars. We detected and
characterized four highly energetic optical flares having U-band total energies
of ~7.8x10^30 to ~1.3x10^32 ergs, and found no corresponding response in the J,
H, or Ks bandpasses at the precision of our data. For active dM3e stars, we

<7.8 (J), <8.8 (H), and <5.1 (Ks) milli-mags of a response. A flare of this

stellar variability not associated with discrete flare events was observed at
the level of ~3.9 milli-mags over 1 hour time-scales and at the level of ~5.6

dwarf stellar activity and flares will not influence IR detection and
characterization studies of M dwarf exoplanets above the level of ~5-11
milli-mags, depending on the filter and spectral type. We speculate that the
most energetic megaflares on M dwarfs, which occur at rates of once per month,
are likely to be easily detected in IR observations with sensitivity of tens of

algorithms, given by W. R. Thompson, dates back to 1933. This algorithm,
referred to as Thompson Sampling, is a natural Bayesian algorithm. The basic
idea is to choose an arm to play according to its probability of being the best
arm. Thompson Sampling algorithm has experimentally been shown to be close to
optimal. In addition, it is efficient to implement and exhibits several
desirable properties such as small regret for delayed feedback. However,
theoretical understanding of this algorithm was quite limited. In this paper,
for the first time, we show that Thompson Sampling algorithm achieves
logarithmic expected regret for the multi-armed bandit problem. More precisely,
for the two-armed bandit problem, the expected regret in time $T$ is
$O(\frac{\ln T}{\Delta} + \frac{1}{\Delta^3})$. And, for the $N$-armed bandit
problem, the expected regret in time $T$ is $O([(\sum_{i=2}^N

with half of them Be-type transients, are known to exhibit Cyclotron Resonance
Scattering Features (CRSFs) in their X-ray spectra, with characteristic line
energies from 10 to 60 keV. To date about two thirds of them, plus a few
similar systems without known CRSFs, have been observed with Suzaku. We present
an overview of results from these observations, including the discovery of a
CRSF in the transient 1A 1118-61 and pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of GX
301-2. These observations allow for the determination of cyclotron line
parameters to an unprecedented degree of accuracy within a moderate amount of
observing time. This is important since these parameters vary - e.g., with
orbital phase, pulse phase, or luminosity - depending on the geometry of the
magnetic field of the pulsar and the properties of the accretion column at the
magnetic poles. We briefly introduce a spectral model for CRSFs that is
currently being developed and that for the first time is based on these
physical properties. In addition to cyclotron line measurements, selected
highlights from the Suzaku analyses include dip and flare studies, e.g., of 4U
1907+09 and Vela X-1, which show clumpy wind effects (like partial absorption
and/or a decrease in the mass accretion rate supplied by the wind) and may also
display magnetospheric gating effects.

young stellar object, MWC325, taken with the 85 m baseline Keck Interferometer.
The Keck nuller was designed for the study of faint dust signatures associated
with debris disks, but it also has a unique capability for studying the
temperature and density distribution of denser disks found around young stellar
objects. Interferometric observations of MWC 325 at K, L and N encompass a
factor of five in spectral range and thus, especially when spectrally dispersed
within each band, enable characterization of the structure of the inner disk
regions where planets form. Fitting our observations with geometric models such
as a uniform disk or a Gaussian disk show that the apparent size increases
monotonically with wavelength in the 2-12 um wavelength region, confirming the
widely held assumption based on radiative transfer models, now with spatially
resolved measurements over broad wavelength range, that disks are extended with
a temperature gradient. The effective size is a factor of about 1.3 and 2
larger in the L-band and N-band, respectively, compared to that in the K-band.
The existing interferometric measurements and the spectral energy distribution
can be reproduced by a flat disk or a weakly-shadowed nearly flat-disk model,
with only slight flaring in the outer regions of the disk, consisting of
representative ""sub-micron"" (0.1 um) and ""micron"" (2 um) grains of a 50:50
ratio of silicate and graphite. This is marked contrast with the disks
previously found in other Herbig Ae/Be stars suggesting a wide variety in the

by the first author in the case of a binary alphabet $A$, and later extended by
other authors to arbitrary alphabets. Acting on infinite words, $\psi$
generates the class of standard episturmian words, including standard
Arnoux-Rauzy words. In this paper we generalize the palindromization map,
starting with a given code $X$ over $A$. The new map $\psi_X$ maps $X^*$ to the
set $PAL$ of palindromes of $A^*$. In this way some properties of $\psi$ are
lost and some are saved in a weak form. When $X$ has a finite deciphering delay
one can extend $\psi_X$ to $X^{\omega}$, generating a class of infinite words
much wider than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code $X$
over $A$, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words,
called $X$-AR words. We prove that any $X$-AR word is a morphic image of a
standard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and
upper bounds to its factor complexity.
  For any code $X$ we say that $\psi_X$ is conservative when
$\psi_X(X^{*})\subseteq X^{*}$. We study conservative maps $\psi_X$ and
conditions on $X$ assuring that $\psi_X$ is conservative. We also investigate
the special case of morphic-conservative maps $\psi_{X}$, i.e., maps such that
$\phi\circ \psi = \psi_X\circ \phi$ for an injective morphism $\phi$. Finally,
we generalize $\psi_X$ by replacing palindromic closure with
$\theta$-palindromic closure, where $\theta$ is any involutory antimorphism of
$A^*$. This yields an extension of the class of $\theta$-standard words
introduced by the authors in 2006.

statistical asymptotic theory can not be applied to such learning machines

algebraic geometry and it was clarified that the generalization and training
errors are determined by two birational invariants, the real log canonical
threshold and the singular fluctuation. However, their concrete values are left
unknown. In the present paper, we propose a new concept, a quasi-regular case
in statistical learning theory. A quasi-regular case is not a regular case but
a singular case, however, it has the same property as a regular case. In fact,
we prove that, in a quasi-regular case, two birational invariants are equal to
each other, resulting that the symmetry of the generalization and training
errors holds. Moreover, the concrete values of two birational invariants are
explicitly obtained, the quasi-regular case is useful to study statistical

possible explanations are that (i) the host galaxy is simply not detected
within the sensitivity of the available data or that (ii) the progenitor is a
hypervelocity star that has escaped its parent galaxy. We use the Type IIb SN
2009Z as a prototype of case (i), an example of how a very faint (here Low
Surface Brightness; LSB) galaxy can be discovered via the observation of a
seemingly host-less SN. By identifying and studying LSB galaxies that host SNe
related to the death of massive stars, we can place constraints on the stellar
population and environment of LSB galaxies, which at present are poorly
understood. From an HI spectrum, a redshift of z = 0.02513+-0.00001 and an HI
mass of (2.96+-0.12) 10^9 M_sun are computed. This redshift is consistent with
that obtained from optical emission lines of SN 2009Z. Furthermore, a gas mass
fraction of f_g = 0.87+-0.04 is obtained, one of the highest fractions ever
measured. The host galaxy shows signs of recently enhanced star formation
activity with a far-UV derived extinction-corrected Star Formation Rate (SFR)
of 0.44+-0.34 M_sun/yr. Based on the B-band luminosity we estimate an
extinction-corrected metallicity following the calibration by Pilyugin (2001)
of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.24+-0.70. The presence of a Type IIb SN in an LSB galaxy
suggests, contrary to popular belief, that massive stars can be formed in this
type of galaxies. Furthermore, our results imply that LSB galaxies undergo
phases of small, local burst activity intermittent with longer phases of
inactivity.

the point that, while the usual sources of irregularities of solar cycles may
be sufficient to cause a grand minimum, the solar dynamo has to operate
somewhat differently from the normal to bring the Sun out of the grand minimum.
We then consider three possible sources of irregularities in the solar dynamo:
(i) nonlinear effects; (ii) fluctuations in the poloidal field generation
process; (iii) fluctuations in the meridional circulation. We conclude that (i)
is unlikely to be the cause behind grand minima, but a combination of (ii) and
(iii) may cause them. If fluctuations make the poloidal field fall much below
the average or make the meridional circulation significantly weaker, then the
Sun may be pushed into a grand minimum.

these are commonly unable to fully reconcile theoretical predictions with
observations. In contrast, the recently revised two level system (TLS) model
seems to provide a promising way of interpreting the existing data. The newly
available Herschel Hi-GAL data which covers most of the inner Milky-Way offers
a unique opportunity to investigate possible variations in the dust emission
properties both with wavelength and environment. By combining the IRIS 100
{\mu}m with the Hi-GAL 160, 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m data, we model the dust
emission spectra in each pixel of the Hi-GAL maps, using both the TLS model
and, for comparison, a single modified black-body fit. The effect of
temperature mixing along the line of sight is investigated. We find a slight
decrease in the dust temperature with distance from the Galactic center. We
also report the detection of a significant 500 {\mu}m emissivity excess in the
peripheral regions of the plane (35\circ<|l|<70\circ) of about 13-15% of the
emissivity, that can reach up to 20% in some HII regions. We present the

numerically the excitation of a traveling breather after an impact at one end

local oscillations are faster than binary collisions, a situation occuring e.g.

in planetary systems. We present an analytical model to describe this process
using the simplifying assumption that each particle's dynamics is dominated by
a single planet at a time. As such the scattering process can be considered as
a series of three body problems during each of which the Tisserand parameter
with respect to the relevant planet is conserved. This constrains the orbital
parameter space into which a particle can be scattered. Such arguments have
previously been applied to the process by which comets are scattered to the
inner Solar System from the Kuiper belt. Our analysis generalises this for an
arbitrary planetary system. For particles scattered from an outer belt directly
along a chain of planets, based on the initial value of the Tisserand
parameter, we find that it is possible to (i) determine which planets can eject
the particles from the system, (ii) define a minimum stellar distance to which
particles can be scattered, and (iii) constrain range of particle inclinations
(and hence the disc height) at different distances. Applying this to the Solar
System, we determine that the planets are close to optimally separated for
scattering particles between them. Concerning warm dust found around stars that
also have Kuiper belt analogues, we show that, if there is to be a dynamical
link between the outer and inner regions, then certain architectures for the
intervening planetary system are incapable of producing the observations.
Furthermore we show that for certain planetary systems, comets can be scattered
from an outer belt, or with fewer constraints, from an Oort cloud analogue,
onto star-grazing orbits, in support of a planetary origin to the metal
pollution and dustiness of some nearby white dwarfs.

enrichment of the cold gas phase, which is the material that forms molecular
clouds. Following previous work, the expansion and collision of two supershells
in a diffuse ISM is simulated, in this case also introducing an advected
quantity which represents the metals expelled by the young stars. We adopt the
simplest possible approach, not differentiating between metals coming from
stellar winds and those coming from supernovae. Even though the hot, diffuse
phase of the ISM receives a significant amount of metals from the stars, the
cold phase is efficiently shielded, with very little metal enrichment.
Significant enrichment of the cold ISM will therefore be delayed by at least
the cooling time of this hot phase. No variations in cloud metallicity with
distance from the OB association or with direction are found, which means that
the shell collision does little to enhance the metallicity of the cold clumps.
We conclude that the stellar generation that forms out of molecular structures,
triggered by shell collisions cannot be significantly enriched.

due to the proximity effect within a phase separation scenario. We use a
two-orbital model to study the proximity effect on a layer of block AFM state
induced by neighboring SC layers via an interlayer tunneling mechanism. We
argue that the proximity effect in ternary Fe-selenides should be large because
of the large interlayer coupling and weak electron correlation. The result of
our mean field theory is compared with the neutron experiments

sit in an interstitial site and a very weak relaxation of the lattice positions
away from the vortex core position has been observed. Also other properties
like Bragg peaks in the static structure factor or the behavior of vacancies
are very little affected by the presence of the vortex. We have computed also
the one-body density matrix in perfect and defected 4He crystals finding that
the vortex has no sensible effect on the off-diagonal long range tail of the

measurements that are inconsistent with any locally causal theory, as
demonstrated by the violation of a Bell inequality. Typical demonstrations of
these correlations require careful alignment between the measurements, which
requires distant parties to share a reference frame. Here, we prove, following
a numerical observation by Shadbolt et al., that if two parties share a Bell
state and each party randomly chooses three orthogonal measurements, then the
parties will always violate a Bell inequality. Furthermore, we prove that this
probability is highly robust against local depolarizing noise, in that small
levels of noise only decrease the probability of violating a Bell inequality by
a small amount. We also show that generalizing to N parties increases the
robustness against noise. These results improve on previous ones that only
allowed a high probability of violating a Bell inequality for large numbers of
parties.

(MANET) where agents travel through the network, collecting and sometimes
spreading the dynamically changing service information. But it is important to
investigate how reliable the agents are for this application as the
dependability issues(reliability and availability) of MANET are highly affected
by its dynamic nature.The complexity of underlying MANET makes it hard to
obtain the route reliability of the mobile agent systems (MAS); instead we
estimate it using Monte Carlo simulation. Thus an algorithm for estimating the
task route reliability of MAS (deployed for discovering services) is proposed,
that takes into account the effect of node mobility in MANET. That mobility
pattern of the nodes affects the MAS performance is also shown by considering
different mobility models. Multipath propagation effect of radio signal is
considered to decide link existence. Transient link errors are also considered.
Finally we propose a metric to calculate the reliability of service discovery
protocol and see how MAS performance affects the protocol reliability. The
experimental results show the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Here the
optimum value of network bandwidth (needed to support the agents) is calculated
for our application. However the reliability of MAS is highly dependent on link
failure probability.

initially prepared in different pure separable and maximally entangled states

sequences are found to enable one to obtain constant long-lasting entanglement
with desired magnitude. Moreover, the time ordering effects are found to be

Further, we analyze the angular distributions and rainbows in proton channeling

point of our approach is that the presence of detector's threshold and
calibration procedure have to be treated not as simply experimental
technicalities, but as the basic counteparts of the theoretical model. The
presence of the background field (vacuum fluctuations) is also the key-element
of our prequantum model. It is of the classical signal type and the methods of
classical signal theory (including statistical radiophysics) are used for its
development. We stress that our prequantum model is not objective, i.e., the
values of observables (clicks of detectors) cannot be assigned in advance,
i.e., before measurement. Hence, the dilemma, nonobjectivity or nonlocality, is
resolved in favor of nonobjectivity (our model is local of the classical field
type). In particular, we reproduce the probabilities for the EPR-experiment for
photon polarization and, hence, violate CHSH inequality for classical random
signals (measured by the threshold type and properly calibrated detectors
acting in the presence of the background field).

Schur. It differs from the normal representation of groups by a twisting
factor. It starts with a group T and a scalar valued function f on T^2
satisfying the conditions: f(1,1)=1, |f(s,t)|=1, and
f(r,s)f(rs,t)=f(r,st)f(s,t) for all r,s,t in T. The projective representation
of T twisted by f is a unital C*-subalgebra of the C*-algebra of operators on
the Hilbert space l^2(T). This representation can be used in order to construct
many examples of C*-algebras. By replacing the scalars with an arbitrary unital
C*-algebra (as range of f) the field of applications is enhanced in an
essential way. The projective representation of groups, which we present in
this paper, has some similarities with the construction of cross products with
discrete groups. It opens the way to create many K-theories.

construction, which is developed in the second section. In a third section we
present some examples of C*-algebras obtained by this method. Examples of a

properties of subhaloes vary as a function of the parent halo mass, the
physical properties of the parent halo, and redshift. The fraction of halo mass
in substructures increases with increasing mass. There is, however, a very
large halo-to-halo scatter that can be explained only in part by a range of
halo physical properties, e.g. concentration. At given halo mass, less
concentrated haloes contain significantly larger fractions of mass in
substructures because of the reduced strength of tidal disruption. Most of the
substructure mass is located at the outskirts of the parent haloes, in
relatively few massive subhaloes. This mass segregation appears to become
stronger at increasing redshift, and should reflect into a more significant
mass segregation of the galaxy population at different cosmic epochs. When
haloes are accreted onto larger structures, their mass is significantly reduced
by tidal stripping. Haloes that are more massive at the time of accretion
(these should host more luminous galaxies) are brought closer to the centre on
shorter time-scales by dynamical friction, and therefore suffer of a more
significant stripping. The halo merger rate depends strongly on the environment
with substructure in more massive haloes suffering more important mergers than
their counterparts residing in less massive systems. This should translate into
a different morphological mix for haloes of different mass.

matter against isoscalar density oscillations, a feature which is absent in
calculations employing low-momentum two-nucleon interactions only. We find a
rather large uncertainty for the nuclear compression modulus due to a sensitive
dependence on the low-energy constant c_3. The effective nucleon mass on the

significantly smaller than its value extracted from experimental data, whereas

unity. The above findings are applied to a model of hybrid inflation is
supergravity with a generic Kaehler potential. The spectral index of the
generated curvature perturbations is found to be 0.97 - 0.98, in excellent
agreement with observations. The gauge field can play the role of the vector
curvaton after inflation but observable statistical anisotropy requires
substantial tuning of the gauge coupling.

Intrusion detection system is one of the major and efficient defensive methods
against attacks in HWSNET. Because of different constraints of sensor networks,
security solutions have to be designed with limited usage of computation and
resources. A particularly devastating attack is the sleep deprivation attack.
Here a malicious node forces legitimate nodes to waste their energy by
resisting the sensor nodes from going into low power sleep mode. The target of
this attack is to maximize the power consumption of the affected node, thereby
decreasing its battery life. Existing works on sleep deprivation attack have
mainly focused on mitigation using MAC based protocols, such as S-MAC (sensor
MAC), T-MAC (timeout MAC), B-MAC (Berkley MAC), G-MAC (gateway MAC). In this
article, a brief review of some of the recent intrusion detection systems in

for heterogeneous wireless sensor network (HWSNET) to efficiently detect sleep

investigated. The mechanisms of angular momentum transport and energy
dissipation are assumed to be the viscosity due to turbulence in the accretion
disc. The energy equation is considered in situation that the released energy
by viscosity dissipation is balanced with cooling processes. The viscosity is
obtained by equality of dissipation and cooling functions, and is used for
angular momentum equation. The cooling rate of the flow is calculated by a
prescription, $d u/d t=-u/\tau_{cool}$, that $u$ and $\tau_{cool}$ are internal
energy and cooling timescale, respectively. The ratio of local cooling to
dynamical timescales $\Omega \tau_{cool}$ is assumed as a constant and also as
a function of local temperature. The solutions for protoplanetary discs show
that in situation of $\Omega \tau_{cool} = constant$, the disc does not show
any gravitational instability in small radii for a typically mass accretion
rate, $\dot{M} = 10^{-6} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, while by choosing $\Omega
\tau_{cool}$ as a function of temperature, the gravitational instability for
this amount of mass accretion rate or even less can occur in small radii. Also,
by study of the viscous parameter $\alpha$, we find that the strength of
turbulence in the inner part of self-gravitating protoplanetary discs is very
low. These results are qualitatively consistent with direct numerical
simulations of protoplanetary discs.

poorly constrained. Here I use archived near-infrared photometry from 2MASS,
UKIDSS, and DENIS to investigate the long-term variability of high-confidence
members of the four star forming regions Rho-Oph, ONC, IC348, and NGC1333. The
total sample comprises more than 600 objects, from which ~320 are considered to
have a disk. The dataset covers timescales up to 8 yr. About half of the YSOs
are variable on a 2sigma level, with median amplitudes of 5-20%. The fraction
of highly variable objects with amplitudes >0.5 mag in at least two
near-infrared bands is very low - 2% for the entire sample and 3% for objects
with disks. These sources with strong variability are mostly objects with disks
and are prime targets for follow-up studies. The variability amplitudes are
largest in NGC1333, presumably because it is the youngest sample of YSOs. The
frequency of highly variable objects also increases with the time window of the
observations (from weeks to years). These results have three implications: 1)
When deriving luminosities for YSOs from near-infrared magnitudes, the typical
error introduced by variability is in the range of 5-20% percent and depends on
disk fraction and possibly age. 2) Variability is a negligible contribution to
the scatter in HR diagrams of star forming regions (except for a small number
of extreme objects), if luminosities are derived from near-infrared magnitudes.
3) Accretion outbursts with an increase in mass accretion rate by several order
of magnitudes, as required in scenarios for episodic accretion, occur with a
duty cycle of >2000-2500 yr in the Class II phase. (abridged)

unclear in the current literature how an existing ontology building methodology
can be applied to develop semantic ontology models in a government service
domain. In this paper the Uschold and King ontology building methodology is
applied to develop semantic ontology models in a government service domain.
Firstly, the Uschold and King methodology is presented, discussed and applied
to build a government domain ontology. Secondly, the domain ontology is
evaluated for semantic consistency using its semi-formal representation in
Description Logic. Thirdly, an alignment of the domain ontology with the
Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) upper
level ontology is drawn to allow its wider visibility and facilitate its
integration with existing metadata standard. Finally, the domain ontology is
formally written in Web Ontology Language (OWL) to enable its automatic
processing by computers. The study aims to provide direction for the
application of existing ontology building methodologies in the Semantic Web
development processes of e-government domain specific ontology models; which
would enable their repeatability in other e-government projects and strengthen
the adoption of semantic technologies in e-government.

  and Relaxation Tasks: Design and Evaluation","International Conference of the IEEE EMBS (2011)",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we explore the use of electrical biosignals measured on scalp
and corresponding to mental relaxation and concentration tasks in order to
control an object in a video game. To evaluate the requirements of such a
system in terms of sensors and signal processing we compare two designs. The
first one uses only one scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) electrode and the
power in the alpha frequency band. The second one uses sixteen scalp EEG
electrodes and machine learning methods. The role of muscular activity is also
evaluated using five electrodes positioned on the face and the neck. Results
show that the first design enabled 70% of the participants to successfully
control the game, whereas 100% of the participants managed to do it with the
second design based on machine learning. Subjective questionnaires confirm
these results: users globally felt to have control in both designs, with an
increased feeling of control in the second one. Offline analysis of face and
neck muscle activity shows that this activity could also be used to distinguish
between relaxation and concentration tasks. Results suggest that the
combination of muscular and brain activity could improve performance of this
kind of system. They also suggest that muscular activity has probably been
recorded by EEG electrodes.
