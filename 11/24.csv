the behavior of individuals, groups and societies. Here, we observe the
formation and evolution of networks by monitoring the addition of all new links
and we analyze quantitatively the tendencies used to create ties in these
evolving online affiliation networks. We first show that an accurate estimation
of these probabilistic tendencies can only be achieved by following the time
evolution of the network. For example, actions that are attributed to the usual
friend of a friend mechanism through a static snapshot of the network are
overestimated by a factor of two. A detailed analysis of the dynamic network
evolution shows that half of those triangles were generated through other
mechanisms, in spite of the characteristic static pattern. We start by
characterizing every single link when the tie was established in the network.
This allows us to describe the probabilistic tendencies of tie formation and
extract sociological conclusions as follows. The tendencies to add new links
differ significantly from what we would expect if they were not affected by the
individuals' structural position in the network, i.e., from random link
formation. We also find significant differences in behavioral traits among
individuals according to their degree of activity, gender, age, popularity and
other attributes. For instance, in the particular datasets analyzed here, we
find that women reciprocate connections three times as much as men and this
difference increases with age. Men tend to connect with the most popular people
more often than women across all ages. On the other hand, triangular ties
tendencies are similar and independent of gender. Our findings can be useful to
build models of realistic social network structures and discover the underlying
laws that govern establishment of ties in evolving social networks.

colloidal systems is that a grand-canonical free energy functional may be
employed to generate the thermodynamic driving forces. Using one-dimensional
hard-rods as a model system we analyze the validity of this key assumption and
show that unphysical self-interactions of the tagged particle density fields,
arising from coupling to a particle reservoir, are responsible for the
excessively fast relaxation predicted by the theory. Moreover, our findings
suggest that even employing a canonical functional would not lead to an
improvement for many-particle systems, if only the total density is considered.
We present several possible schemes to suppress these effects by incorporating
tagged densities. When applied to confined systems we demonstrate, using a
simple example, that DDFT neccessarily leads to delocalized tagged particle
density distributions, which do not respect the fundamental geometrical
contraints apparent in Brownian dynamics simulation data. The implication of
these results for possible applications of DDFT to treat the glass transition
are discussed.

magnetic fields in the envelope are caused by field reversals when turbulence
twists the field lines such that field components in different directions
average out. Finally, we propose two mechanisms for generating values |R| ~< 1
for the weak and strong magnetic field limit in the context of a turbulent
model. First, in the weak field limit, the small-scale turbulent dynamo leads
to a significantly increased flux in the core and we find |R| ~< 1. Second, in
the strong field limit, field reversals in the envelope also lead to values |R|
~< 1. These reversals are less likely to occur in the core region where the
velocity field is more coherent and the internal velocity dispersion is
typically subsonic.

hierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks that
contribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (CRs). Hence,
clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act as
energy reservoirs for additional CR sources, such as active galactic nuclei and
supernova-driven galactic winds. To detect the gamma-ray emission from CR
interactions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to date
observational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energy
gamma-rays and observed the Perseus cluster with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes
for a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. This campaign resulted in
the detection of the central radio galaxy NGC 1275 at energies E > 100 GeV with
a very steep energy spectrum. Here, we restrict our analysis to energies E >
630 GeV and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. This constrains the average
CR-to-thermal pressure ratio to be <= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and the
model for CR emission. Comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictions
from cosmological cluster simulations that include CRs constrains the maximum
CR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be < 50%.
Alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible CR transport processes such as
CR streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. Finally, we derive
lower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the Perseus radio
mini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created in
hadronic CR interactions: assuming a spectrum of E^-2.2 around TeV energies as
implied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be > 4-9
microG, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength toward
larger radii.

the field of view, resulting in directionally-dependent (DD), time-varying
gains. The primary beam will deviate from the theoretical estimate in real
cases at levels that will limit the dynamic range of images if left
uncorrected. Ionospheric electron density variations cause time and position
variable refraction of sources. At low frequencies and sufficiently high
dynamic range this will also defocus the images producing error patterns that
vary with position and also with frequency due to the chromatic aberration of
synthesis telescopes. Superposition of such residual sidelobes can lead to
spurious spectral signals. Field-based ionospheric calibration as well as
""peeling"" calibration of strong sources leads to images with higher dynamic
range and lower spurious signals but will be limited by sensitivity on the

as quantum field theories they must admit a different notion of causality than
standard local Lorentz invariant theories. We show that in these theories it is
easy to construct closed timelike curves (CTCs) within the {\it naive} regime
of validity of the effective field theory. However, on closer inspection we see
that the CTCs could never arise since the Galileon inevitably becomes
infinitely strongly coupled at the onset of the formation of a CTC. This
implies an infinite amount of backreaction, first on the background for the
Galileon field, signaling the break down of the effective field theory, and
subsequently on the spacetime geometry, forbidding the formation of the CTC.
Furthermore the background solution required to create CTCs becomes unstable
with an arbitrarily fast decay time. Thus Galileon theories satisfy a direct
analogue of Hawking's chronology protection conjecture.

anticipate that statistics on the kappa-Minkowski is specifically

between standard quantum field theory (QFT) and NCQFT on the kappa-deformed
Minkowski spacetime, resulting in a kappa-effective model. The propagation is
analyzed in the framework of the two-point Green's function for low,
intermediate, and for the Planckian propagation energies, respectively.
Semiclassical/hybrid behavior of the first order quantum correction do show up
due to the kappa-deformed momentum conservation law. For low energies, the
dependence of the tadpole contribution on the deformation parameter a drops out
completely, while for Planckian energies, it tends to a fixed finite value. The
mass term of the scalar field is shifted and these shifts are very different at
different propagation energies. At the Planckian energies we obtain the
direction dependent kappa-modified dispersion relations. Thus our
kappa-effective model for the massive scalar field shows a birefringence

multiple related health outcomes and high-dimensional predictors. For example,
in reproductive epidemiology, one may collect pregnancy outcomes such as length
of gestation and birth weight and predictors such as single nucleotide
polymorphisms in multiple candidate genes and environmental exposures. In such
settings, there is a need for simple yet flexible methods for selecting true
predictors of adverse health responses from a high-dimensional set of candidate
predictors. To address this problem, one may either consider linear regression
models for the continuous outcomes or convert these outcomes into binary
indicators of adverse responses using pre-defined cutoffs. The former strategy
has the disadvantage of often leading to a poorly fitting model that does not
predict risk well, while the latter approach can be very sensitive to the
cutoff choice. As a simple yet flexible alternative, we propose a method for
adverse subpopulation regression (ASPR), which relies on a two component latent
class model, with the dominant component corresponding to (presumed) healthy
individuals and the risk of falling in the minority component characterized via
a logistic regression. The logistic regression model is designed to accommodate
high-dimensional predictors, as occur in studies with a large number of gene by
environment interactions, through use of a flexible nonparametric multiple
shrinkage approach. The Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation.
The methods are evaluated using simulation studies and applied to a genetic
epidemiology study of pregnancy outcomes.

with potential V({\phi}). In order to fix the scalar field potential we demand
Lie symmetry invariance of the field equations, which is a model-independent
assumption. The requirement of an extra Lie symmetry selects the exponential
scalar field potential. The further requirement that the analytic solution is
invariant under the point transformation generated by the Lie symmetry
eliminates dark matter and leads to a quintessence and a phantom cosmological
model containing a perfect fluid and a scalar field. Next we assume that the
Lagrangian of the system admits an extra Noether symmetry. This new assumption
selects the scalar field potential to be exponential and forces the perfect
fluid to be stiff. Furthermore the existence of the Noether integral allows for
the integration of the dynamical equations. We find new analytic solutions to
quintessence and phantom cosmologies which contain all three fluids. Using
these solutions one is able to compute analytically all main cosmological

long read aligner that is both more accurate (i.e., aligns more reads with
fewer errors) and 10-100x faster than state-of-the-art tools such as BWA.
Unlike recent aligners based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform, SNAP uses a
simple hash index of short seed sequences from the genome, similar to BLAST's.
However, SNAP greatly reduces the number and cost of local alignment checks
performed through several measures: it uses longer seeds to reduce the false
positive locations considered, leverages larger memory capacities to speed
index lookup, and excludes most candidate locations without fully computing
their edit distance to the read. The result is an algorithm that scales well
for reads from one hundred to thousands of bases long and provides a rich error
model that can match classes of mutations (e.g., longer indels) that today's
fast aligners ignore. We calculate that SNAP can align a dataset with 30x
coverage of a human genome in less than an hour for a cost of $2 on Amazon EC2,
with higher accuracy than BWA. Finally, we describe ongoing work to further
improve SNAP.

clusters, by comparing X-ray scaling relations to theoretical expectations,
obtained assuming that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the DM and
follows a polytropic relation. We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic
index Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at
large radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the
observed mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are
independent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by
fixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM
profile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical
simulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10
allows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large
radii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma
and the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce
the observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6
K<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot
intergalactic medium. When extrapolated to high redshift z, the model with a
constant Gamma reproduces the expected self-similar behaviour. We also account
for the observed, non-self-similar relations provided by some high-z clusters,
as they provide constraints on the evolution of Gamma. Comparing our model to
the observed luminosity-temperature relation, we discriminate between different
M-c_vir relations: a weak dependence of c_vir on M is currently preferred by
data. This simple theoretical model accounts for much of the complexity of
recent, improved X-ray scaling relations, provided that we allow for a mild
dependence of Gamma on M or for T_xi consistent with intercluster values.

number of issues that arise when regularizing the theory with a momentum-space

to obtain covariant results for the renormalized vacuum energy-momentum tensor.
We clarify some confusion in the literature concerning the equation of state of
vacuum fluctuations. Further, we point out that the general structure of the
effective action becomes richer if the theory contains a scalar field phi with
mass m smaller than the Hubble parameter H(t). Such an ultra-light particle
cannot be integrated out completely to get the effective action. Apart from the
volume term and the Einstein-Hilbert term, that are reabsorbed into
renormalizations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the
effective action in general also has a term proportional to F(phi)R, for some
function F(phi). As a result, vacuum fluctuations of ultra-light scalar fields
naturally lead to models where the dark energy density has the form
rho_{DE}(t)=rho_X(t)+rho_Z(t), where rho_X is the component that accelerates
the Hubble expansion at late times and rho_Z(t) is an extra contribution
proportional to H^2(t). We perform a detailed comparison of such models with
CMB, SNIa and BAO data.

conjectured in many contexts. However, the ""stability of physical theories

deformation theory, an unambiguous derivation of the stable structures that
Nature might have chosen for its algebraic framework. It is well-known that $c$
and $\hbar $ are the deformation parameters that stabilize the Galilean and the
Poisson algebra. When the stability principle is applied to the
Poincar\'{e}-Heisenberg algebra, two deformation parameters emerge which define
two length (or time) scales. In addition there are, for each of them, a plus or
minus sign possibility in the relevant commutators. One of the deformation
length scales, related to non-commutativity of momenta, is probably related to
the Planck length scale but the other might be much larger. In this paper this
is used as a working hypothesis to look for physical effects that might settle
this question. Phase-space modifications, deviations from $c$ in speed
measurements of massless wave packets, resonances, interference, electron spin
resonance and non-commutative QED are considered.

stars have lower proper motions and may be located closer to the galactic
plane. We also investigate the frequency content of the variability, finding

showing that there exist significant differences in the nature of variability
between spectral types. Of the periodic objects, most A and F stars have short
periods (< 2 days) and highly sinusoidal variability, suggestive of pulsations,
whilst G, K and M stars tend to have longer periods (> 5 days, with a trend
towards longer periods at later spectral types) and show a mixture of periodic

  From this assignment secondary structure elements can be detected with an

the protein emphasizes any irregularities in the element.
  It is also possible to use this analysis to detect characteristic

MPa. In addition, we show that a phenomenological extension of the theoretical
model can account for all currently available experimental data in the
supercooled region, up to 400 MPa. The stability limit of the liquid state and
possible coupling between crystallization and liquid-liquid separation are
discussed. It is concluded that critical-point thermodynamics describes the
available thermodynamic data for supercooled water within experimental
accuracy, thus establishing a benchmark for further developments in this area.

results of modeling the atmospheric effects, especially production of odd

previous studies of the atmospheric effect of this event. We investigate
changes in NOy compounds as well as depletion of O3 using a two-dimensional

using a range-energy relation with four different proxy proton spectra
associated with more recent well-known solar proton events. We find that
changes in atmospheric constituents are in reasonable agreement with previous
studies, but effects of the four proxy spectra used vary more widely than found
by one of those studies. In particular, we find greater impact for harder
proton spectra, given a constant total fluence. We report computed nitrate
deposition values and compare to measured values in ice cores. Finally, we
briefly investigate the impact of the modeled ozone depletion on surface-level
solar ultraviolet radiation.

the discovered planets so far are gas giants, precluding their habitability.
However, if these hot Jupiters are located in the habitable zones of their host
stars, and if rocky moons orbit them, then these moons may be habitable. In
this work, we present a model for planetary transit simulation considering the
presence of moons and planetary rings around a planet. The moon's orbit is
considered to be circular and coplanar with the planetary orbit. The other
physical and orbital parameters of the star, planet, moon, and rings can be
adjusted in each simulation. It is possible to simulate as many successive
transits as desired. Since the presence of spots on the surface of the star may
produce a signal similar to that of the presence of a moon, our model also
allows for the inclusion of starspots. The result of the simulation is a light
curve with a planetary transit. White noise may also be added to the light
curves to produce curves similar to those obtained by the CoRoT and Kepler
space telescopes. The goal is to determine the criteria for detectability of
moons and/or ring systems using photometry. The results show that it is
possible to detect moons with radii as little as 1.3 R$_{\oplus}$ with CoRoT

two competing possible paths of planet formation. In recent years, evidence
have accumulated in favor of core accretion as the dominant mode, at least for
close-in planets. However, it might be hypothesized that a significant
population of wide planets formed by disk instabilities could exist at large
separations, forming an invisible majority. In previous work, we addressed this
issue through a direct imaging survey of B2--A0-type stars, and concluded that
<30% of such stars form and retain planets and brown dwarfs through disk
instability, leaving core accretion as the likely dominant mechanism. In this
paper, we extend this analysis to FGKM-type stars by applying a similar
analysis to the Gemini Deep Planet Survey (GDPS) sample. The results strengthen
the conclusion that substellar companions formed and retained around their
parent stars by disk instabilities are rare. Specifically, we find that the
frequency of such companions is <8% for FGKM-type stars under our most
conservative assumptions, for an outer disk radius of 300 AU, at 99%
confidence. Furthermore, we find that the frequency is always <10% at 99%
confidence independently of outer disk radius, for any radius from 5 to 500 AU.
We also simulate migration at a wide range of rates, and find that the
conclusions hold even if the companions move substantially after formation.
Hence, core accretion remains the likely dominant formation mechanism for the
total planet population, for every type of star from M-type through B-type.

radii comparable to the binary/triple separation. Together, these two
characteristics suggest that binaries with intermediate separations of 1-100 AU
readily clear out their disks. We find that the fractional disk luminosity, as
a proxy for disk mass, is generally lower for multiple systems than for single
stars at any given age. Hence, for a binary to possess a disk (or form planets)
it must either be a very widely separated binary with disk particles orbiting a
single star or it must be a small separation binary with a circumbinary disk.

effects of the radiation pressure of massive stars before they explode as
supernovae. The increased stellar feedback results in the expansion of the dark
matter halo instead of contraction with respect to N-body simulations. Baryons
are able to erase the dark matter cuspy distribution creating a flat, cored,
dark matter density profile in the central several kpc of a massive Milky-Way
like halo. The profile is well fit by a Burkert profile, with fitting
parameters consistent with the observations. In addition, we obtain flat
rotation curves as well as extended, exponential stellar disk profiles. While
the stellar disk we obtain is still partially too thick to resemble the MW thin

that is higher than their gravitational attraction, they launch a
radiation-pressure-driven outflow. It has been claimed that a radiative
Rayleigh-Taylor instability should lead to the collapse of the outflow cavity
and foster the growth of massive stars.
  Aims: We investigate the stability of idealized radiation-pressure-dominated
cavities, focusing on its dependence on the radiation transport approach for
the stellar radiation feedback.
  Methods: We compare two different methods for stellar radiation feedback:
gray flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and ray-tracing (RT). We also derive simple
analytical models to support our findings.
  Results: Only the FLD cases lead to prominent instability in the cavity
shell. The RT cases do not show such instability. The gray FLD method
underestimates the opacity at the location of the cavity shell and leads to
extended epochs of marginal Eddington equilibrium in the cavity shell, making
them prone to the radiative Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the RT cases, the
radiation pressure exceeds gravity by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The radiative
Rayleigh-Taylor instability is then consequently suppressed.
  Conclusions: Treating the stellar irradiation in the gray FLD approximation
underestimates the radiative forces acting on the cavity shell. This can lead
artificially to situations that are affected by the radiative Rayleigh-Taylor
instability. The proper treatment of direct stellar irradiation by massive
stars is crucial for the stability of radiation-pressure-dominated cavities.

processing. It allows us to estimate the state of a quantum system by measuring
different observables on many identically prepared copies of the system. This

measurements. There are, however, systems in which the data acquisition can be
done more efficiently. In fact, an ensemble of quantum systems can be prepared
and manipulated by external fields while being continuously and collectively
probed, producing enough information to estimate its state. This provides a
basis for continuous measurement quantum tomography. In this protocol, an
ensemble of identically prepared systems is collectively probed and controlled
in a time-dependent manner to create an informationally complete continuous
measurement record. The measurement history is then inverted to determine the
state at the initial time. We use two different estimation methods: maximum
likelihood and compressed sensing. The general formalism is applied to the case
of reconstruction of the quantum state encoded in the magnetic sub-levels of a
large-spin alkali atom, ${}^{133}$Cs. We apply this protocol to the case of

center of the Milky Way have been historically neglected. The presence of
patchy differential reddening in front of these clusters has proven to be a
significant obstacle to their detailed study. We present here a well-defined
and reasonably homogeneous photometric database for 25 of the brightest
Galactic globular clusters located in the direction of the inner Galaxy. These
data were obtained in the B, V, and I bands using the Magellan 6.5m telescope
and the Hubble Space Telescope. A new technique is extensively used in this
paper to map the differential reddening in the individual cluster fields, and
to produce cleaner, dereddened color-magnitude diagrams for all the clusters in
the database. Subsequent papers will detail the astrophysical analysis of the
cluster populations, and the properties of the obscuring material along the
clusters' lines of sight.

whose removal from $G$ results in a graph with larger domination number.
Recently Gagarin and Zverovich showed that, for a graph $G$ with maximum degree
$\Delta(G)$ and embeddable on an orientable surface of genus $h$ and a
non-orientable surface of genus $k$,
$b(G)\leq\min\{\Delta(G)+h+2,\Delta+k+1\}$. They also gave examples showing
that adjustments of their proofs implicitly provide better results for larger
values of $h$ and $k$. In this paper we establish an improved explicit upper
bound for $b(G)$, using the Euler characteristic $\chi$ instead of the genera
$h$ and $k$, with the relations $\chi=2-2h$ and $\chi=2-k$. We show that
$b(G)\leq\Delta(G)+\lfloor r\rfloor$ for the case $\chi\leq0$ (i.e. $h\geq1$ or
$k\geq2$), where $r$ is the largest real root of the cubic equation
$z^3+2z^2+(6\chi-7)z+18\chi-24=0$. Our proof is based on the technique
developed by Carlson-Develin and Gagarin-Zverovich, and includes some
elementary calculus as a new ingredient. We also find an asymptotically
equivalent result $b(G)\leq\Delta(G)+\lceil\sqrt{12-6\chi\,}-1/2\rceil$ for
$\chi\leq0$, and a further improvement for graphs with large girth.

contemplate the possibility that some types of particles (or macroscopic

particular might apply to the DSR description of the macroscopic bodies that
constitute measuring devices (""observers""). The formalization is also
applicable to cases where different fundamental particles have different
relativistic properties, leading to a type of phenomenology which I illustrate
by considering possible applications to the ongoing analyses of the

reversible multi-pass watermarking and is required for analysis before any

estimating the embedding capacity of a given cover image under multi-pass
embedding, without actually embedding the watermark. We demonstrate this for a
class of reversible watermarking schemes which operate on a disjoint group of
pixels, specifically for pixel pairs. The proposed algorithm iteratively
updates the co-occurrence matrix at every stage, to estimate the multi-pass
embedding capacity, and is much more efficient vis-a-vis actual watermarking.
We also suggest an extremely efficient, pre-computable tree based
implementation which is conceptually similar to the co-occurrence based method,
but provides the estimates in a single iteration, requiring a complexity akin
to that of single pass capacity estimation. We also provide bounds on the
embedding capacity. We finally show how our method can be easily used on a
number of watermarking algorithms and specifically evaluate the performance of
our algorithms on the benchmark watermarking schemes of Tian [11] and Coltuc
[6].

conjunction with simulated data, it becomes possible to also extract the
interface trap density of these objects. These are important results, also
because these parameters are extracted directly on state-of-the-art devices and

coexistence of two types of Ce ions in a metallic environment, namely trivalent
Ce3+ and intermediate valent Ce(4-x)+. Charge ordering produces a doubling of
the unit cell along the c-axis with respect to the basic monoclinic CeCoAl type
structure. Below room temperature, a phase transition with very broad
hysteresis has been observed in various bulk properties like electrical
resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The present x-ray
diffraction results show that at low temperatures the doubling of the CeCoAl
type structure is replaced by an ill-defined modulated ground state. In this
state, at least three different modulation periods compete, with the dominant
mode close to a tripling of the basic cell. The transition is accompanied by a
significant contraction of the c axis. XANES data suggest that the average Ce
valence remains constant, thus the observed c axis contraction is not due to
any valence transition. We propose a qualitative structure model with modified
stacking sequences of Ce3+ and Ce(4-x)+ layers in the various modulated phases.
Surprisingly, far below 100 K the modulated state is sensitive to x-ray
irradiation at photon fluxes available at a synchrotron. With photon fluxes of
order 10E12/s, the modulated ground state can be destroyed on a timescale of
minutes and the doubling of the CeCoAl cell observed at room temperature is
recovered. The final state is metastable at 10 K. Heating the sample above 60 K
again leads to a recovery of the modulated state. Thus, CeRuSn exhibits both
thermally and x-ray induced reversible transformations of the Ce3+/Ce(4-x)+
charge ordering pattern. Such a behavior is unique among any know intermetallic
compound.

the mass and radius of the white dwarf in SDSS J1212-0123 are consistent with

such a low mass and in a short period binary must have a helium core. The mass

white dwarf has a very thin hydrogen envelope, which has not been predicted by
evolutionary models. The mass and radius of the secondary star in GK Vir are

phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 Mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 Mpc^-3
and alpha_2 = -1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the
flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey
main sample (r < 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the
i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF
below 10^8 Msun is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected
requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low
surface-brightness galaxies.

In this paper, we focus on the fundamental diagram, and on the relation between

While the latter was found to be linear in previous experiments, we show that
it is rather a piecewise linear behavior which is found if larger density
ranges are covered. Indeed, our data clearly exhibits three distinct regimes in
the behavior of pedestrians that follow each other. The transitions between
these regimes occur at spatial headways of about 1.1 and 3 m, respectively.

Band (NEB) method does not determine the correct Peierls barrier of 1/2<111>
screw dislocations in BCC metals. Although this method guarantees that the
states (images) of the system are distributed uniformly along the minimum
energy path, it does not imply that the dislocation positions are distributed
uniformly along this path. In fact, clustering of dislocation positions near
potential minima occurs which leads to an overestimate of both the slope of the
Peierls barrier and the Peierls stress. We propose a modification in which the
NEB method is applied only to a small number of degrees of freedom that
determine the position of the dislocation, while all other coordinates of atoms
are relaxed by molecular statics as in any atomistic study. This modified NEB
method with relaxations gives the Peierls barrier that increases smoothly with
the dislocation position and the corresponding Peierls stress agrees well with
that evaluated by the direct application of stress in the atomistic modeling of
the dislocation glide.

parameter on a diurnal, seasonal and long-term time-scale. The model should be
accurate and general (comprehensive) enough for efficiently approximating the
high variations of vTEC. However, good approximation and generalization are
conflicting objectives. For this reason a Genetic Programming (GP) with

approximation of the modeled parameter and can be implemented as a local model
to account for the ionospheric imposed error in positioning. Particulary, the

of masses as low as M~7.6 10^9 Msun at z~3. Although the area used is
relatively small (~33 arcmin^2), we found generally good agreement with
previous studies on the entire mass range. Our results show that the slope of
the faint-end increases with redshift, from alpha=-1.44+/-0.03 at z~0.8 to
alpha=-1.86+/-0.16 at z~3, although indications exist that it does not steepen
further between z~3 and z~4. This result is insensitive to any uncertainty in

formation history at z>2. However, we confirm the that there appears to be an
excess of integrated star formation with respect to the SMD at z<2, by a factor

that the models forecast a greater abundance of low mass galaxies, at least up

sustained by their own quantum fluctuations, in the context of modified
dispersion relations. More specifically, the energy density of the graviton
one-loop contribution to a classical energy in a wormhole background is
considered as a self-consistent source for wormholes. In this semi-classical
context, we consider specific choices for the Rainbow's functions and find
solutions for wormhole geometries in the cis-planckian and trans-planckian
regimes. In the former regime, the wormhole spacetimes are not asymptotically
flat and need to be matched to an exterior vacuum solution. In the latter
trans-planckian regime, we find that the quantum corrections are exponentially
suppressed, which provide asymptotically flat wormhole geometries with a
constant shape function, i.e., b(r)=r_t, where r_t is the wormhole throat. In
addition to this analysis, we also fix the geometry by considering the
behaviour of a specific shape function through a variational approach which
imposes a local analysis to the problem at the wormhole throat. We further
explore the respective parameter range of the Rainbow's functions, and find a
good agreement with previous work.

state in PbBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. A single surface Dirac cone is observed by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with synchrotron radiation.
Topological invariants $\mathbb{Z}_2$ are calculated from the {\it ab initio}
band structure to be 1; (111). The observed two-dimensional iso-energy contours
in the bulk energy gap are found to be the largest among the known
three-dimensional topological insulators. This opens a pathway to achieving a
sufficiently large spin current density in future spintronic devices.

and operate the next generation gamma-ray spectrometer. AGATA is based on the
technique of gamma-ray energy tracking in electrically segmented high-purity
germanium crystals. This technique requires the accurate determination of the
energy, time and position of every interaction as a gamma ray deposits its
energy within the detector volume. Reconstruction of the full interaction path
results in a detector with very high efficiency and excellent spectral
response. The realization of gamma-ray tracking and AGATA is a result of many
technical advances. These include the development of encapsulated
highly-segmented germanium detectors assembled in a triple cluster detector
cryostat, an electronics system with fast digital sampling and a data
acquisition system to process the data at a high rate. The full
characterization of the crystals was measured and compared with
detector-response simulations. This enabled pulse-shape analysis algorithms, to
extract energy, time and position, to be employed. In addition, tracking
algorithms for event reconstruction were developed. The first phase of AGATA is
now complete and operational in its first physics campaign. In the future AGATA
will be moved between laboratories in Europe and operated in a series of
campaigns to take advantage of the different beams and facilities available to
maximize its science output. The paper reviews all the achievements made in the
AGATA project including all the necessary infrastructure to operate and support
the spectrometer.

terminals, each having access to some kind of side information. In this case,
standard coding techniques are either prohibitively complex to decode, or
require network-source coding separation, resulting in sub-optimal transmission
rates. To alleviate this problem, we offer a joint network-source coding scheme
based on matrix sparsification at the code design phase, which allows the
terminals to use an efficient decoding procedure (syndrome decoding using
LDPC), despite the network coding throughout the network. Via a novel relation
between matrix sparsification and rate-distortion theory, we give lower and
upper bounds on the best achievable sparsification performance. These bounds
allow us to analyze our scheme, and, in particular, show that in the limit
where all receivers have comparable side information (in terms of conditional
entropy), or, equivalently, have weak side information, a vanishing density can
be achieved. As a result, efficient decoding is possible at all terminals
simultaneously. Simulation results motivate the use of this scheme at
non-limiting rates as well.

is so hard to get a consensus for the shape and density law of the bulge, as
seen from the literature. To solve the problem we use the Besancon Galaxy Model
to provide a scheme for parameter fitting of the structural characteristics of
the bulge region. The fitting process allows the determination of the global
shape of the bulge main structure.
  We explore various parameters and shape for the bulge/bar structure based on
Ferrer's ellipsoids and fit the shape of the inner disc in the same process.
The results show that the main structure is a quite standard triaxial boxy
bar/bulge with an orientation of about 13 degree with respect to the Sun-centre
direction. But the fit is greatly improved when we add a second structure,
which is a longer and thicker ellipsoid. We emphasize that our first ellipsoid
represent the main boxy bar of the Galaxy, and that the thick bulge could be
either a classical bulge slightly flattened by the effect of the bar potential,
or a inner thick disc counterpart. We show that the double clump seen at
intermediate latitudes can be reproduced by adding a slight flare to the bar.
In order to better characterize the populations, we further simulate several
fields which have been surveyed in spectroscopy and for which metallicity
distribution function (MDF) are available. The model is in good agreement with
these MDF along the minor axis if we assume that the main bar has a mean solar
metallicity and the second thicker population has a lower metallicity. It then
creates naturally a vertical metallicity gradient by the mixing of the two
poulations. (abridged)

measurements (isolated or not by space-like intervals) on a given system, the
most general sufficient condition for factorability on \lambda\ is obtained by
finding a set of expressions M_i=M_i(\lambda,\xi_i), with {\xi_i} a set of
HV's, all independent from one another and from \lambda. Otherwise,
factorability can be recovered on \gamma = \lambda\ \oplus\ \mu, with \mu\
another additional HV, so that a description M_i=M_i(\gamma,\xi_i) is again
found: conceptually, this is always possible; experimentally, it may not: \mu\
may be unaccessible or even its existence unknown (and so, too, from the point
of view of a phenomenological theory). Results here may help clarify our recent
post in [6].

the constraints (at the classical level) is the Nambu-Goto action, and the

and includes the possibility to considerably increase the user capacity and
fully exploit the high repetition rate of the European XFEL. In fact, dealing
with monochromatic hard X-ray radiation one may use crystals as deflectors with
minimum beam loss. To this end, a photon beam distribution system based on the
use of crystals in the Bragg reflection geometry is proposed for future study
and possible extension of the baseline facility. They can be repeated a number
of times to form an almost complete (one meter scale) ring with an angle of 20
degrees between two neighboring lines. The reflectivity of crystal deflectors
can be switched fast enough by flipping the crystals with piezo-electric
devices similar to those for X-ray phase retarders at synchrotron radiation

specification of authorization policies. For some proposals, such as XACML, the
main motivation is to address real-world requirements, typically by providing a
complex policy language with somewhat informal evaluation methods; others try
to provide a greater degree of formality (particularly with respect to policy
evaluation) but support far fewer features. In short, there are very few
proposals that combine a rich set of language features with a well-defined
semantics, and even fewer that do this for authorization policies for
attribute-based access control in open environments. In this paper, we
decompose the problem of policy specification into two distinct sub-languages:
the policy target language (PTL) for target specification, which determines
when a policy should be evaluated; and the policy composition language (PCL)
for building more complex policies from existing ones. We define syntax and
semantics for two such languages and demonstrate that they can be both simple
and expressive. PTaCL, the language obtained by combining the features of these
two sub-languages, supports the specification of a wide range of policies.
However, the power of PTaCL means that it is possible to define policies that
could produce unexpected results. We provide an analysis of how PTL should be
restricted and how policies written in PCL should be evaluated to minimize the

vetoes (LAVs) must detect particles with better than 1 ns time resolution and
10% energy resolution over a very large energy range. Our custom readout board
uses a time-over-threshold discriminator coupled to a TDC as a straightforward

extensively tested together with the ANTI-A2 large angle veto module at CERN in

and clusters of galaxies as measured in a number of recent works. As previously
noted by several authors, low-mass clusters and groups of galaxies display
systematically larger concentrations than simple prescriptions based on pure
$n$-body simulations would predict. This implies an observed concentration-mass
relation with a substantially larger slope/normalization than expected from
theoretical investigations. Additionally, this conclusion seems to be quite
independent on selection effects, holding for both lensing based and X-ray
based cluster samples. In order to shed new light on this issue I employ a
simple spherical halo model containing, in addition to dark matter, also stars
and hot diffuse gas in proportions and with distributions in agreement with the
most recent observations. Moreover, I include the contraction effect
experienced by dark matter due to the cooling of baryons in the very central
part of the structure itself. The resulting modified concentration-mass
relation is steeper than the theoretical input one, because star formation is
fractionally more efficient in low-mass objects. However, the effect is
non-vanishing at all masses, thus resulting also in a larger normalization.
Overall the new relation provides a better representation of the observed one
for almost all catalogs considered in this work, although the specific details
depend quite significantly on the baryon fraction prescription adopted. Anyhow,
the same effect could also be produced by a redistribution of baryons within
the structure. Finally I use this simple model to show how the estimated
concentration of cosmic structures is expected to be overestimated as a
function of the radial range covered by the analysis. (abridged)

Coarse-Grain (CG) model. Within this approach, the coarse grain objects of the
simulation are not fixed a priori at the beginning of the simulation but rather
redefined on the fly. The motion of the CG objects (single particles or
aggregates) is described by an anisotropic diffusion model and the magnetic
dipole-dipole interaction is replaced by an effective short range interaction
between CG objects. The new methodology correctly reproduces previous results
from detailed Langevin Dynamics simulations of dispersions of superparamagnetic
colloids under strong fields whilst requiring an amount of CPU time orders of
magnitude smaller. This substantial improvement in the computational
requirements allows the simulation of problems in which the relevant phenomena
extends to time scales inaccessible with previous simulation techniques. A
relevant example is the waiting time dependence of the relaxation time T_2 of
water protons observed in Magnetic Resonance experiments containing dispersions
of superparamagnetic colloids, which is correctly predicted by our simulations.
Future applications may include other popular real-world applications of
superparamagnetic colloids such as the magnetophoretic separation processes.

Coulomb forces, the radiation reaction forces are taken into account. This
modification brings in the model a new qualitative feature of a global
character. Indeed, as pointed out by Dirac, in any model of classical
electrodynamics of point particles involving radiation reaction one has to
eliminate, from the a priori conceivable solutions of the problem, those
corresponding to the emission of an infinite amount of energy. We show that the
Dirac prescription solves a problem of inconsistency plaguing all available
models which neglect radiation reaction, namely, the fact that in all such
models most initial data lead to a spontaneous breakdown of the atom. A further
modification is that the system thus acquires a peculiar form of dissipation.
In particular, this makes attractive an invariant manifold of special physical
interest, the zero--dipole manifold, that corresponds to motions in which no
energy is radiated away (in the dipole approximation). We finally study
numerically the invariant measure naturally induced by the time--evolution on
such a manifold, and this corresponds to studying the formation process of the
atom. Indications are given that such a measure may be singular with respect to
that of Lebesgue.

electromagnetic radiation will enable wireless networks to be self sustaining
besides alleviating global warming. In this paper, the spatial throughput of a
mobile ad hoc network powered by energy harvesting is analyzed using a
stochastic-geometry model. In this model, transmitters are distributed as a
Poisson point process and energy arrives at each transmitter randomly with a
uniform average rate called the energy arrival rate; upon harvesting sufficient
energy, each transmitter transmits with fixed power to an intended receiver
under an outage-probability constraint for a target
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. It is assumed that transmitters store
energy in batteries with infinite capacity. By applying the random-walk theory,
the probability that a transmitter transmits, called the transmission
probability, is proved to be equal to one if the energy-arrival rate exceeds
transmission power or otherwise is equal to their ratio. This result and tools
from stochastic geometry are applied to maximize the network throughput for a
given energy-arrival rate by optimizing transmission power. The maximum network
throughput is shown to be proportional to the optimal transmission probability,
which is equal to one if the transmitter density is below a derived function of
the energy-arrival rate or otherwise is smaller than one and solves a given
polynomial equation. Last, the limits of the maximum network throughput are
obtained for the extreme cases of high energy-arrival rates and dense networks.

throes of massive stars, the identification of their progenitors has proved
challenging. Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best
candidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a
direct measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry
may be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.
Spectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have
spherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%
minority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here
we find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the
signature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae
that have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue
variable phase. As these youthful WR stars have yet to spin-down due to mass
loss, they are the best candidate GRB progenitors identified to date. When we
take recently published WR ejecta nebula numbers we find that five out of the
six line-effect WR stars are surrounded by ejecta nebulae. The statistics imply
that the null hypothesis of no correlation between line-effect WR stars and
ejecta nebulae can be rejected at the 0.0004% level. Given that four
line-effect and WR ejecta nebula have spectroscopically been confirmed to
contain nucleosynthetic products, we argue that the correlation is both
statistically significant and physically convincing. The implication is that we
have identified a WR sub-population that fulfills the necessary criteria for
making GRBs. Finally, we discuss the potential of identifying GRB progenitors
via spectropolarimetry with extremely large telescopes.

  CNA_0412_CO_F_1 to CNA_0412_CO_F_4",,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a novel encryption-less algorithm to enhance
security in transmission of data packets across mobile ad hoc networks. The
paper hinges on the paradigm of multipath routing and exploits the properties
of polynomials. The first step in the algorithm is to transform the data such
that it is impossible to obtain any information without possessing the entire
transformed data. The algorithm then uses an intuitively simple idea of a
jigsaw puzzle to break the transformed data into multiple packets where these
packets form the pieces of the puzzle. Then these packets are sent along
disjoint paths to reach the receiver. A secure and efficient mechanism is
provided to convey the information that is necessary for obtaining the original
data at the receiver-end from its fragments in the packets, that is, for
solving the jigsaw puzzle. The algorithm is designed to be secure so that no
intermediate or unintended node can obtain the entire data. An authentication
code is also used to ensure authenticity of every packet.

Fifty two legal codes are selected on the basis of explicit legal criteria and
considered as vertices with their mutual quotations forming the edges in a
network which properties are analyzed relying on graph theory. We find that a
group of 10 codes are simultaneously the most citing and the most cited by
other codes, and are also strongly connected together so forming a ""rich club""
sub-graph. Three other code communities are also found that somewhat partition
the legal field is distinct thematic sub-domains. The legal interpretation of
this partition is opening new untraditional lines of research. We also
conjecture that many legal systems are forming such new kind of networks that
share some properties in common with small worlds but are far denser. We
propose to call ""concentrated world"".
