  Coefficients on an Arbitrary Interface, I: One Dimensional Problems",,,,,"math.NA math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a one dimensional second order accurate method to
solve Elliptic equations with discontinuous coefficients on an arbitrary
interface. Second order accuracy for the first derivative is obtained as well.
The method is based on the Ghost Fluid Method, making use of ghost points on
which the value is defined by suitable interface conditions. The multi-domain
formulation is adopted, where the problem is split in two sub-problems and
interface conditions will be enforced to close the problem. Interface
conditions are relaxed together with the internal equations, leading to an
iterative method on all the set of grid values (inside points and ghost
points). A multigrid approach with a suitable definition of the restriction
operator is provided. The restriction of the defect is performed separately for
both sub-problems, providing a convergence factor close to the one measured in
the case of smooth coefficient and independent on the magnitude of the jump in
the coefficient. Numerical tests will confirm the second order accuracy.
Although the method is proposed in one dimension, the extension in higher
dimension is currently underway.

still poorly understood. Indeed, not even a clear dividing line between massive
planets and brown dwarfs has been established yet. This is partly due to the
paucity of this kind of objects orbiting close to solar-type stars, the
so-called brown dwarf desert, that hinders setting up a strong observational
base to compare to models and theories of formation and evolution.
  We search to increase the current sample of massive sub-stellar objects with
precise orbital parameters, and to constrain the true mass of detected
sub-stellar candidates.
  The initial identification of sub-stellar candidates is done using precise
radial velocity measurements obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the
1.93-m telescope of the Haute-Provence Observatory. Subsequent characterisation
of these candidates, with the principal aim of identifying stellar companions
in low-inclination orbits, is done by means of different spectroscopic
diagnostics, as the measurement of the bisector velocity span and the study of
the correlation mask effect. With this objective, we also employed astrometric
data from the Hipparcos mission and a novel method of simulating stellar
cross-correlation functions.
  Seven new objects with minimum masses between ~ 10 Mjup and ~90 Mjup are
detected. Out of these, two are identified as low-mass stars in low-inclination
orbits, and two others have masses below the theoretical deuterium-burning
limit, and are therefore planetary candidates. The remaining three are brown
dwarf candidates; the current upper limits for their the masses do not allow us
to conclude on their nature. Additionally, we have improved on the parameters
of an already-known brown dwarf (HD137510b), confirmed by astrometry.

becomes more curved and hence less favorable for antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations. While our study does not allow a quantitative understanding of

Chandra in M31 with a luminosity at ~ 5 x 10^39 erg/s. Here we analyse a series
of five subsequent XMM-Newton observations. The steady decline in X-ray
luminosity over 1.5 months gives an observed e-fold timescale of ~40 days;
similar to the decay timescales seen in soft X-ray transients in our own
Galaxy. This supports the interpretation of this ULX as a stellar mass black
hole in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), accreting at super Eddington rates.
This is further supported by the lack of detection of an O/B star in quiescence
and the XMM-Newton spectral data being dominated by a disc-like component
rather than the power-law expected from a sub-Eddington intermediate-mass black
hole.
  These data give the best sequence of high Eddington fraction spectra ever
assembled due to the combination of low absorption column to M31 and well
calibrated bandpass down to 0.3 keV of XMM-Newton. The spectra can be roughly
described by our best current disc model, BHSPEC, assuming a 10 M_solar black
hole with best fit spin of ~0.4. However, the data are better described by a
two component model, where the disc emission is significantly affected by
advection, and with an additional low temperature Comptonisation component at
high energies. This could simply indicate the limitations of current disc
models, though the energy-dependent variability also weakly supports a two
component interpretation of the data.
  Irrespective of the detailed interpretation of the spectral properties, these
data support the presence of accretion onto a stellar mass black hole in a LMXB
accreting in the Eddington-regime. This allows an unambiguous connection of
this object, and, by extension, similar low luminosity ULXs, to `standard'
X-ray binaries.

  and Signal Processing (ICASSP' 2012)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider downlink cellular multi-user communication between a base station
(BS) having N antennas and M single-antenna users, i.e., an N X M Gaussian
Broadcast Channel (GBC). Under an average only total transmit power constraint
(APC), large antenna arrays at the BS (having tens to a few hundred antennas)
have been recently shown to achieve remarkable multi-user interference (MUI)
suppression with simple precoding techniques. However, building large arrays in
practice, would require cheap/power-efficient Radio-Frequency(RF) electronic
components. The type of transmitted signal that facilitates the use of most
power-efficient RF components is a constant envelope (CE) signal. Under certain
mild channel conditions (including i.i.d. fading), we analytically show that,
even under the stringent per-antenna CE transmission constraint (compared to
APC), MUI suppression can still be achieved with large antenna arrays. Our
analysis also reveals that, with a fixed M and increasing N, the total
transmitted power can be reduced while maintaining a constant
signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) level at each user. We also propose a
novel low-complexity CE precoding scheme, using which, we confirm our
analytical observations for the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel, through
Monte-Carlo simulations. Simulation of the information sum-rate under the
per-antenna CE constraint, shows that, for a fixed M and a fixed desired
sum-rate, the required total transmit power decreases linearly with increasing
N, i.e., an O(N) array power gain. Also, in terms of the total transmit power
required to achieve a fixed desired information sum-rate, despite the stringent
per-antenna CE constraint, the proposed CE precoding scheme performs close to
the GBC sum-capacity (under APC) achieving scheme.

knots. To model the emission from the radio knots. Methods: We analyzed archive
data and also obtained new Very Large Array observations of this source, as
well as an optical image, to measure the present position of the knots. We also
modeled the radio emission from the knots in terms of shocks in a jet with
intrinsically time-dependent ejection velocities. Results: We detected radio
knots in the 1996.98 and 2009.62 VLA data. These radio knots are,within error,
coincident with optical knots. We also modeled satisfactorily the observed
radio flux densities as shock features from a jet with intrinsic variability.
All the observed radio, optical, and X-ray knot positions can be intepreted as
four successive knots, ejected with a period of 4.80 years and traveling away
from the source with a velocity of 198 km s$^{-1}$ in the plane of the sky.
Conclusions: The radio and optical knots are spatially correlated and our model
can explain the observed radio flux densities. However, the X-ray knots do not
appear to have optical or radio counterparts and their nature remains poorly
understood.

strategy using adaptive rules based on runtime performance. The global strategy
optimizes the location of a set of solutions (particles) in the parameter

different stages of the optimization based on the adaptive rules. After the LM
adjustment of the subset of particle positions, the updated particles are
returned to the APSO strategy. The advantages of coupling APSO and LM in the

vary from modest (e.g., a typical meta-analysis) to large (e.g., a strong
gene--environment interaction). However, existing statistical tools are limited
in their ability to address such heterogeneity. Indeed, most genetic
association meta-analyses use a ""fixed effects"" analysis, which assumes no
heterogeneity. Here we develop and apply Bayesian association methods to
address this problem. These methods are easy to apply (in the simplest case,
requiring only a point estimate for the genetic effect and its standard error,
from each subgroup) and effectively include standard frequentist meta-analysis
methods, including the usual ""fixed effects"" analysis, as special cases. We
apply these tools to two large genetic association studies: one a meta-analysis
of genome-wide association studies from the Global Lipids consortium, and the
second a cross-population analysis for expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTLs). In the Global Lipids data we find, perhaps surprisingly, that effects
are generally quite homogeneous across studies. In the eQTL study we find that
eQTLs are generally shared among different continental groups, and discuss
consequences of this for study design.

the data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). Galaxies
are classified by colour, nuclear activity and star-formation activity to
calculate average spectra of high signal-to-noise ratio and resolution (S/N =
132 - 4760 at {Dlambda = 1 A), using an algorithm that is robust against
outliers. Besides composite spectra, we also compute the first five principal
components of the distributions in each galaxy class to characterize the nature
of variations of individual spectra around the averages. The continua of the
composite spectra are fitted with BC03 stellar population synthesis models to
extend the wavelength coverage beyond the coverage of the SDSS spectrographs.
Common derived parameters of the composites are also calculated: integrated
colours in the most popular filter systems, line strength measurements, and
continuum absorption indices (including Lick indices). These derived parameters
are compared with the distributions of parameters of individual galaxies and it
is shown on many examples that the composites of the atlas cover much of the
parameter space spanned by SDSS galaxies. By co-adding thousands of spectra, a
total integration time of several months can be reached, which results in
extremely low noise composites. The variations in redshift not only allow for
extending the spectral coverage bluewards to the original wavelength limit of
the SDSS spectrographs, but also make higher spectral resolution achievable.

Mbar-scale plasmas through the merging of thirty plasma jets in a spherically
convergent geometry. A long coherence length, 320 mW laser allows for a strong,
sub-fringe phase-shift signal without the need for closely-matched probe and
reference path lengths. Thus only one reference path is required for all eight
probe paths, and an individual probe chord can be altered without altering the
reference or other probe path lengths. Fiber-optic decoupling of the probe
chord optics on the vacuum chamber from the rest of the system allows the probe
paths to be easily altered to focus on different spatial regions of the plasma.

broad correlation between stellar mass and UV luminosity, such that more
UV-luminous galaxies are, on average, more massive. However, the correlation
has a substantial intrinsic scatter evidenced by a non-negligible number of
UV-faint but massive galaxies. Furthermore, the low-mass end of the SMF does
not rise as steeply as the UV luminosity function (alpha_UVLF} -(1.7-1.8),
alpha_SMF -(1.3-1.4)) of the same galaxies. In a smooth formation scenario
where star formation (SF) is sustained at the observed rates for a long time,
these galaxies would have accumulated more mass (by a factor of ~3) than
observed and therefore the SMF would mirror more closely that of the UVLF. The
relatively shallow slope of the SMF is due to the fact that many of the
UV-selected galaxies are not massive enough, and therefore are too faint in
their rest-frame optical bands, to be detected in the current observations. Our
results favor a episodic formation history in which SF in low-mass galaxies
vary significantly over time, a scenario favored by galaxy clustering. Our
findings for the UV-faint galaxies are in contrast with those found for more
UV-luminous galaxies, which exhibit tighter SFR-M_star correlations. The
discrepancy may suggest that galaxies at different luminosities may have
different evolutionary paths.

of 900pc from an HII region with strong signatures of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.
While this ""WR region"" produces less than 5% of the B-band emission of the
host, we find that it is responsible for 45+/-10% of the total infrared
luminosity, with a maximum contribution reaching 75% at 25-30mic. This atypical
property is rarely observed among morphologically-relaxed dwarves, suggesting a
strong causal link with the GRB event. The luminosity of the WR region
(L_8-1000mic=4.6x10^8 Lsol), the peak of its spectral energy distribution at
<~100mic and the presence of highly-ionized emission lines (e.g., [NeIII]) also
reveal extremely young (<5Myr) star-forming activity, with a typical time-scale
of only 47Myr to double the stellar mass already built. Finally, the mid-IR
over B-band luminosity ratio in this region is substantially higher than in
star-forming galaxies with similar L_IR, but it is lower than in young
dust-enshrouded stellar clusters. Considering the modest obscuration measured
from the silicate features (tau_9.7mic ~ 0.015), this suggests that the WR
region is dominated by one or several star clusters that have either partly
escaped or cleared out their parent molecular cloud. Combined with the
properties characterizing the whole population of GRB hosts, our results
reinforce the idea that long GRBs mostly happen within or in the vicinity of
relatively unobscured galactic regions harboring very recent star formation.

high-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport and
inflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near AGN, triggered either during galaxy
mergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. Sudden misalignments can
sometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly
off-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth
and trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested,
self-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in
the potential of the outer modes. Resonant angular momentum exchange can flip
or re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without the
presence of massive clumps. We therefore do not expect that AGN and their host
galaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative alignment be
an indicator of the AGN fueling mechanism. We discuss implications of this
conclusion for AGN feedback and BH spin evolution. The misalignments may mean
that even BHs accreting from smooth large-scale disks will not be spun up to
maximal rotation, and so have more modest radiative efficiencies and
inefficient jet formation. Even more random orientations are possible if there
is further, un-resolved clumpiness in the gas, and more ordered accretion may
occur if the inflow is slower and not self-gravitating.

be light and the proton long lived without producing missing energy signals at
the LHC. Our approach differs from that of Nikolidakis and Smith in that we
impose holomorphy on the MFV spurions. The resulting model is highly
constrained and R-parity emerges as an accidental approximate symmetry of the
low-energy Lagrangian. The size of the small R-parity violating terms is
determined by the flavor parameters, and in the absence of neutrino masses
there is only one renormalizable R-parity violating interaction: the
baryon-number violating $\bar{u}\bar{d}\bar{d}$ superpotential term. Low energy
observables (proton decay, dinucleon decay and $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation) pose
only mild constraints on the parameter space. LHC phenomenology will depend on

magnetic properties of stars observed using high-resolution circular
spectropolarimetry in the context of large surveys. This approach is well
suited for analysing stars for which the stellar rotation period is not known,
and therefore the rotational phases of the observations are ambiguous. The
model assumes that the magnetic observations correspond to a dipole oblique
rotator, a situation commonly encountered in intermediate and high-mass stars.
Using reasonable assumptions regarding the model parameter prior probability
density distributions, the Bayesian algorithm determines the posterior
probability densities corresponding to the surface magnetic field geometry and
strength by performing a comparison between the observed and computed Stokes V
profiles.
  Based on the results of numerical simulations, we conclude that this method
yields a useful estimate of the surface dipole field strength based on a small
number (i.e. 1 or 2) of observations. On the other hand, the method provides
only weak constraints on the dipole geometry. The odds ratio, a parameter
computed by the algorithm that quantifies the relative appropriateness of the
magnetic dipole model versus the non-magnetic model, provides a more sensitive
diagnostic of the presence of weak magnetic signals embedded in noise than
traditional techniques.
  To illustrate the application of the technique to real data, we analyse seven
ESPaDOnS and Narval observations of the early B-type magnetic star LP Ori.
Insufficient information is available to determine the rotational period of the
star and therefore the phase of the data; hence traditional modelling
techniques fail to infer the dipole strength. In contrast, the Bayesian method
allows a robust determination of the dipole polar strength,

Large Area Telescope (LAT) has been steadily increasing. A number of the more
recent detections, including PSR J0034-0534, PSR J1939+2134 (B1937+21; the
first MSP ever discovered), PSR J1959+2048 (B1957+20; the first black widow
system), and PSR J2214+3000 exhibit an unusual phenomenon: nearly phase-aligned
radio and gamma-ray light curves (LCs). To account for the phase alignment, we
explore geometric models where both the radio and gamma-ray emission originate
either in the outer magnetosphere near the light cylinder (R_LC) or near the
polar caps (PCs). We obtain reasonable fits for the first three of these MSPs
in the context of ""altitude-limited"" outer gap (alOG) and two-pole caustic
(alTPC) geometries. The outer magnetosphere phase-aligned models differ from
the standard outer gap (OG) / two-pole caustic (TPC) models in two respects:
first, the radio emission originates in caustics at relatively high altitudes
compared to the usual low-altitude conal radio beams; second, we allow the
maximum altitude of the gamma-ray emission region as well as both the minimum
and maximum altitudes of the radio emission region to vary within a limited
range. Alternatively, there also exist phase-aligned LC solutions for emission
originating near the stellar surface in a slot gap (SG) scenario (""low-altitude
slot gap"" (laSG) models). We find best-fit LCs using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) maximum likelihood approach. Our fits imply that the phase-aligned LCs
are likely of caustic origin, produced in the outer magnetosphere, and that the
radio emission may come from close to R_LC. We lastly constrain the emission
altitudes with typical uncertainties of ~0.3R_LC. Our results describe a third
gamma-ray MSP subclass, in addition to the two (with non-aligned LCs)
previously found.

in the interior of spiral arms in galaxies, compared to inter-arm regions.
However, recent studies have found that the star formation inside the arms is
not more efficient than elsewhere in the galaxy. Previous studies have based
their conclusion mainly on integrated light. We use resolved stellar
populations to investigate the star formation rates throughout the nearby
spiral galaxy NGC 5236. We aim to investigate how the star formation rate
varies in the spiral arms compared to the inter-arm regions, using optical
space-based observations of NGC 5236. Using ground-based H\alpha images we
traced regions of recent star formation, and reconstructed the arms of the
galaxy. Using HST/ACS images we estimate star formation histories by means of
the synthetic CMD method. Arms based on H\alpha images showed to follow the
regions where stellar crowding is higher. Star formation rates for individual
arms over the fields covered were estimated between 10 to 100 Myr, where the
stellar photometry is less affected by incompleteness. Comparison between arms
and inter-arm surface star formation rate densities (\Sigma$_{SFR}$) suggested
higher values in the arms (\sim0.6 dex). Over a small fraction of one arm we
checked how the \Sigma$_{SFR}$ changes for the trailing and leading part. The
leading part of the arm showed to have a higher \Sigma$_{SFR}$ in the age range
10-100 Myr. Predictions from the density wave theory of a rapid increase in the
star formation at the edge where the stars and the gas enter the density wave
are confirmed. The \Sigma$_{SFR}$ presents a steep decrease with distance from
the center of the arms through the inter-arm regions.

TranSteg (Transcoding Steganography). Typically, in steganographic
communication it is advised for covert data to be compressed in order to limit
its size. In TranSteg it is the overt data that is compressed to make space for
the steganogram. The main innovation of TranSteg is to, for a chosen voice
stream, find a codec that will result in a similar voice quality but smaller
voice payload size than the originally selected. Then, the voice stream is
transcoded. At this step the original voice payload size is intentionally
unaltered and the change of the codec is not indicated. Instead, after placing
the transcoded voice payload, the remaining free space is filled with hidden
data. TranSteg proof of concept implementation was designed and developed. The
obtained experimental results are enclosed in this paper. They prove that the
proposed method is feasible and offers a high steganographic bandwidth.
TranSteg detection is difficult to perform when performing inspection in a
single network localisation.

correlated c-axis pinning of BZO nanorods becomes progressively less obvious at
lower temperature. Indeed at 4.2 K and fields up to 31 T, the only correlated
pinning is for fields parallel to the film plane. We interpret the change as
being due to significant contributions from dense but weak pins that thermal

fields has been attributed to the favorable topology of the underlying control
landscape, where the landscape is the physical observable as a function of the
controls. The control landscape can be shown to contain no suboptimal trapping
extrema upon satisfaction of reasonable physical assumptions, but this
topological analysis does not hold when significant constraints are placed on
the control resources. This work employs simulations to explore the topology
and features of the control landscape for pure-state population transfer with a
constrained class of control fields. The fields are parameterized in terms of a
set of uniformly spaced spectral frequencies, with the associated phases acting
as the controls. Optimization results reveal that the minimum number of phase
controls necessary to assure a high yield in the target state has a special
dependence on the number of accessible energy levels in the quantum system,
revealed from an analysis of the first- and second-order variation of the yield
with respect to the controls. When an insufficient number of controls and/or a
weak control fluence are employed, trapping extrema and saddle points are
observed on the landscape. When the control resources are sufficiently
flexible, solutions producing the globally maximal yield are found to form
connected `level sets' of continuously variable control fields that preserve
the yield. These optimal yield level sets are found to shrink to isolated
points on the top of the landscape as the control field fluence is decreased,
and further reduction of the fluence turns these points into suboptimal
trapping extrema on the landscape. Although constrained control fields can come
in many forms beyond the cases explored here, the behavior found in this paper
is illustrative of the impacts that constraints can introduce.

necessarily be broken, rendering dark matter unstable. We study singlet,
doublet and triplet SU(2) multiplets of both scalar and fermion dark matter
candidates and enumerate the conditions under which no d < 6 dark matter decay
operators are generated even in the case if the flavor symmetry is broken to
nothing. We show that the VEVs of flavon scalars transforming as higher
multiplets (e.g. triplets) of the flavor group must be at the electroweak
scale. The most economical way for that is to use SM Higgs boson(s) as flavons.
Such models can be tested by the LHC experiments. This scenario requires the
existence of additional Froggatt-Nielsen scalars that generate hierarchies in
Yukawa couplings. We study the conditions under which large and small flavor

in random constraint satisfaction problems ('CSPs') mostly derive from the

these methods do not quite yield matching upper and lower bounds. According to
deep but non-rigorous arguments from statistical mechanics, this discrepancy is
due to a change in the geometry of the set of solutions called condensation
that occurs shortly before the actual threshold for the existence of solutions
(Krzakala, Montanari, Ricci-Tersenghi, Semerjian, Zdeborova: PNAS 2007). To
cope with condensation, physicists have developed a sophisticated but
non-rigorous formalism called Survey Propagation (Mezard, Parisi, Zecchina:

values of many random CSPs. Here we develop a new Survey Propagation inspired
second moment method for the random k-NAESAT problem, which is one of the
standard benchmark problems in the theory of random CSPs. This new technique
allows us to overcome the barrier posed by condensation rigorously. We prove
that the threshold for the existence of solutions in random $k$-NAESAT is
$2^{k-1}\ln2-(\frac{\ln2}2+\frac14)+\eps_k$, where $|\eps_k| \le

globular clusters (GCs) in high-energy (HE) gamma-rays. Their spectral
properties and energetics are consistent with cumulative emission from a
population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) hosted by these clusters. For example,
the HE spectra exhibit fairly hard power-law indices and cutoffs around a few
GeV, typical of pulsed spectra measured for the gamma-ray pulsar population.
The energetics may be used to constrain the number of visible MSPs in the
cluster (N_vis), assuming canonical values for the average gamma-ray efficiency
and spin-down power. This interpretation is indeed strengthened by the fact
that the first gamma-ray MSP has now been identified in the GC NGC 6624, and
this MSP is responsible for almost all of the HE emission from this cluster. On
the other hand, it has been argued that the MSPs are also sources of
relativistic leptons which may be reaccelerated in shocks originating in
collisions of stellar winds in the cluster core, and may upscatter bright
starlight and cosmic microwave background photons to very high energies.
Therefore, this unpulsed component may give an independent constraint on the
total number of MSPs (N_tot) hosted in the GC, for a given cluster magnetic
field B and diffusion coefficient k_0. Lastly, the transport properties of the
energetic leptons may be further constrained using multiwavelength data, e.g.,
to infer the radial dependence of k_0 and B. We present results on our modeling

intensity for the nano sample compared to the bulk sample was observed. This is
indicative of ferromagnetism from a small fraction of the sample. Another major
finding is that the recovery of the 119Sn longitudinal nuclear magnetization in

bulk which is exponential. Further, the 119Sn 1/T1 at room temperature is found
to be much higher for the nano sample than for its bulk counterpart. These

telescope, which lowered the trigger threshold from 55 GeV to 25 GeV and led to
the detection of pulsed gamma radiation from the Crab pulsar. To eliminate the
need for manual tuning and maintenance demanded by that first prototype, a new
setup with fully automatic calibration was designed recently. The key element
of the new circuit is a novel, continuously variable analog delay line that
enables the temporal equalization of the signals from the camera photo sensors,
which is crucial for the efficient detection of low-energy showers. A further
improvement is the much larger trigger area consisting of a fully revised
configuration of overlapping summing patches. The new system will be installed
on both telescopes, MAGIC I and II, enabling stereo observation in Sum-Trigger
mode. This will significantly improve the sensitivity in the very low energy
regime of 20 to 100 GeV, which is essential in particular for detailed pulsar
studies, as well as the observation of high-redshift AGNs and distant GRB
events. Here we like to present the results of functionality tests of a fully

near the jamming trasition is numerically investigated. It is found that the
plateau of the mean square displacement of tracer particles and the pressure

depends on the protocol to prepare the system, while the values of the critical
exponents which are consistent with the prediction of a phenomenology are
independent of the protocol.

For
example, in astrophysics, periodic variable stars play a pivotal role in
understanding our universe. An important step when analyzing data from such
processes is the problem of identifying the period: estimating the period of a
periodic function based on noisy observations made at irregularly spaced time
points. This problem is still a difficult challenge despite extensive study in
different disciplines. The paper makes several contributions toward solving
this problem. First, we present a nonparametric Bayesian model for period
finding, based on Gaussian Processes (GP), that does not make strong
assumptions on the shape of the periodic function. As our experiments
demonstrate, the new model leads to significantly better results in period
estimation when the target function is non-sinusoidal. Second, we develop a new
algorithm for parameter optimization for GP which is useful when the likelihood
function is very sensitive to the setting of the hyper-parameters with numerous
local minima, as in the case of period estimation. The algorithm combines
gradient optimization with grid search and incorporates several mechanisms to
overcome the high complexity of inference with GP. Third, we develop a novel
approach for using domain knowledge, in the form of a probabilistic generative
model, and incorporate it into the period estimation algorithm. Experimental
results on astrophysics data validate our approach showing significant
improvement over the state of the art in this domain.

to the phonon Hall effect. A general formula of the intrinsic phonon Hall
conductivity is obtained by using the corrected Kubo formula with the energy
magnetization contribution incorporated properly. The resulting phonon Hall
conductivity is fully determined by the phonon Berry curvature and the
dispersions. Based on the formula, the topological phonon system could be
rigorously defined. In the low temperature regime, we predict that the phonon
Hall conductivity is proportional to $T^{3}$ for the ordinary phonon systems,
while that for the topological phonon systems has the linear $T$ dependence
with the quantized temperature coefficient.
