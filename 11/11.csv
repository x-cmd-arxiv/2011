reviewed. The energy spectrum, mass composition, and anisotropy in arrival
directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays are discussed. The energy spectrum
of cosmic rays with energies above $10^{18}$ eV is determined using the data of
the fluorescence detectors, surface detectors, and with a hybrid shower
reconstruction technique using the both data. The ankle structure is clearly
found at $10^{18.7}$ eV. The second bending point is also identified, at which
the flux of cosmic rays begins to decrease and the spectral index changes from
$E^{-2.68}$ to $E^{-4.2}$. The study of shower development using the
fluorescence detector data shows that proton is dominant in cosmic rays above
$10^{18.2}$ eV. No apparent anisotropies in the arrival direction of cosmic
rays are found. I also present further experimental extensions which are being
developed at the Telescope Array site.

as a core-collapse supernova (SN). SN 1987A and other similar objects exhibit
properties that distinguish them from ordinary Type II Plateau (IIP) SNe, whose
progenitors are believed to be red supergiants (RSGs). Similarities among
1987A-like events include a long rise to maximum, early luminosity fainter than
that of normal Type IIP SNe, and radioactivity acting as the primary source
powering the light curves. We present and analyze two SNe monitored by the
Carnegie Supernova Project that are reminiscent of SN 1987A. Optical and
near-infrared (NIR) light curves, and optical spectroscopy of SNe 2006V and
2006au are presented. These observations are compared to those of SN 1987A, and
are used to estimate properties of their progenitors. Both objects exhibit a
slow rise to maximum and light curve evolution similar to that of SN 1987A. At
the earliest epochs, SN 2006au also displays an initial dip which we interpret
as the signature of the adiabatic cooling phase that ensues shock break- out.
SNe 2006V and 2006au are both found to be bluer, hotter and brighter than SN
1987A. Spectra of SNe 2006V and 2006au are similar to those of SN 1987A and
other normal Type II objects, although both consistently exhibit expansion
velocities higher than SN 1987A. Semi-analytic models are fit to the UVOIR
light curve of each object from which physical properties of the progenitors
are estimated. This yields ejecta mass estimates of about 20 solar masses,
explosion energies of 2 - 3 x 10^51 erg, and progenitor radii of 75 - 100 solar
radii for both SNe. The progenitors of SNe 2006V and 2006au were most likely
BSGs with a larger explosion energy as compared to that of SN 1987A.

evaluated by using the fact that subhorizon modes evolve adiabatically and
superhorizon modes are frozen. The vacuum energy density is verified to obey a
new first order differential equation depending on a dimensionless parameter of
order unity, which calibrates subhorizon/superhorizon division. We check the
validity of the approximation by calculating the corresponding vacuum energy
densities in fixed backgrounds, which are shown to agree with the known results
in de Sitter space and space-times undergoing power law expansions. We then
apply our findings to slow-roll inflationary models. Although backreaction

have been too small to fully explore this potential, however the recently
identified large and relatively homogenous sample of PCEBs from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has significantly changed this situation. We here
analyze the orbital period distributions of PCEBs containing He- and C/O-core
WDs separately and investigate whether the orbital period of PCEBs is related
to the masses of their stellar components. We performed standard statistical
tests to compare the orbital period distributions and to determine the
confidence levels of possible relations. The orbital periods of PCEBs
containing He-core WDs are significantly shorter than those of PCEBs containing
C/O-core WDs. While the He-core PCEB orbital period distribution has a median
value of Porb ~ 0.28 d, the median orbital period for PCEBs containing C/O-core
WDs is Porb ~ 0.57 d. We also find that systems containing more massive
secondaries have longer post-CE orbital periods, in contradiction to recent
predictions. Our observational results provide new constraints on theories of
CE evolution. However we suggest future binary population models to take
selection effects into account that still affect the current observed PCEB
sample.

structure in cosmology, known as the Zeldovich approximation, is equivalent to
the three-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation for potential flow. For smooth
initial data and sufficiently short times it has the property that the mapping
of the positions of fluid particles at any time $t_1$ to their positions at any

omni-potentiality. Are there other flows with this property, that are not
straightforward generalizations of Zeldovich flows? This is answered in the
affirmative in both two and three dimensions. How general are such flows? Using
a WKB technique we show that in two dimensions, for sufficiently short times,
there are omni-potential flows with arbitrary smooth initial velocity. Mappings
with a convex potential are known to be associated with the quadratic-cost
optimal transport problem. This has important implications for the problem of
reconstructing the dynamical history of the Universe from the knowledge of the

of length L adsorbed on a fluid membrane is calculated analytically at short
separations d<<L. The rods are modeled as constraints imposed on the membrane
curvature along a straight line. This allows to define four types of rods,
according to whether the membrane can twist along the rod and/or curve across
it. For stiff constraints, all the interaction potentials between the different
types of rods are attractive and proportional to L/d. Two of the four types of
rods are then equivalent, which yields six universal Casimir amplitudes.
Repulsion can occur between different rods for soft constraints. Numerical
results obtained for all ranges of d/L show that the attraction potential
reaches kT for d/L\simeq0.2. At separations smaller than d_c \approx

the mass of the system and the resolution with which it is simulated. Using
this study to anticipate the emergent behaviour at arbitrarily high resolution,
we motivate more comprehensive analytic model which allows for the range of
velocities with which the gas may exit the system, and incorporates both
momentum and energy-based constraints on the outflow. Using a trial exit
velocity distribution, this is shown to be compatible with the observed baryon
fractions in intermediate-mass systems, but implies that current estimates for
low-mass systems can not be solely accounted for by supernova winds under
commonly-held assumptions.

content remains constant. This motivated researchers to provide Web
personalized online services such as Web recommendations to alleviate the
information overload problem and provide tailored Web experiences to the Web
users. Recent studies show that Web usage mining has emerged as a popular
approach in providing Web personalization. However conventional Web usage based
recommender systems are limited in their ability to use the domain knowledge of
the Web application. The focus is only on Web usage data. As a consequence the
quality of the discovered patterns is low. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework integrating semantic information in the Web usage mining process.
Sequential Pattern Mining technique is applied over the semantic space to
discover the frequent sequential patterns. The frequent navigational patterns
are extracted in the form of Ontology instances instead of Web page views and
the resultant semantic patterns are used for generating Web page
recommendations to the user. Experimental results shown are promising and
proved that incorporating semantic information into Web usage mining process
can provide us with more interesting patterns which consequently make the
recommendation system more functional, smarter and comprehensive.

habitat quality. They can be seen as graphs, where vertices represent the
patches, and the weighted oriented edges give the probability of dispersal from
one patch to another. We consider either finite or source-transitive graphs,
i.e., graphs that are identical when viewed from a(ny) source. We assume
stochastic, individual-based, density-independent reproduction and dispersal.
By studying the path of a single random disperser, we are able to display
simple criteria for persistence, either necessary and sufficient, or just
sufficient. In case of persistence, we characterize the growth rate of the
population as well as the asymptotic occupancy frequencies of the line of
ascent of a random survivor. Our method allows to decouple the roles of
reproduction and dispersal. Finally, we extend our results to the case of
periodic or random environments, where some habitats can have variable growth
rates, autocorrelated in space and possibly in time. In the whole manuscript,
special attention is given to the example of regular graphs where each pair of
adjacent sources is separated by the same number of identical sinks. In the
case of a periodic and random environment, we also display examples where all
patches are sinks when forbidding dispersal but the metapopulation survives
with positive probability in the presence of dispersal, as previously known for
a two-patch mean-field model with parent-independent dispersal.

callibrate this scale with the equivalent feature in the Cosmic Microwave

that error ellipses for line of sight and tangential distortion parameters
shrink by a factor of two for a 20(Gpc/h)^3 `DESpec/BigBOSS'-like galaxy survey

but the low excitation molecular lines are also affected. This has serious
implications for attempts to derive the disc gas mass from line observations.
We derive fractional PAH abundances between 0.007 and 0.04 relative to ISM
levels. Using a stellar and UV excess input spectrum based on a detailed
analysis of observations, we find that the all observations are consistent with
the previously assumed disc geometry.

demonstrate that quasiparticle scattering off impurities does not capture the

addressing the dark energy challenge in the next decade. We explore in detail
the effect of allowing for small amplitude admixtures of general isocurvature
perturbations in addition to the dominant adiabatic mode. We find that
non-adiabatic initial conditions leave the sound speed unchanged but instead
excite different harmonics. These harmonics couple differently to Silk damping,
altering the form and evolution of acoustic waves in the baryon-photon fluid
prior to decoupling. This modifies not only the scale on which the sound waves
imprint onto the baryon distribution, which is used as the standard ruler in
BAO surveys, but also the shape, width and height of the BAO peak. We discuss
these effects in detail and show how more general initial conditions impact our
interpretation of cosmological data in dark energy studies. We find that the
inclusion of these additional isocurvature modes leads to an increase in the
Dark Energy Task Force Figure of merit by 140% and 60% for the BOSS and ADEPT
experiments respectively when considered in conjunction with Planck data. We
also show that the incorrect assumption of adiabaticity has the potential to
bias our estimates of the dark energy parameters by $3\sigma$ ($1\sigma$) for a
single correlated isocurvature mode, and up to $8\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) for three
correlated isocurvature modes in the case of the BOSS (ADEPT) experiment. We
find that the use of the large scale structure data in conjunction with CMB
data improves our ability to measure the contributions of different modes to
the initial conditions by as much as 100% for certain modes in the fully
correlated case.

have attracted considerable recent attention due to their computational

incorporating such approximate message passing (AMP) methods in general
graphical models. The key concept is a partition of dependencies of a general
graphical model into strong and weak edges, with the weak edges representing
interactions through aggregates of small, linearizable couplings of variables.
AMP approximations based on the Central Limit Theorem can be readily applied to
aggregates of many weak edges and integrated with standard message passing
updates on the strong edges. The resulting algorithm, which we call hybrid
generalized approximate message passing (HyGAMP), can yield significantly
simpler implementations of sum-product and max-sum loopy belief propagation. By
varying the partition of strong and weak edges, a performance--complexity
trade-off can be achieved. Group sparsity and multinomial logistic regression
problems are studied as examples of the proposed methodology.

suggesting that star formation is rapid. However, small numbers of stars in
these regions with inferred ages of >= 5-10 Myr have been cited to argue that
star formation is instead a slow, quasi-static process. When considering these
alternative pictures it is important to recognize that the age spread in a
given star-forming cloud is necessarily an upper limit to the timescales of
local collapse, as not all spatially-distinct regions will start contracting at
precisely the same instant. Moreover, star-forming clouds may dynamically
evolve on timescales of a few Myr; in particular, global gravitational
contraction will tend to yield increasing star formation rates with time due to
generally increasing local gas densities. We show that two different numerical
simulations of dynamic, flow-driven molecular cloud formation and evolution 1)
predict age spreads for the main stellar population roughly consistent with
observations, and 2) raise the possibility of forming small numbers of stars
early in cloud evolution, before global contraction concentrates the gas and
the bulk of the stellar population is produced. In general, the existence of a
small number of older stars among a generally much-younger population is
consistent with the picture of dynamic star formation, and may even provide
clues to the time evolution of star-forming clouds.

Pnictide with ""half-Dirac"" node under magnetic field in vortex state. By
computing the density of states, we aim to find in vortex state the form of
non-Simon-Lee scaling predicted for such system by several recent works in
non-vortex state. We find by exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Genne
Hamiltonian and finite size scaling a $N(E)\sim \sqrt{E}$ power law in the case
without magnetic field which agrees with analytical prediction. We consider the
vortex state by first studying the hypothetical situation of uniform magnetic
field without vortices and then we properly treat the magnetic field-induced
vortex lattice by expressing the BdG Hamiltonian in terms of superfluid
velocity and Berry's gauge fields. The two calculations are shown to agree with
each other. We then analyze quantitatively, the effects of anisotropic
dispersion to the scaling properties of vortex lattice and show that the vortex
lattice spacings will scale as $d'_y\sim s^{-\eta}d'_x $ where $1/2\leq
\eta\leq1$ and $s\sim H^2/3$ as compared to $\eta=1/2$ from dimensional scaling
analysis of non-vortex state. A very crucial prediction is also made on an
upper bound to the value of 'anomalous dimension' $\delta$ of density of states
scaling with magnetic field which we find to be $\delta\leq1/2$, a quantity
that could not be determined conclusively by previous purely analytical works
and a quantity that can be measured experimentally.

We complemented our observations with radio continuum archived data from the

Ammonia emission was found mainly in three clumps located at the south and east
of the position of the compact infrared cluster of AFGL 437, where the CO
outflow seemed to have its origin. One of the NH3(1,1) clumps coincides with
the maximum of NH3(2,2) and with a local peak of emission at 450 {\mu}m. A near
infrared source (s11) is also found at that position. Our continuum map at 2 cm
shows extended elongated emission associated with the infrared source AFGL
437W. This elongated morphology and its spectral index between 3.6 and 2 cm

several molecular bipolar outflows may exist in the region. The observed CO
outflow would be the superposition of those individual outflows, which would

stronger gravity, there are far more massive halos and large voids in f(R)

mammography. As a large fraction of the population will be exposed to
radiation, low-dose imaging is essential. Iterative image reconstruction based
on solving an optimization problem, such as Total-Variation minimization, shows
potential for reconstruction from sparse-view data. For iterative methods it is
important to ensure convergence to an accurate solution, since important image
features, such as presence of microcalcifications indicating breast cancer, may
not be visible in a non-converged reconstruction, and this can have clinical
significance. To prevent excessively long computational times, which is a
practical concern for the large image arrays in CT, it is desirable to keep the
number of iterations low, while still ensuring a sufficiently accurate
reconstruction for the specific imaging task. This motivates the study of
accurate convergence criteria for iterative image reconstruction. In simulation
studies with a realistic breast phantom with microcalcifications we compare
different convergence criteria for reliable reconstruction. Our results show
that it can be challenging to ensure a sufficiently accurate microcalcification
reconstruction, when using standard convergence criteria. In particular, the
gray level of the small microcalcifications may not have converged long after
the background tissue is reconstructed uniformly. We propose the use of the
individual objective function gradient components to better monitor possible
regions of non-converged variables. For microcalcifications we find empirically
a large correlation between nonzero gradient components and non-converged
variables, which occur precisely within the microcalcifications. This supports
our claim that gradient components can be used to ensure convergence to a
sufficiently accurate reconstruction.

the limited attenuation between the relay's transmit and receive antenna
arrays, the relay's outgoing signal may overwhelm its limited-dynamic-range

desired incoming signal. While explicitly modeling transmitter/receiver
dynamic-range limitations and channel estimation error, we derive tight upper
and lower bounds on the end-to-end achievable rate of decode-and-forward-based
full-duplex MIMO relay systems, and propose a transmission scheme based on
maximization of the lower bound. The maximization requires us to (numerically)
solve a nonconvex optimization problem, for which we detail a novel approach
based on bisection search and gradient projection. To gain insights into system
design tradeoffs, we also derive an analytic approximation to the achievable
rate and numerically demonstrate its accuracy. We then study the behavior of
the achievable rate as a function of signal-to-noise ratio,
interference-to-noise ratio, transmitter/receiver dynamic range, number of

building area network and neighboring area network in such a way that the
privacy of customers is protected. We use homomorphic encryption technique to
achieve this. The consumer data that is collected is sent to the substations
where it is monitored by remote terminal units (RTU). The proposed access
control mechanism gives selective access to consumer data stored in data
repositories and used by different smart grid users. Users can be maintenance
units, utility centers, pricing estimator units or analyzing and prediction
groups. We solve this problem of access control using cryptographic technique
of attribute-based encryption. RTUs and users have attributes and cryptographic
keys distributed by several key distribution centers (KDC). RTUs send data
encrypted under a set of attributes. Users can decrypt information provided
they have valid attributes. The access control scheme is distributed in nature
and does not rely on a single KDC to distribute keys. Bobba \emph{et al.}
\cite{BKAA09} proposed an access control scheme, which relies on a centralized
KDC and is thus prone to single-point failure. The other requirement is that
the KDC has to be online, during data transfer which is not required in our
scheme. Our access control scheme is collusion resistant, meaning that users
cannot collude and gain access to data, when they are not authorized to access.
We theoretically analyze our schemes and show that the computation overheads
are low enough to be carried out in smart grids. To the best of our knowledge,
ours is the first work on smart grids, which integrates these two important
security components (privacy preserving data aggregation and access control)

mass stars. At 15.3 pc, the minimal astrometric amplitude for planet candidate
GJ 317b is 0.3 milliarcseconds (edge-on orbit), just below our astrometric

candidate, with a period of 20 years or more. Even though such an object will
imprint a large astrometric wobble on the star, its curvature is yet not
evident in the astrometry. Given high metallicity, and the trend indicating

their proper function. We examine a common scenario in which only participants
that are aware of the information can compete for some reward, and thus
informed participants have an incentive not to propagate information to others.
One recent example in which such tension arises is the 2009 DARPA Network
Challenge (finding red balloons). We focus on another prominent example:
Bitcoin, a decentralized electronic currency system.
  Bitcoin represents a radical new approach to monetary systems. It has been
getting a large amount of public attention over the last year, both in policy
discussions and in the popular press. Its cryptographic fundamentals have
largely held up even as its usage has become increasingly widespread. We find,
however, that it exhibits a fundamental problem of a different nature, based on
how its incentives are structured. We propose a modification to the protocol
that can eliminate this problem.
  Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network to track transactions that are
performed with the currency. For this purpose, every transaction a node learns
about should be transmitted to its neighbors in the network. The current
implemented protocol provides an incentive to nodes to not broadcast
transactions they are aware of. Our solution is to augment the protocol with a
scheme that rewards information propagation. Since clones are easy to create in
the Bitcoin system, an important feature of our scheme is Sybil-proofness.
  We show that our proposed scheme succeeds in setting the correct incentives,
that it is Sybil-proof, and that it requires only a small payment overhead, all
this is achieved with iterated elimination of dominated strategies. We
complement this result by showing that there are no reward schemes in which
information propagation and no self-cloning is a dominant strategy.

atmosphere, or a planet with a composition dominated by water. In the case of a
hydrogen-rich atmosphere, molecular absorption and scattering processes may
result in detectable radius variations as a function of wavelength. The aim of
this paper is to measure these variations. We have obtained observations of the
transit of GJ1214b in the r- and I-band with the INT, in the g, r, i and z
bands with the 2.2 meter MPI/ESO telescope, in the Ks-band with the NOT, and in
the Kc-band with the WHT. By comparing the transit depth between the the
different bands, which is a measure for the planet-to-star size ratio, the
atmosphere is investigated. We do not detect clearly significant variations in
the planet-to-star size ratio as function of wavelength. Although the ratio at
the shortest measured wavelength, in g-band, is 2sigma larger than in the other
bands. The uncertainties in the Ks and Kc bands are large, due to systematic
features in the light curves. The tentative increase in the planet-to-star size
ratio at the shortest wavelength could be a sign of an increase in the
effective planet-size due to Rayleigh scattering, which would require GJ1214b
to have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. If true, then the atmosphere has to have
both clouds, to suppress planet-size variations at red optical wavelengths, as
well as a sub-solar metallicity, to suppress strong molecular features in the
near- and mid-infrared. However, star spots, which are known to be present on
the hoststar's surface, can (partly) cancel out the expected variations in
planet-to-star size ratio, due to the lower surface temperature of the spots .
A hypothetical spot-fraction of 10% would be able to raise the infrared points
sufficiently with respect to the optical measurements to be inconsistent with a
water-dominated atmosphere. [abridged]

realistic values of device parameters. Besides a marked dependence of the
thermopower on the superconducting gap $\Delta$ we observe an enhancement in
the parity regime which is accompanied by a dramatic increase of the
thermoelectric figure of merit ZT. The latter can be explained within a simple
re-interpretation of ZT in terms of averages and variances of transport
energies.

one of which we identify as a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star, as well as an A-type
supergiant. The line-of-sight extinction is very large, $A_{V}\sim 45$,
illustrating the challenges of locating young star clusters in the Galactic

of 3.7$^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$\,Myr, and, assuming that all emission-line stars are
WRs, a cluster mass of $\ga 10^4$\msun. A kinematic analysis of the cluster's
surrounding HII-region shows that the cluster is located in the Galactic disk
at a distance of 11$\pm$2\,kpc. This places the cluster close to where the far
end of the Bar intersects the Norma spiral arm. This cluster, as well as the
nearby cluster [DBS2003]179, represent the first detections of active star
cluster formation at this side of the Bar, in contrast to the near side which

fermions, we investigate whether there are any ambiguities in the expression
for the pion mass resulting from multiple chiral symmetries. The concern is
that, calculating the conserved current for Ginsparg Wilson chiral symmetries
in the usual way, different expressions of the chiral symmetries lead to
different currents. This implies an ambiguity in the definition of the pion and
pion decay constant for all Ginsparg-Wilson expressions of the Dirac operator,
including the overlap operator. We use a renormalisation group mapping
procedure to consider local chiral symmetry transformations for a continuum
Ginsparg-Wilson ""Dirac-operator."" We find that this naturally leads to an
expression for the conserved current that differs from the standard expression
by cut-off artefacts, but is independent of which of the Ginsparg-Wilson
symmetries is chosen. We recover the standard expressions for the massive Dirac
operator, propagator, and chiral condensate. With this in place, we proceed to
calculate the pion mass in the mapped theory as a function of the quark mass,
and discover a unique expression for $F_\pi$ and $m_\pi$, recovering the usual
Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation, baring the substitution of the chiral
condensate with its modified value. We hypothesise that the argument can be

both the channels from SU-TX to SU-RX, denoted as $g_1$ and the channel from

regions in the vector channel space is shown to have a 'stepwise' structure.
With this structure, the above outage minimization problem can be explicitly
formulated and solved by employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) necessary
optimality conditions to obtain a locally optimal quantized power codebook. A
low-complexity near-optimal quantized power allocation algorithm is derived for
the case of large number of feedback bits. An explicit expression for the

the optimal outage behavior extremely well for large number of bits of feedback

of feedback, the derived algorithms provide SU outage performance very close to

We find most of its ground states. This is a complicated problem of energy
minimization, with three quantum variables under constraints, i.e. the total
spin of each species and the total spin of the whole mixture, as well as four
parameters, including intraspecies and interspecies spin coupling strengths and
the magnetic field. The quantum phase diagram is very rich. Compared with the
case without a magnetic field, the ground states are modified by a magnetic
field, which also modifies the ground state boundaries or introduces new
crossover regimes on the phase diagram. Without interspecies spin coupling, the
quantum phase transitions existing in absence of a magnetic field disappear
when a magnetic field is applied, which leads to crossover regimes in the phase
diagram. Under ferromagnetic interspecies spin coupling, the ground states
remain disentangled no matter whether there is a magnetic field. For
antiferromagnetic interspecies spin coupling, a magnetic field entangles the
ground states in some parameter regimes. When the intraspecies spin couplings
are both ferromagnetic, the quantum phase transition between antiferromagnetic
and zero interspecies spin couplings survives the magnetic field. When the
intraspecies spin couplings are both antiferromagnetic, a magnetic field
induces new quantum phase transitions between antiferromagnetic and zero

Indirect Service Provision for variety absorption and co-creating emotional
value and customer experience and (c) designing direct and indirect provision

complex multidimensional value could be delivered through different value

to understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of the firm in
co-creating value as a major issue in the design of complex socio-technical
systems. Goods are often designed within the domain of engineering and product
design, often placing human activity as a supporting role to the equipment.
Through an SDLogic lens, this study considers the design of both equipment and
human activity on an equal footing for value co-creation with the customer, and
it yielded interesting results on when direct provisioning (goods) should be
redesigned, considering all activities equally.

optimized for the assembly of individual s-SWNT, 97% of the devices show FET
behavior with a maximum mobility of 210 cm2/Vs, on-off current ratio ~ 106 and
on conductance up to 3 {\mu}S, however with an assembly yield of only 33%. As
the DEP parameters were optimized so that 1-5 s-SWNTs are connected per
electrode pair, the assembly yield was almost 90% with ~ 90% of these assembled
devices demonstrating FET behavior. Further optimization gives an assembly
yield of 100% with up to 10 SWNT/site, however with a reduced FET yield of 59%.
Improved FET performance including higher current on-off ratio and high

current induced in a superconducting loop by the rotation of a frame to which
it is attached. The frame experiences a torque caused by a GW propagating
perpendicular to it because it is made of materials of different density in
adjacent quadrants. Superconducting Cooper pair system responds symmetrically
to the wave and stays at rest, while the ions of the superconductor are being
accelerated by the moving frame. This generates an electric current in the loop
which can be measured precisely by sensitive electronics. For that task the
antenna consists of two superconducting loops parallel to each other. One of
them, the primary loop, rotationally oscillates because of the described
reasons, while the second stays at rest. In the oscillating loop the current
creates an oscillating magnetic flux. This flux should be compensated due to
fluxoid quantization, by the oppositely directed current in the non-moving,
secondary loop, in which the ions are at rest, and the Cooper pairs move. We
estimate the resulting signal/noise ratio and discuss the signal detectability.
Several designs are envisioned, both for terrestrial and for orbital
arrangements of the antenna.

Any pair of neighboring photonic qubits are coupled via a mediator charge
qubit, and large photonic cluster states can be created by applying
Stark-shifted Rabi pulses to these mediator qubits. The distinct advantage of
our architecture is that it combines both the excellent scalability of the
solid-state systems and the long coherence time of the photonic qubits.
Furthermore, this architecture is very robust against the parameter variations.

microwave absorption in He-II (superfluid He) in the presence of varying

cannot be explained in terms of conventional microscopic theory (CMT) of He-II
which presumes the existence of p = 0 condensate and concludes that He atoms
even at T = 0 have random motions and mutual collisions which do not support
the basic factor (viz. an ordered arrangement of atomic electric dipoles)
needed for its occurrence. (ii) The desired order is concluded, rather, by a
non-conventional microscopic theory (NCMT) as an intrinsic property of He-II.
Accordingly, all atoms in He-II define a closepacked arrangement of their wave
packets (CPA-WP) with identically equal nearest neighbour distance (d), per
particle zero-point energy ({\epsilon}0 = h2/8md2) and equivalent momentum,
h/2d. (iii) The CPA-WP prevent atoms from having relative motions and mutual
collisions capable of disturbing any order of atomic dipoles. As such the NCMT
and the observed Stark effect have strong mutual support; whereas the former
concludes CPA-WP necessary for the occurrence of the effect, the latter
strengthens the experimental support for the former, which means that
theobservation does not support the presence of p = 0 condensate in He-II.

the glasso, a regularized covariance matrix estimate a sparse inverse
covariance matrix estimate, not only identify a graphical model but can also
serve as intermediate inputs into multivariate procedures such as PCA, LDA,
MANOVA, and others. The glasso indeed produces a covariance matrix estimate
which solves the L1 penalized optimization problem in a dual sense; however,
the method for producing the inverse covariance matrix estimator after this
optimization is inexact and may produce asymmetric estimates. This problem is
exacerbated when the amount of L1 regularization that is applied is small,
which in turn is more likely to occur if the true underlying inverse covariance
matrix is not sparse. The lack of symmetry can potentially have consequences.
First, it implies that the covariance and inverse covariance estimates are not
numerical inverses of one another, and second, asymmetry can possibly lead to
negative or complex eigenvalues,rendering many multivariate procedures which

spin and charge ordering phenomena in underdoped cuprates. These range from
early work on stripe correlations in Nd-LSCO to the latest discovery of
charge-density-waves in YBCO. Both phenomena are characterized by a pronounced
dependence on doping, temperature, and an externally applied magnetic field.
Here we show that these electron-lattice instabilities exhibit also a
previously unrecognized bulk-surface dichotomy. Surface-sensitive electronic
and structural probes uncover a temperature-dependent evolution of the CuO2
plane band dispersion and apparent Fermi pockets in underdoped Bi2201, which is
directly associated with an hitherto-undetected strong temperature dependence
of the incommensurate superstructure periodicity below 130K. In stark contrast,
the structural modulation revealed by bulk-sensitive probes is temperature
independent. These findings point to a surface-enhanced incipient
charge-density-wave instability, driven by Fermi surface nesting. This
discovery is of critical importance in the interpretation of single-particle
spectroscopy data and establishes the surface of cuprates and other complex
oxides as a rich playground for the study of electronically soft phases.

obtained for extreme structural models in earlier attempts are reviewed using a
new formalism in terms of deviation (matrix) traces which, for homoscedastic
data, reduce to usual quantities leaving aside an unessential (but dimensional)
multiplicative factor. Within the framework of classical error models, the
dependent variable relates to the independent variable according to the usual
additive model. The classes of linear models considered are regression lines in
the limit of uncorrelated errors in X and in Y. For homoscedastic data, the
results are taken from earlier attempts and rewritten using a more compact
notation. For heteroscedastic data, the results are inferred from a procedure
related to functional models. An example of astronomical application is
considered, concerning the [O/H]-[Fe/H] empirical relations deduced from five
samples related to different stars and/or different methods of oxygen abundance
determination. For low-dispersion samples and assigned methods, different
regression models yield results which are in agreement within the errors for
both heteroscedastic and homoscedastic data, while the contrary holds for
large-dispersion samples. In any case, samples related to different methods
produce discrepant results, due to the presence of (still undetected)
systematic errors, which implies no definitive statement can be made at
present. Asymptotic expressions approximate regression line slope and intercept
variance estimators, for normal residuals, to a better extent with respect to
earlier attempts. Related fractional discrepancies are not exceeding a few
percent for low-dispersion data, which grows up to about 10% for
large-dispersion data. An extension of the formalism to generic structural
models is left to a forthcoming paper.

significant correlation between the ratio of rotational velocity to central
velocity dispersion (V_{rot}/sigma_0) and the Horizontal Branch Morphology

exhibits the same period as the orbit (phase \Phi) and a second periodicity of
1667 days (phase \Theta) which modulates the orbital phase and amplitude of the
large outburst. Recent analysis of the radio spectral index present strong
evidence for the presence of the critical transition from optically thick

first introduced in Englert et al. 2009. Fastness is measured in terms of the
number of single round read and write operations that does not sacrifice
correctness. In Georgiou et al. 2011 was shown, however, that decreasing the
communication cost is not enough in these implementations. In particular,
considering that the performance is measured in terms of the latency of read
and write operations due to both (a) communication delays and (b)local
computation, they introduced two new algorithms that traded communication for
reducing computation. As computation is still part of the algorithms, someone
may wonder: What is the trade-off between communication and local computation
in real-time systems?

atomic register implementations: SFW from Englert et al. 2009, APRX-SFW and
CWFR from Georgiou at al. 2011, and the generalization of the traditional
algorithm of Attiya et al. 1996 in the MWMR environment, which we call SIMPLE.

magnetic field. Indeed we find that for less than a critical distance there are
entanglement plateaus dependent upon the distance between the spins, whereas
above the critical distance the entanglement can exhibit sudden death.

of Nature, fostering an inherent randomness which forbids a deterministic
description; yet the most fundamental departure arises from something
different. As shown by Bell [1] and Kochen-Specker [2], quantum mechanics
portrays a picture of the world in which reality loses its objectivity and is
in fact created by observation. Quantum mechanics predicts phenomena which
cannot be explained by any theory with objective realism, although our everyday
experience supports the hypothesis that macroscopic objects, despite being made
of quantum particles, exist independently of the act of observation; in this
paper we identify this behavior as classical. Here we show that this seemingly
obvious classical behavior of the macroscopic world cannot be experimentally
tested and belongs to the realm of ontology similar to the dispute on the
interpretations of quantum mechanics [3,4]. For small systems such as a single
photon [5] or a pair [6], it has been experimentally proven that a classical
description cannot be sustained. Recently, there have also been experiments
that claim to have demonstrated quantum behavior of relatively large objects
such as interference of fullerenes [7], the violation of Leggett-Garg
inequality in Josephson junction [8], and interference between two condensed
clouds of atoms [9], which suggest that there is no limit to the size of the
system on which the quantum-versus-classical question can be tested. These
behaviors, however, are not sufficient to refute classical description in the
sense of objective reality. Our findings show that once we reach the regime
where an Avogadro number of particles is present, the quantum-versus-classical
question cannot be answered experimentally.

highly excited OH lines, and the Q branches of the organics C2H2, HCN, and CO2,
similar to the emission observed toward several T Tauri systems. The outburst
emission shows instead remarkable changes: H2O and OH line fluxes increase, new
OH, H2, and HI transitions are detected, and organics are no longer seen. We
adopt a simple model of a single-temperature slab of gas in local thermal
equilibrium, a common approach for molecular analyses of Spitzer spectra, and
derive the excitation temperature, column density, and emitting area of H2O and
OH. We show how model results strongly depend on the selection of emission
lines fitted, and that spectrally-resolved observations are essential for a
correct interpretation of the molecular emission from disks, particularly in
the case of water. Using H2O lines that can be approximated as thermalized to a
single temperature, our results are consistent with a column density decrease
in outburst while the emitting area of warm gas increases. A rotation diagram
analysis suggests that the OH emission can be explained with two temperature
components, which remarkably increase in column density in outburst. The
relative change of H2O and OH emission suggests a key role for UV radiation in
the disk surface chemistry.

($c_s<v_{b0}<1.7c_s$), one of the beam modes when coupled to the DIA mode may
become unstable. The SWs with positive (negative) potential may exist when the
difference of the nonlinear wave speed ($M$) and the beam speed is such that
$1.2\lesssim M-v_{b0}\lesssim1.6$ ($M-v_{b0}\gtrsim1.6$). Furthermore, for real
density perturbations, the wave potential $(>0)$ is found to be limited by a
critical value which typically depends on $M$, $v_{b0}$ as well as the ion/beam

their properties are analyzed numerically in terms of the system parameters.
While the system supports both the compressive and rarefactive large amplitude
SWs, the small amplitude solitons exist only of the compressive type. The
theoretical results may be useful for observation of soliton excitations in
laboratory ion-beam driven plasmas as well as in space plasmas where the

cross-polarization better than -50 dB, and far-out sidelobes below -70 dB. The
polarization purity was realized by using a symmetric low-loss dielectric foam
support structure for the secondary mirror, avoiding the need for secondary
support struts. Ground spill-over was largely reduced by using absorbing
baffles around the primary and secondary mirrors, and by the use of a
low-sidelobe profiled corrugated feedhorn. The 6.1-m antenna and receiver have
been completed and test results show that the optics meet their design goals.

to self-avoiding walks, and adding self-interaction at multiply visited sites
gives a model of polymer collapse. Recently, a two-dimensional model
(triangular lattice) where doubly and triply visited sites are given different
weights was shown to display a rich phase diagram with first and second order
collapse separated by a multi-critical point. A kinetic growth process of
trails (KGT) was conjectured to map precisely to this multi-critical point. Two
types of low temperature phases, globule and crystal-like, were encountered.
Here, we investigate the collapse properties of a similar extended model of
interacting lattice trails on the simple cubic lattice with separate weights
for doubly and triply visited sites. Again we find first and second order
collapse transitions dependent on the relative sizes of the doubly and triply
visited energies. However we find no evidence of a low temperature crystal-like
phase with only the globular phase in existence.
  Intriguingly, when the ratio of the energies is precisely that which
separates the first order from the second-order regions anomalous finite-sized
scaling appears. At the finite size location of the rounded transition clear
evidence exists for a first order transition that persists in the thermodynamic
limit. This location moves as the length increases, with its limit apparently
at the point that maps to a KGT. However, if one fixes the temperature to sit
at exactly this KGT point then only a critical point can be deduced from the
data. The resolution of this apparent contradiction lies in the breaking of
crossover scaling and the difference in the shift and transition width
(crossover) exponents.

We found that both the normalized differential ion speed, $V_{\alpha

We present a determination of the intrinsic colors and ages of galaxies
at very high redshift, in particular old galaxies (OGs) within extremely red
objects (EROs). To date, the definition of EROs has been restricted to objects
with z<2.5, however, here consider objects with the same properties but shifted
to higher redshifts (z>2.5). We therefore, refer to these objects as very
high-redshift EROs (Z-EROS, herein). Methods. We analyze 63,550 galaxies
selected in the XMM-LSS field. To obtain a reasonably sized sample of EROs, it
is essential to consider a very wide area surveys. We identify targets within
an area of 0.77 square degrees for which optical to mid-infrared data are
available from SUBARU, UKIDSS, and Spitzer. We select Z-EROs based on their
colors, and then perform a selection of only OGs. One of our novel innovations
is to adapt the traditional method of EROs selection based on the filters I and
K, to higher redshifts. Using our method, we identify 20 objects that satisfy
the conditions required to be Z-EROs/OGs at redshifts 2.5<z<3.8 within some
conservative constraints of errors in the photometric redshifts. For each of
these objects, we calculate the corresponding color at rest (B-V), and estimate
their average stellar mass and age by comparing this color with a synthesis
model. Results. Our selected galaxies have high stellar masses (~10^{11} M_sun)
and are older than 1 Gyr, hence their stellar populations were formed at
z>~4.7. After including additional galaxies with z<2.5 analyzed in a previous
paper, we find that the formation epoch depends significantly on the observed
redshift and stellar mass: the higher the stellar mass, the lower the age of
the Universe at which it was formed. This result appears to conflict with
Lambda-CDM models that claim that the most massive galaxies formed after lower
mass.

solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations $F(X, D^2u) = f(X)$, based on
weakest integrability properties of $f$ in different scenarios. The primary
result established in this work is a sharp Log-Lipschitz estimate on $u$ based
on the $L^n$ norm of $f$, which corresponds to optimal regularity bounds for
the critical threshold case. Optimal $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity estimates are
delivered when $f\in L^{n+\epsilon}$. The limiting upper borderline case, $f\in
L^\infty$, also has transcendental importance to elliptic regularity theory and
its applications. In this paper we show, under convexity assumption on $F$,
that $u \in C^{1,\mathrm{Log-Lip}}$, provided $f$ has bounded mean oscillation.
Once more, such an estimate is optimal. For the lower borderline integrability
condition allowed by the theory, we establish interior \textit{a priori}
estimates on the $C^{0,\frac{n-2\epsilon}{n-\epsilon}}$ norm of $u$ based on
the $L^{n-\epsilon}$ norm of $f$, where $\epsilon$ is the Escauriaza universal
constant. The exponent $\frac{n-2\epsilon}{n-\epsilon}$ is optimal. When the
source function $f$ lies in $L^q$, $n > q > n-\epsilon$, we also obtain the
exact, improved sharp H\""older exponent of continuity.

modeling framework and a computational theory for Kalman smoothing.
  We develop a statistical framework by establishing conditions required to
interpret PLQ penalties as negative logs of true probability densities. Then,
we present a computational framework, based on interior-point methods, that
solves the Kalman smoothing problem with PLQ penalties and maintains the linear
complexity in the size of the time series, just as in the L2 case. The
framework presented extends the computational efficiency of the Mayne-Fraser

a large-scale galactic magnetic field is irrelevant at the scale of individual
clouds, because the turbulence and rotation of a cloud may randomize the
orientation of its magnetic field. Alternatively, galactic fields could be
strong enough to impose their direction upon individual clouds, thereby
regulating cloud accumulation and fragmentation, and affecting the rate and
efficiency of star formation. Our location in the disk of the Galaxy makes an
assessment of the situation difficult. Here we report observations of the
magnetic field orientation of six giant molecular cloud complexes in the
nearby, almost face-on, galaxy M33. The fields are aligned with the spiral
arms, suggesting that the large-scale field in M33 anchors the clouds.

significantly affected by their abundance anomalies. The observed SED

However, the direct evidence for this is still only scarce. We aim to identify
the processes that determine the SED and its variability in the UV and visual
spectral domains of the helium-weak star CU Vir. We used the model atmospheres
to obtain the emergent flux and predict the rotationally modulated flux
variability of the star. We show that most of the light variations in the vby
filters of the Stromgren photometric system are a result of the uneven surface
distribution of silicon, chromium, and iron. Our models are only able to
explain a part of the variability in the u filter, however. The observed UV
flux distribution is very well reproduced, and the models are able to explain
most of the observed features in the UV light curve. The variability observed
in the visible is merely a faint gleam of that in the UV. While the amplitude
of the light curves reaches only several hundredths of magnitude in the visual
domain, it reaches about 1 mag in the UV. The visual and UV light variability
of CU Vir is caused by the flux redistribution from the far UV to near UV and
visible regions, inhomogeneous distribution of the elements and stellar
rotation. Bound-free transitions of silicon and bound-bound transitions of iron
and chromium contribute the most to the flux redistribution. This mechanism can
explain most of the rotationally modulated light variations in the filters
centred on the Paschen continuum and on the UV continuum of the star CU Vir.
However, another mechanism(s) has to be invoked to fully explain the observed
light variations in the u filter and in the region 2000-2500 A.

helical spin order. There, similar to conventional ferroelectrics, the
electrical dipoles arise from an off-centre displacement of ions. However,
recently a different mechanism, namely purely electronic ferroelectricity,
where charge order breaks inversion symmetry, has attracted considerable
interest. Here we provide evidence for this exotic type of ferroelectricity,
accompanied by antiferromagnetic spin order, in a two-dimensional organic
charge-transfer salt, thus representing a new class of multiferroics. Quite
unexpectedly for electronic ferroelectrics, dipolar and spin order arise nearly
simultaneously. This can be ascribed to the loss of spin frustration induced by
the ferroelectric ordering. Hence, here the spin order is driven by the
ferroelectricity, in marked contrast to the spin-driven ferroelectricity in
helical magnets.

present here new spatially resolved L-band integral field unit observations of
the inner kpc of the luminous IR galaxy NGC 1614. A broad ring of 3.3 um PAH
emission is found at a distance of approximately 200 pc from the core. This
ring overlaps with a previously established star-forming ring detected with
Pa_alpha and radio continuum observations, but peaks outside it, especially if
determined using the PAH equivalent width. Using the characteristics of the PAH
emission and the ionised gas emission we argue that NGC 1614 features an
outward propagating ring of star formation, where the equivalent width of the
PAH emission localises the regions where the current star formation is just
expanding into the molecular gas outward of the nucleus. The core itself shows
a highly luminous, slightly resolved (at ~80 pc) L-band continuum source. We
find no evidence of AGN activity and rule out the presence of an obscured AGN
using L-band diagnostics. Furthermore, we detect the likely companion galaxy
from archival HST/ACS imaging. The star formation and dynamical characteristics
of the system are consistent with a relatively major merger just after its
second passage. An outstanding question is how a gas-rich advanced merger such
as this one, with strong LIRG level nuclear starburst and major merger-like
tidal features, has not yet developed an active nucleus.

extent to which it retains a nested canalyzing structure. We characterize the
structure of functions with a given depth and compute the expected activities
and sensitivities of the variables. This analysis quantifies how canalyzation
leads to higher stability in Boolean networks. It generalizes the notion of
nested canalyzing functions (NCFs), which are precisely the functions with
maximum depth. NCFs have been proposed as gene regulatory network models, but
their structure is frequently too restrictive and they are extremely sparse. We
find that functions become decreasingly sensitive to input perturbations as the
canalyzing depth increases, but exhibit rapidly diminishing returns in
stability. Additionally, we show that as depth increases, the dynamics of
networks using these functions quickly approach the critical regime, suggesting
that real networks exhibit some degree of canalyzing depth, and that NCFs are
not significantly better than functions of sufficient depth for many
applications of the modeling and reverse engineering of biological networks.

(9-8) map has a 6.4 arcsec resolution, revealing a ~0.5 pc, jet-like, and
bipolar outflow. This is the first map of a molecular outflow in a THz line.
The CO (9-8) and (4-3) lines arising from the outflow lobes both show extremely
high-velocity line wings, and their ratios indicate a gas temperature greater
than 100 K and a density higher than 10^4 cm^{-3}. The spatial-velocity
structure of the CO (9-8) data is typical of a bow-shock-driven flow, which is
consistent with the association between the bipolar outflow and the infrared
bow-shaped tips. In short, the observations unveil a highly-excited and
collimated component in a bipolar outflow that is powered by a high-mass
protostar, and provide insights into the driving mechanism of the outflow.
Meanwhile, the observations demonstrate that high-quality mapping observations
can be performed with the new THz receiver on APEX.

This paper presents an optimisation of an existing system and proves that

gravity field of Earth, with the result that the neutrinos propagated (just)
luminally.

expansion scalar in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. The fluid is assumed to be
locally anisotropic which evolves adiabatically. To study the dynamics of the
collapsing fluid, Newtonian and post Newtonian regimes are taken into account.
The field equations are investigated for a well-known $f(R)$ model of the form
$R+\delta R^2$ admitting Schwarzschild solution. The perturbation scheme is
used on the dynamical equations to explore the instability conditions of
expansionfree fluid evolution. We conclude that instability conditions depend
upon pressure anisotropy, energy density and some constraints arising from this
theory.

From the arrival direction of these muons, the anisotropy in arrival direction
