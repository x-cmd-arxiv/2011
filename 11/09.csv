absorbed Seyfert galaxies hard X-ray selected with INTEGRAL. The sample is
composed of 33 sources: 15 are newly discovered above 20 keV while 18 are
already known AGN. For 17 sources we have performed a broadband analysis with
XMM and INTEGRAL data. We have complemented the analysis of the 16 remaining
sources with existing broadband studies. The spectra are well reproduced with
an absorbed primary emission with a high energy cutoff and its scattered
fraction below 2-3 keV, plus the Compton reflection features. A high energy
cut-off is found in 30% of the sample, with an average value below 150 keV. The
hard X-ray selection favours the detection of more obscured sources, with the
log NH average value of 23.15. The diagnostic plot NH vs
F(corr)(2-10keV)/F(20-100keV) allowed the isolation of the Compton thick
objects and may represent a useful tool for future hard X-ray observations of
newly discovered AGN. We are unable to associate the reflection components
(continuum and Fe line) with the absorbing gas as a torus, a more complex
scenario being necessary. In the Compton thin sources, a fraction (but not all)
of the Fe line needs to be produced in a gas located closer to the BH than the
thick torus, and this is possibly associated with the optical BLR, responsible
also for the absorption. We still need a Compton thick medium (not intercepting
the line of sight) likely associated to a torus, which contributes to the Fe
line and produces the observed reflection continuum above 10 keV. The
Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect can not be confirmed with our data. Finally, the
comparison with a sample of unobscured AGN shows that, type 1 and type 2 (once
corrected for absorption) Seyfert are characterized by the same
nuclear/accretion properties (luminosity, bolometric luminosity, Eddington
ratio), supporting the unified view.

Tran","Discriminative Local Sparse Representations for Robust Face Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key recent advance in face recognition models a test face image as a sparse
linear combination of a set of training face images. The resulting sparse
representations have been shown to possess robustness against a variety of
distortions like random pixel corruption, occlusion and disguise. This approach
however makes the restrictive (in many scenarios) assumption that test faces
must be perfectly aligned (or registered) to the training data prior to
classification. In this paper, we propose a simple yet robust local block-based
sparsity model, using adaptively-constructed dictionaries from local features
in the training data, to overcome this misalignment problem. Our approach is
inspired by human perception: we analyze a series of local discriminative
features and combine them to arrive at the final classification decision. We
propose a probabilistic graphical model framework to explicitly mine the
conditional dependencies between these distinct sparse local features. In
particular, we learn discriminative graphs on sparse representations obtained
from distinct local slices of a face. Conditional correlations between these
sparse features are first discovered (in the training phase), and subsequently
exploited to bring about significant improvements in recognition rates.
Experimental results obtained on benchmark face databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the presence of multiple
registration errors (such as translation, rotation, and scaling) as well as
under variations of pose and illumination.

this algebra cannot be postulated as Lie algebra. As consequence, extended

QMFT, all these $^{48}Ca$-induced reactions are cold fusion reactions with
relative excitation energies larger than for the $Pb$-induced cold fusion
reactions and smaller than for the lighter beam i.e. $Mg$, $Si$ or $S$-induced
hot fusion reactions. The same reactions were first suggested by Gupta et al.
in 1977 on the basis of QMFT, and this study re-establishes the same result. In
fact, for such heavy isotopes of Z=110 to 116, $^{50}Ca$ is shown to be a
better beam for cold fusion, but $^{50}Ca$ is a radioactive nucleus. The
$\alpha$-decay half-lives of these nuclei after 3n and/ or 4n evaporations,
i.e. of the evaporation residues of these compound systems, calculated on PCM
compare reasonably well with experiments published by Dubna group and another
recent calculation. As expected for such rare decays, PCM calculations show
that the $\alpha$-preformation factors are small, $\sim 10^{-8}$ to $10^{-10}$.
The possible competition of $\alpha$-decays with heavy cluster emissions from
these superheavy nuclei is also probed from the point of view of searching for
new nuclear structure information and possible future experiments with such

circular shape were determined from a microwave experiment. They were compared
to a semiclassical trace formula obtained within a two-dimensional model based
on the effective index of refraction approximation and a good agreement was
found. It was necessary to take into account the dispersion of the effective
index of refraction for the two-dimensional approximation. Furthermore, small
deviations between the experimental length spectrum and the trace formula
prediction were attributed to the systematic error of the effective index of
refraction approximation. In summary, the methods developed in this article
enable the application of the trace formula for two-dimensional dielectric
resonators also to realistic, flat three-dimensional dielectric microcavities
and -lasers, allowing for the interpretation of their spectra in terms of
classical periodic orbits.

red efficiency of the DES camera will significantly improve high-redshift color

will be obtained from spectroscopic observations of the host. A supernova
spectrum will be obtained for a subset of the sample, which will be utilized
for control studies. In addition, we have investigated the use of combined
photometric redshifts taking into account data from both the host and
supernova. We have investigated and estimated the likely contamination from
core-collapse supernovae based on photometric identification, and have found
that a Type Ia supernova sample purity of up to 98% is obtainable given
specific assumptions. Furthermore, we present systematic uncertainties due to
sample purity, photometric calibration, dust extinction priors, filter-centroid
shifts, and inter-calibration. We conclude by estimating the uncertainty on the

starts to decrease around one virial radius of clusters (r_{200,cl}) as
decreasing clustercentric radius, while that of late types starts to decrease
close to the cluster center (R~0.1-0.5r_{200,cl}). The AGN fractions of
early-type cluster galaxies on average are found to be lower than those of
early-type field galaxies by a factor ~3. However, the mean AGN fractions of
late-type cluster galaxies are similar to those of late-type field galaxies.
The AGN fraction of early-type BCGs lies between those of other early-type,
cluster and field galaxies with similar luminosities. In the field, the AGN
fraction strongly depends on the morphology of and the distance to the nearest
neighbor galaxy. We find an anti-correlation between the AGN fraction and the
velocity dispersion of clusters for all subsamples divided by morphology and
luminosity of host galaxies. The AGN power indicated by L_[OIII]/M_BH is found
to depend strongly on the mass of host galaxies rather than the clustercentric
radius. The difference in physical parameters such as luminosity, (u-r) colors,
SFRs, and (g-i) color gradients between AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies is seen
for both early and late types at all clustercentric radii, while the difference

two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM), constrained by necessary
$N$-representability conditions, provides a polynomial-scaling approach to
studying strongly correlated molecules without computing the many-electron
wavefunction. Here we introduce a new route to enhancing necessary conditions
for $N$-representability through rank restriction of the 2-RDM. Rather than
adding computationally more expensive $N$-representability conditions, we
directly enhance the accuracy of two-particle (2-positivity) conditions through
rank restriction, which removes degrees of freedom in the 2-RDM that are not
sufficiently constrained. We select the rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM by
deriving the ranks associated with model wavefunctions including both
mean-field and antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wave functions. Because the
2-positivity conditions are exact for quantum systems with AGP ground states,
the rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM from the AGP ansatz provides a minimum for
its value in variational 2-RDM calculations of general quantum systems. To
implement the rank-restricted conditions, we extend a first-order algorithm for
large-scale semidefinite programming. The rank-restricted conditions
significantly improve the accuracy of the energies; for example, the
percentages of correlation energies recovered for HF, CO, and N$_{2}$ improve
from 115.2%, 121.7%, and 121.5% without rank restriction to 97.8%, 101.1%, and
100.0% with rank restriction. Similar results are found at both equilibrium and
non-equilibrium geometries. While more accurate, the rank-restricted
$N$-representability conditions are less expensive computationally than the
full-rank conditions.

probing directly the canonical commutation relation of the center of mass mode

fragmentation through a scaling of the physical opacity. This model allows us
to directly calculate the critical cooling time of Gammie (2001), with results
that are consistent with those found from numerical experiment. We demonstrate
how this model can be used to predict fragmentation in irradiated protostellar
discs. These numerical simulations, as well as the model that they motivate,
provide strong support for the hypothesis that gravitational instability is
responsible for creating systems with giant planets on wide orbits.

ubiquitous phenomenon in nonlinear wave propagation, with the requirement for a
nonlinearity being their only unifying characteristics. While many mechanisms
have been demonstrated to explain the appearance of rogue waves in a specific
system, there is no known generic mechanism or general set of criteria shown to
rule their appearance. Presupposing only the existence of a nonlinear
Schr\""odinger-type equation together with a concave dispersion profile around a
zero dispersion wavelength we demonstrate that solitons may experience
acceleration and strong reshaping due to the interaction with continuum
radiation, giving rise to extreme-value phenomena. The mechanism is independent
of the optical Raman effect. A strong increase of the peak power is accompanied
by a mild increase of the pulse energy and carrier frequency, whereas the
photon number of the soliton remains practically constant. This reshaping
mechanism is particularly robust and may explain the appearance of rogue waves

provides an abstract framework containing a wide variety of fluid networks.
Within this framework a Lyapunov method for stability of GFN models was
proposed by Ye and Chen. They proved that stability of a GFN model is
equivalent to the existence of a functional on the set of paths that is
decaying along paths. This result falls short of a converse Lyapunov theorem in
that no state dependent Lyapunov function is constructed. In this paper we
construct state-dependent Lyapunov functions in contrast to path-wise
functionals. We first show by counterexamples that closed GFN models do not
provide sufficient information that allow for a converse Lyapunov theorem. To
resolve this problem we introduce the class of strict GFN models by forcing the
closed GFN model to satisfy a concatenation and a semicontinuity condition of
the set of paths in dependence of initial condition. For the class of strict
GFN models we define a state-dependent Lyapunov and show that a converse
Lyapunov theorem holds. Finally, it is shown that common fluid network models,

decoherence. This procedure, which has been extensively used in single particle
physics, is here employed in a spin ladder. The isolated chains have 1/2 spins

propagation. One of them constitutes the controlled system S whose reversible
dynamics is degraded by the weak coupling with the uncontrolled second chain,

combinations of XY and Ising like interactions, that contain the standard
Heisenberg and dipolar ones. Different time regimes are identified for the
Loschmidt Echo dynamics in this perturbative configuration. In particular, the
exponential decay scales as a Fermi golden rule, where the contributions of the
different SE terms are individually evaluated and analyzed. Comparisons with
previous analytical and numerical evaluations of decoherence based on the
attenuation of specific interferences, show that the Loschmidt Echo is an

couplings to SM particles are proportional to the their masses, similar to the
usual Higgs boson, but suppressed by a scale $\Lambda_r$, the radion vacuum
expectation value. The main differences are the coupling to massless gauge
bosons that receives contribution from the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum
tensor due to the the nonvanishing $\beta$ functions and the mixing with the
Higgs boson arising from a nonminimal coupling to gravity parametrized by a
dimensionless coefficient $\xi$. In particular, these differences can result in
significant modifications of the radion phenomenology.We use current LHC data
on Higgs searches to find exclusion regions on the parameters of a radion

Standard Model Higgs has been excluded, for a narrow range of values for the

as the vertices of a Bethe lattice, where each node has nonzero spatial
dimension and is described by an O(N) quantum rotor model, and there is hopping
between neighboring nodes. In the limit of large connectivity on the Bethe

action for a single node. This procedure is akin to dynamical mean field
theory, but generalized so that spatial as well as quantum fluctuations are
taken into account on each node. The quantum phase transition is studied using
this effective action for both infinite and finite N. The importance of the
Perron-Frobenius uniform mode on the Bethe lattice is discussed, and its
elimination via an ""infinite range hopping"" term shifts the transition, leading
to nontrivial critical behavior. We calculate critical exponents and find that
the internode hopping reduces the upper and lower critical dimensions each by
one, indicating that--at least for the purposes of quantum criticality--the
large number of internode couplings is similar to adding a single extra
dimension to the theory describing a single node.

In this paper, we extend our previous calculations by independently deriving

at fixed-order, the effect of jet clustering on both $\CF^{2}$ and $\CF\CA$

dynamic data. Most of these recent methods aim at exhibiting community
partitions from successive graph snapshots and thereafter connecting or
smoothing these partitions using clever time-dependent features and sampling
techniques. These approaches are nonetheless achieving longitudinal rather than
dynamic community detection. We assume that communities are fundamentally
defined by the repetition of interactions among a set of nodes over time.
According to this definition, analyzing the data by considering successive
snapshots induces a significant loss of information: we suggest that it blurs
essentially dynamic phenomena - such as communities based on repeated
inter-temporal interactions, nodes switching from a community to another across
time, or the possibility that a community survives while its members are being
integrally replaced over a longer time period. We propose a formalism which
aims at tackling this issue in the context of time-directed datasets (such as
citation networks), and present several illustrations on both empirical and
synthetic dynamic networks. We eventually introduce intrinsically dynamic
metrics to qualify temporal community structure and emphasize their possible
role as an estimator of the quality of the community detection - taking into
account the fact that various empirical contexts may call for distinct
`community' definitions and detection criteria.

we can extract from a quantum system. To tackle this question we here take on
the study of quantum-to-classical randomness extractors (QC-extractors). We
provide constructions of QC-extractors based on measurements in a full set of
mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), and certain single qubit measurements. As the
first application, we show that any QC-extractor gives rise to entropic
uncertainty relations with respect to quantum side information. Such relations
were previously only known for two measurements. As the second application, we
resolve the central open question in the noisy-storage model [Wehner et al.,
PRL 100, 220502 (2008)] by linking security to the quantum capacity of the
adversary's storage device.

new scales and collective variables become excited while the old ones recede

that are based on atomic scale scrutiny. Here we consider an effective
dynamical Landau theory to model the folding process at biologically relevant
time and distance scales. We reach both a substantial decrease in the execution
time and improvement in the accuracy of the final configuration, in comparison
to more conventional approaches. As an example we inspect the collapse of HP35
chicken villin headpiece subdomain, where there are detailed molecular dynamics
simulations to compare with. We start from a structureless, unbend and
untwisted initial configuration. In less than one second of wall-clock time on
a single processor personal computer we consistently reach the native state
with 0.5 Angstrom root mean square distance (RMSD) precision. We confirm that
our folding pathways are indeed akin those obtained in recent atomic level
molecular dynamics simulations. We conclude that our approach appears to have
the potential for a computationally economical method to accurately understand
theoretical aspects of protein collapse.

strong coupling as the coupling is oscillating rather than growing or decaying

still far too large during inflation if the generated magnetic fields are
required to have a strength of order 10^{-15} Gauss today on observationally
interesting scales. We provide a more general no-go argument, proving that this
problem will apply to any model in which the magnetic fields are generated on

the emergence of orbital order in conjunction with the charge density
modulations. Here we show that a closely related charge and orbital ordered
state arises in 2H-TaS2. In both materials, the microscopic mechanism driving
the transition is based on the interaction between three differently polarized
displacement waves. The relative phase shifts between these waves lead both to
the formation of orbital order and to the breakdown of inversion symmetry. In
contrast to 1T-TiSe2 however, the presence of a mirror plane in the lattice of
2H-TaS2 prevents the distorted structure in this material from being chiral,
and a polar charge and orbital ordered state arises instead. It is stressed
that bulk experiments are indispensable in differentiating between the chiral
and polar phases.

gain and loss are engineered to be $PT$ symmetric has many remarkable features.
In particular the usual unitarity relations are not satisfied, so that the
reflection coefficients can be greater than one, and in general are not the
same for left or right incidence. Within the class of optical potentials of the
form $v(x)=v_1\cos(2\beta x)+iv_2\sin(2\beta x)$ the case $v_2=v_1$ is of
particular interest, as it lies on the boundary of $PT$-symmetry breaking. It
has been shown in a recent paper by Lin et al. that in this case one has the
property of ""unidirectional invisibility"", while for propagation in the other
direction there is a greatly enhanced reflection coefficient proportional to
$L^2$, where $L$ is the length of the medium in the direction of propagation.
  For this potential we show how analytic expressions can be obtained for the
various transmission and reflection coefficients, which are expressed in a very
succinct form in terms of modified Bessel functions. While our numerical
results agree very well with those of Lin et al. we find that the invisibility
is not quite exact, in amplitude or phase. As a test of our formulas we show
that they identically satisfy a modified version of unitarity appropriate for
$PT$-symmetric potentials. We also examine how the enhanced transmission comes
about for a wave-packet, as opposed to a plane wave, finding that the
enhancement now arises through an increase, of $O(L)$, in the pulse length,
rather than the amplitude.

centred on the nominal position of Wd 1 and detected with a total statistical
significance of ~20\sigma. The emission region clearly extends beyond the

a power law in energy with an index of \Gamma=2.19 \pm 0.08_{stat} \pm
0.20_{sys} and a flux normalisation at 1 TeV of \Phi_0 = (9.0 \pm 1.4_{stat}

TeV amounts to (5.2 \pm 0.9) x 10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Four objects coincident
with HESS J1646-458 are discussed in the search of a counterpart, namely the
magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216, the X-ray binary 4U 1642-45, the pulsar PSR
J1648-4611 and the massive stellar cluster Wd 1. In a single-source scenario,
Wd 1 is favoured as site of VHE particle acceleration. Here, a hadronic parent

is evidence for a multi-source origin, where a scenario involving PSR

first 20 months of Fermi-LAT data and optical monitoring. In this paper, a
connection between the gamma-ray and optical variability of 3C345 and
properties of its parsec-scale radio emission is investigated. Methods: The
Fermi-LAT data of 3C345, covering an energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, were combined
with 32 Very Long Baseline Array observations of the object made at 43.2 GHz in
the period of January 2008 - March 2010. Results: The VLBA data reveal
morphology and kinematics of the flow on scales of up to ~5 milliarcseconds
(mas; deprojected linear distances of 380 parsecs). The brightness temperature,
T_b(r), measured along the jet first decreases with distance proportional to
r^-(0.95 +/-0.69) and later exhibits a break at ~0.3 mas, with T_b(r)
proportional to r^-(4.11 +/-0.85) at larger separations. Variations of the
gamma-ray, optical and parsec-scale radio emission show a similar long-term
trend persistent during the entire VLBA monitoring period. The gamma-ray and
optical variations on shorter time scales are related to structural changes in
the jet on scales of ~0.3 mas (~23 parsecs, deprojected), with the gamma-ray
and optical flares possibly related to the evolution of four distinct
superluminal components identified in the flow. Conclusions: The observations
indicate that both the quiescent and flaring components of the gamma-ray
emission are produced in a region of the jet of ~23 pc in extent. This region
may mark the Compton-loss dominated zone of the flow and its large extent may
favor the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism for gamma-ray production in the
relativistic jet of the quasar 3C345.

best-fitting hosts of the dwarf spheroidals all have 12 < Vmax < 25 km/s, LCDM
simulations predict at least ten subhalos with Vmax > 25 km/s. These subhalos
are also among the most massive at earlier times, and significantly exceed the
UV suppression mass back to z ~ 10. No LCDM-based model of the satellite
population of the Milky Way explains this result. The problem lies in the
satellites' densities: it is straightforward to match the observed Milky Way
luminosity function, but doing so requires the dwarf spheroidals to have dark
matter halos that are a factor of ~5 more massive than is observed. Independent
of the difficulty in explaining the absence of these dense, massive subhalos,
there is a basic tension between the derived properties of the bright Milky Way
dwarf spheroidals and LCDM expectations. The inferred infall masses of these
galaxies are all approximately equal and are much lower than standard LCDM
predictions for systems with their luminosities. Consequently, their implied
star formation efficiencies span over two orders of magnitude, from 0.2% to 20%
of baryons converted into stars, in stark contrast with expectations gleaned
from more massive galaxies. We explore possible solutions to these problems

injected by AGB stars in the interstellar medium does not increase
monotonically with stellar mass and ranges between a minimum of 10^{-6}Msun for
the 1.5Msun stellar model, up to 2x10^{-4} Msun, for the 6Msun case. Dust
composition depends on the stellar mass: low-mass stars (M < 3Msun) produce
carbon-rich dust, whereas more massive stars, experiencing Hot Bottom Burning,
never reach the carbon-star stage, and produce silicates and iron. This is in
partial disagreement with previous investigations in the literature, which are
based on synthetic AGB models and predict that, when the initial metallicity is
Z=0.001, C-rich dust is formed at all stellar masses. The differences are due
to the different modelling of turbulent convection in the super-adiabaticity
regime. Also in this case the treatment of super-adiabatic convection shows up
as the most relevant issue affecting the dust-formation process. We also
investigate Super AGB stars with masses 6.5Msun<M<8 Msun that evolve over a ONe
core.Due to a favourable combination of mass loss and Hot Bottom Burning, these

efficiencies cause the observed sigma of the faint-side Gaussian to change with
magnitude due to contamination from redder main sequence stars (40% at 21st

= 0. For z < 4 about a half of the metals are locked into stars while the
fraction present in the WHIM and in the diffuse medium increases with a
decreasing redshift. In the redshift range 0 < z < 2.5, the amount of metals in
the WHIM increases from 4% to 22% while in the diffuse medium it increases from
0.6% to 4%. This enrichment process is due essentially to a turbulent diffusion
mechanism associated to mass motions driven by supernova explosions. At z = 0,
simulated blue (late type) galaxies show a correlation of the oxygen abundance
present in the cold gas with the luminosity of the considered galaxy that
agrees quite well with data derived from HII regions.

population of couples of bodies which reside on very similar heliocentric
orbits. Vokrouhlicky & Nesvorny (2008, AJ 136, 280) promoted a term ""asteroid
pairs"", pointing out their common origin within the past tens to hundreds of
ky. Previous attempts to reconstruct the initial configuration of Rheinland and
2001NQ8 at the time of their separation have led to the prediction that
Rheinland's rotation should be retrograde. Here we report extensive photometric
observations of this asteroid and use the lightcurve inversion technique to
directly determine its rotation state and shape. We confirm the retrograde
sense of rotation of Rheinland, with obliquity value constrained to be >= 140
deg. The ecliptic longitude of the pole position is not well constrained as
yet. The asymmetric behavior of Rheinland's lightcurve reflects a sharp,
near-planar edge in our convex shape representation of this asteroid. Our
calibrated observations in the red filter also allow us to determine $H_R =
13.68\pm 0.05$ and $G = 0.31\pm 0.05$ values of the H-G system. With the
characteristic color index $V-R = 0.49\pm 0.05$ for the S-type asteroids, we
thus obtain $H = 14.17\pm 0.07$ for the absolute magnitude of (6070) Rheinland.
This a significantly larger value than previously obtained from analysis of the
astrometric survey observations. We next use the obliquity constraint for
Rheinland to eliminate some degree of uncertainty in the past propagation of
its orbit. This is because the sign of the past secular change of its semimajor
axis due to the Yarkovsky effect is now constrained. Determination of the
rotation state of the secondary component, asteroid (54827) 2001NQ8, is the key
element in further constraining the age of the pair and its formation process.

imaging. The problem of counting photons can then conveniently be viewed as
statistical inference of flux or photon rates, based on a stack of images. A
simple probabilistic model for the output of an EMCCD is developed. Based on
this model and the prior knowledge that photons are Poisson distributed, we
derive two methods for estimating the most probable flux per pixel, one based
on thresholding, and another based on full Bayesian inference. We find that it

that estimating fluxes with only shot noise is possible, up to fluxes of about
one photon per pixel per readout.

black hole masses and host galaxy bulge properties suggest that the method is
accurate to +/- 0.15 dex. Contrary to what was thought when the black hole mass
- stellar velocity dispersion (""M - sigma"") relationship was first discovered,
it does not have a lower dispersion than the black hole mass - bulge luminosity
(""M - L"") relationship. The dispersion in the M - L relationship for AGNs
decreases strongly with increasing black hole mass or bulge luminosity. This is
naturally explained as a consequence of the black hole - bulge relationships
being the result of averaging due to mergers. Simulations show that the
decrease in dispersion in the M - L relationship with increasing mass is in
qualitative agreement with being driven by mergers. The large scatter in AGN
black hole masses at lower masses rules out significant AGN feedback. A
non-causal origin of the correlations between black holes and bulges explains
the frequent lack of supermassive black holes in late-type galaxies, and the
lack of correlation of black hole mass with pseudo-bulges.

regions, KAM surfaces effectively acting as ""barriers"" against field-line

magnetic barriers can form in piecewise analytic DIII-D plasma equilibria. In
the present work, the formation of magnetic barriers at DIII-D is corroborated

include the vacuum field from the internal coils utilized in the experiments.
According to these calculations, the occurrence and location of magnetic
barriers depends on the edge safety factor q95. It was thus suggested that
magnetic barriers might contribute to narrowing the edge stochastic layer and
play an indirect role in the RMPs failing to control ELMs for certain values of
q95. The analysis of DIII-D discharges where q95 was varied, however, does not
show anti-correlation between barrier formation and ELM suppression.

to simulate energy depositions in various detectors and materials. These
simulations have mostly been run with a source beam outside the detector. In
the case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on
the detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From
this standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of
sources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation
framework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach
to event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple
radioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with
the entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run.
Various levels of information can also be recorded from the individual
components, with these record levels also being set at runtime. This
flexibility in both source generation and information recording is possible
without the need to recompile, reducing the complexity of code management and
the proliferation of versions. Within the code itself, casting geometry objects
within this new set of classes rather than as the default Geant4 classes
automatically extends this flexibility to every individual component. No
additional work is required on the part of the developer, reducing development
time and increasing confidence in the results. We describe the guiding
principles behind LUXSim, detail some of its unique classes and methods, and
give examples of usage.

weak-coupling renormalization group (RG) methods with extremely short-range and
extremely long-range interactions to the case of finite-range interactions. In
particular, we consider different types of interactions including screened
Coulomb interactions, much like those produced by a point charge placed either
above a single infinite conducting plate or exactly halfway between two
parallel infinite conducting plates. Our considerations are motivated by the
fact that, in some recent experiments on bilayer graphene there is a single
gate while in others there are two gates, which can function as the conducting
planes and which, we argue, can lead to distinct broken symmetry phases. We map
out the phases that the system enters as a function of the range of the
interaction. We discover that the system enters an antiferromagnetic phase for
short ranges of the interaction and a nematic phase at long ranges, in
agreement with previous work. While the antiferromagnetic phase results in a
gap in the spectrum, the nematic phase is gapless, splitting the quadratic
degeneracy points into two Dirac cones each. We also consider the effects of an
applied magnetic field on the system in the antiferromagnetic phase via
variational mean field theory. At low fields, we find that the
antiferromagnetic order parameter, Delta(B)-Delta(0) \sim B^2. At higher
fields, when omega_c > 2*Delta_0, we find that
Delta(B)=omega_c/[ln(omega_c/Delta(0))+C], where C=0.67 and omega_c=eB/m^*c. We
also determine the energy gap for creating electron-hole excitations in the

theoretical inferences that are only based on the precise model definitions and
rely strongly, in addition, on some consequential working hypotheses. Thus, it
is important to address the question of which features of a model effectively
carry some modelling meaning and which only result from the task of formalising
observations of reality into a mathematical language. In this article, we
address this question with a theoretical point view that sets our discussion
strictly between the two stages of the modelling process that require knowledge
of real systems, that is, between the initial stage that chooses a global
theoretical framework to build the model and the final stage that exploits its
formal predictions by comparing them to the reality that the model was designed
to simulate. Taking Boolean automata networks as instances of models of systems
observed in reality, we analyse in this setting the remaining stages of the
modelling process and we show how the meaning of theoretical concepts can
subtly rely on formal choices such as definitions and hypotheses.

the companion, HBC 425C, is ~2.4 magnitudes fainter at 2.2 microns.
Moderate-resolution (R~2500) J- and K-band spectroscopy reveal HBC 425C to have
an M5.5 (+/-0.5) spectral type. Comparisons with pre-main sequence evolutionary
models imply a mass of ~0.09 M(Sun) and ages of 8-10 Myr, assuming the nominal

present high dispersion, optical spectra of HBC 425 and HBC 425C obtained using
the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on Keck I. We detect strong Li
I 6708 absorption in the spectrum of HBC 425C. Using curves of growth for the
Li I 6708 doublet, we estimate its abundance level to lie between log N(Li)=1.9
and 3.1 dex. The spectrum of HBC 425 exhibits Ca II H & K, He I 5876, 6678, and
strong Balmer line emission, consistent with accretion. We place more
restrictive upper limits on the surface abundance of lithium and find that HBC
425 retains less than ~0.1% of its primordial abundance. The presence of
lithium in the photosphere of HBC 425C does not resolve the discrepancy between
isochronal and lithium depletion ages for the primary pair. However, if lithium
were depleted relative to interstellar abundance levels, even minimally,
considerable support would be gained for the more advanced age of this
hierarchical triple system.

the existence of truly neutral types of fermions. Among them one can find both

the electric and weak parts, in the presence of which a neutrino has the
anapole charge, charge radius and electric dipole moment. They constitute the
paraneutrino of true neutrality, for example, at the neutrino interaction with
a spinless nucleus of an axial-vector current. We derive the united equations
which relate the structural components of mass to anapole, charge radius and
electric dipole of each truly neutral neutrino at the level of flavour
symmetry. Such a principle can explain the C-noninvariant nature of neutrinos
and fields in the framework of constancy law of the size implied from the
multiplication of a weak mass of the C-odd neutrino by its electric mass. From
this point of view, all neutrinos of C-antisymmetricality regardless of the
difference in masses of an axial-vector character, possess the same anapole
with his radius as well as the identical electric dipole. Their analysis
together with earlier measurements of an electric dipole moment of neutrino

paper, we introduce new behavioral metrics to quantify the level of controversy
associated with a particular user: a Controversy Score (C-Score) based on the
amount of attention the user focuses on controversial pages, and a Clustered
Controversy Score (CC-Score) that also takes into account topical clustering.
We show that both these measures are useful for identifying people who try to
""push"" their points of view, by showing that they are good predictors of which
editors get blocked. The metrics can be used to triage potential POV pushers.
We apply this idea to a dataset of users who requested promotion to
administrator status and easily identify some editors who significantly changed
their behavior upon becoming administrators. At the same time, such behavior is
not rampant. Those who are promoted to administrator status tend to have more
stable behavior than comparable groups of prolific editors. This suggests that
the Adminship process works well, and that the Wikipedia community is not

single-relay channel. We analytically show that the rate achievable by
partial-decode-forward outperforms that of the more straightforward
complete-decode-forward by at most 12.5%. Furthermore, in the following
asymptotic cases, the gap between the partial-decode-forward and the
complete-decode-forward rates diminishes: (i) when the relay is close to the
source, (ii) when the relay is close to the destination, and (iii) when the SNR
is low. In addition, when the SNR increases, this gap, when normalized to the
complete-decode-forward rate, also diminishes. Consequently, significant
performance improvements are not achieved by optimizing the fraction of data
the relay should decode and forward, over simply decoding the entire source
message.

magnet and the capability of stabilization of the hitherto unexpected O8
cluster structure in its solid form at high pressure. Molecular dissociations
upon compression as one of the fundamental problems were reported for other
diatomic solids (e.g., H2, I2, Br2, and N2), but it remains elusive for solid
oxygen, making oxygen an intractable system. We here report the theoretical
prediction on the dissociation of molecular oxygen into a polymeric spiral
chain O4 structure (\theta-O4) by using first-principles calypso method on
crystal structure prediction. The \theta-O4 stabilizes above 2 TPa and has been
observed as the third high pressure phase of sulfur (S-III). We find that the
molecular O8 phase remains extremely stable in a large pressure range of 0.008
- 2 TPa, whose breakdown is driven by the pressure-induced instability of a
transverse acoustic phonon mode at zone boundary, leading to the ultimate
formation of \theta-O4. Remarkably, stabilization of \theta-O4 turns oxygen
from a superconductor into an insulator with a wide band gap (approximately 5.9
eV) originating from the sp3-like hybridized orbitals of oxygen and the
localization of valence electrons. (This is a pre-print version of the

studying this problem is its utility as a model for relay augmentation of
wireless sensor networks. In these scenarios one seeks to optimise power
consumption -- which is predominantly due to communication and, in free space,
is proportional to the square of transmission distance -- in the network by
introducing additional relays. We prove several geometric and combinatorial
results on the structure of optimal and locally optimal solution-trees (under
various strategies for bounding the number of Steiner points) and describe a

accretes He from a companion. If the accretion rate allows a sufficiently large
mass of He to accumulate prior to ignition of nuclear burning, the He surface
layer may detonate, giving rise to an astrophysical transient. Detonation of
the He layer generates shock waves that propagate into the underlying CO WD.
This might directly ignite a detonation at the edge of the CO WD or compress
the core of the WD sufficiently to trigger a CO detonation near the centre. If
either ignition mechanism works, the two detonations can release sufficient
energy to completely unbind the WD. Here we extend our 2D studies of this
double-detonation model to low-mass CO WDs. We investigate the feasibility of
triggering a secondary core detonation by shock convergence in low-mass CO WDs
and the observable consequences of such a detonation. Our results suggest that
core detonation is probable, even for the lowest CO core masses realized in
nature. We compute spectra and light curves for models in which either an
edge-lit or compression-triggered CO detonation is assumed to occur and compare
these to models in which no CO detonation was allowed to occur. If significant
shock compression of the CO WD occurs prior to detonation, explosion of the CO
WD can produce a sufficiently large mass of radioactive iron-group nuclei to
affect the light curves. In particular, this can lead to relatively slow
post-maximum decline. If the secondary detonation is edge-lit, however, the CO
WD explosion primarily yields intermediate-mass elements that affect the
observables more subtly. In this case, NIR observations and detailed
spectroscopic analysis would be needed to determine whether core detonation
occurred. We comment on the implications of our results for understanding
peculiar astrophysical transients including SN 2002bj, SN 2010X and SN 2005E.

the N Higgs doublet models, where Higgs fields arise as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
modes of a strongly interacting sector. We show that there are several
relations among the dimension-six operators, and therefore the number of
independent operators decreases compared with models on which only SU(2)_L x
U(1)_Y invariance is imposed. As an explicit example, we derive scattering
amplitudes of longitudinal gauge bosons and Higgs bosons at high energy on
models involving two Higgs doublets, and compare them with the amplitudes in
the case of one Higgs doublet.

access local geometric information and find efficient pathways on networks
plays a crucial role, rather than the globally optimal pathways. We present a
simple greedy spatial navigation strategy as a probe to explore spatial

they take, without being trapped in a dead end based on their memory about
previous routes. We suggest that the centralities measures have to be modified
to incorporate the navigators' behavior, and present the intriguing effect of
navigators' greediness where removing some edges may actually enhance the
routing efficiency, which is reminiscent of Braess's paradox. In addition,
using samples of road structures in large cities around the world, it is shown
that the navigability measure we define reflects unique structural properties,
which are not easy to predict from other topological characteristics. In this
respect, we believe that our routing scheme significantly moves the routing
problem on networks one step closer to reality, incorporating the inevitable
incompleteness of navigators' information.

presented by which a molecule subjected to forced oscillations, out of thermal

presence of very intense noise, so intense that no entanglement is possible
when the forced oscillations cease. This mechanism may allow for the presence
of non-trivial quantum entanglement in biological systems. Here we
significantly enlarge the study of this model. In particular, we show that the
persistent generation of dynamic entanglement is not restricted to the bosonic
heat bath model, but it can also be observed in other decoherence models, e.g.
the spin gas model, and in non-Markovian scenarios. We also show how
conformational changes can be used by an elementary machine to generate

of the great open problems in computational complexity theory. In the paper
""Bounds on monotone switching networks for directed connectivity"", we separated
monotone analogues of L and NL using a model called the switching network
model. In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and
isolated vertices, we proved that any monotone switching network solving
directed connectivity on $N$ vertices must have size at least
$N^{\Omega(\lg(N))}$ and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result
for general switching networks solving directed connectivity, then this would
prove that $L \neq NL$. However, proving lower bounds for general switching
networks solving directed connectivity requires proving stronger lower bounds
on monotone switching networks for directed connectivity. To work towards this
goal, we investigated a different set of inputs which we believed to be hard
for monotone switching networks to solve and attempted to prove similar lower
size bounds. Instead, we found that this set of inputs is actually easy for
monotone switching networks for directed connectivity to solve, yet if we
restrict ourselves to certain-knowledge switching networks, which are a simple
and intuitive subclass of monotone switching networks for directed
connectivity, then these inputs are indeed hard to solve. In this paper, we
give this set of inputs, demonstrate a ""weird"" polynomially-sized monotone
switching network for directed connectivity which solves this set of inputs,
and prove that no polynomially-sized certain-knowledge switching network can
solve this set of inputs, thus proving that monotone switching networks for
directed connectivity are strictly more powerful than certain-knowledge
switching networks.

by femtosecond x-ray free electron laser pulses. The 830 eV laser pulses induce
a phase transition in the material which is characterized ex-situ. The phase
transition energy threshold is determined by measuring the surface of each
irradiated area using an optical Nomarski microscope. The threshold fluence is
found to be 282 +/- 11 mJ/cm^2, corresponding to an absorbed dose at the
surface of 131 +/-5 meV/atom. Atomic force microscopy measurements show volume
expansion of the irradiated sample area, suggesting a solid to solid phase
transition. Deeper insight into the phase transition is gained by using
scanning photoelectron microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Photoelectron
microscopy shows graphitization, i.e. modification from sp3 to sp2
hybridization, of the irradiated material. The micro-Raman spectra show the
appearance of local order, i.e. formation of graphite nanocrystals. Finally,
the nature of the phase transition is discussed, taking into account previous

CFHT/WIRCAM near-infrared survey of GOODS-North, we discuss the relation
between star formation rate (SFR), specific star formation rate (SSFR), and
stellar mass (M_{*}), and the clustering of galaxies as a function of these
parameters. For star-forming galaxies (sBzKs), the UV-based SFR, corrected for
extinction, scales with the stellar mass as SFR ~ M_{*}^{alpha} with alpha =
0.74+/-0.20 down to M_{*} ~ 10^{9} M_{solar}, indicating a weak dependence on
the stellar mass of the SSFR. We also measure the angular correlation function
and hence infer the correlation length for sBzK galaxies as a function of
M_{*}, SFR, and SSFR, as well as K-band apparent magnitude. We show that
passive galaxies (pBzKs) are more strongly clustered than sBzK galaxies at a
given stellar mass, mirroring the color-density relation seen at lower
redshifts. We also find that the correlation length of sBzK galaxies ranges
from 4 to 20 h^{-1}Mpc, being a strong function of M_{K}, M_{*}, and SFR. On
the other hand, the clustering dependence on SSFR changes abruptly at 2x10^{-9}
yr^{-1}, which is the typical value for ""main sequence"" star-forming galaxies
at z~2. We show that the correlation length reaches a minimum at this
characteristic value, and is larger for galaxies with both smaller and larger
SSFRs; a dichotomy that is only marginally implied from the predictions of the
semi-analytical models. Our results suggest that there are two types of
environmental effects at work at z~2. Stronger clustering for relatively
quiescent galaxies implies that the environment has started to play a role in
quenching star formation. At the same time, stronger clustering for galaxies
with elevated SSFRs (""starbursts"") might be attributed to an increased
efficiency for galaxy interactions and mergers in dense environments.

(1370-1710\AA) continuum map. The H$\alpha$ intensity correlates well with the
FUV intensity. The H$\alpha$/FUV intensity ratio increases in general with the
H$\alpha$ intensity and the FUV hardness ratio (1370-1520\AA\ to 1560-1710\AA),
implying that late OB stars may be the main source of the H$\alpha$
recombination line at high latitudes. The variation of the H$\alpha$ intensity
as a function of the Galactic latitude is also very similar to that of the FUV
intensity. The results likely suggest that not only the original radiation
sources of the H$\alpha$ and FUV backgrounds but also the radiative transfer
mechanisms responsible for the diffuse backgrounds are largely common.
Therefore, we propose a scenario wherein the H$\alpha$ background at high
latitudes is mostly composed of two components, H$\alpha$ photons produced by
in-situ recombination at the ionized regions around late OB stars and
dust-scattered light of the H$\alpha$ photons originating from late OB stars.

weakly irreducible; and the spectral radius of T can be obtained from those

difficult task. Y. Bazlov settled the conjecture for g of type A using explicit
expressions for primitive invariants in the exterior algebra of g. Up to now
this approach did not lead to a proof for all simple Lie algebras. Recently, A.
Joseph proved that the second Kostant filtration coincides with the filtration
on h induced by the generalized Harish-Chandra projection $(Ug \otimes g)^g \to

Navier-Stokes equations is (link-wise) reformulated (referred to as LW-ACM) by

analogy with the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The main advantage is the
possibility of exploiting well established technologies originally developed
for LBM and classical computational fluid dynamics, with special emphasis on
finite differences (at least in the present paper), at the cost of minor
changes. For instance, wall boundaries not aligned with the background
Cartesian mesh can be taken into account by tracing the intersections of each
link with the wall (analogously to LBM technology). LW-ACM requires no
high-order moments beyond hydrodynamics (often referred to as ghost moments)
and no kinetic expansion. Like finite difference schemes, only standard Taylor
expansion is needed for analyzing consistency. Preliminary efforts towards
optimal implementations have shown that LW-ACM is capable of similar
computational speed as optimized (BGK-) LBM. In addition, the memory demand is
significantly smaller than (BGK-) LBM. Importantly, with an efficient
implementation, this algorithm may be one of the few which is compute-bound and
not memory-bound. Two- and three-dimensional benchmarks are investigated, and
an extensive comparative study between the present approach and state of the

Yet these motors are hindered at the end of the packaging process by the
progressive build-up of a force resisting packaging associated with already
packaged DNA. In this experimental work, we raise the issue of what sets the
upper limit on the length of the genome that can be packaged by the terminase
motor of phage {\lambda} and still yield infectious virions, and the conditions
under which this can be efficiently performed. Using a packaging strategy
developed in our laboratory of building phage {\lambda} from scratch, together
with plaque assay monitoring, we have been able to show that the terminase
motor of phage {\lambda} is able to produce infectious particles with up to
110% of the wild-type (WT) {\lambda}-DNA length. However, the phage production
rate, and thus the infectivity, decreased exponentially with increasing DNA
length, and was a factor of 103 lower for the 110% {\lambda}-DNA phage.
Interestingly, our in vitro strategy was still efficient in fully packaging
phages with DNA lengths as high as 114% of the WT length, but these viruses
were unable to infect bacterial cells efficiently. Further, we demonstrated
that the phage production rate is modulated by the presence of multivalent
ionic species. The biological consequences of these finding are discussed.

classified these blinkers into two categories, one associated with coronal
counterparts and other with no coronal counterparts as seen in XRT images and
EIS Fe XII 195.12 A raster images. Around two-thirds of the blinkers show
coronal counterparts and correspond to various events like EUV/X-ray jets,
brightenings in coronal bright points or foot-point brightenings of larger
loops. These brightenings occur repetitively and have a lifetime of around 40
min at transition region temperatures. The remaining blinker groups with no
coronal counterpart in XRT and EIS Fe XII 195.12 A appear as point-like
brightenings and have chromospheric/transition region origin. They take place
only once and have a lifetime of around 20 minutes. In general, lifetimes of
blinkers are different at different wavelengths, i.e. different temperatures,
decreasing from the chromosphere to the corona. This work shows that the term
blinker covers a range of phenomena. Blinkers are the EUV response of various
transient events originating at coronal, transition region and chromospheric
heights. Hence, events associated with blinkers contribute to the formation and
maintenance of the temperature gradient in the transition region and the
corona.

which takes into account the influence of spiral arms on amount of the above
elements synthesized by both the supernovae Type II and prompt supernovae Ia.
We solve this task without of any preliminary suppositions about the ratio
among the portions of iron synthesized by the above sources.
  The relative portion of iron synthesized by tardy supernovae Ia for the
life-time of the Galaxy is $\sim$35 per cent (in the present ISM this portion

the disc by supernovae Type II and prompt supernovae Ia is $\sim$65 per cent

synthesized during one explosion of supernovae and the shape (bimodal or
smooth) of the so-called Delay Time Distribution function.
  The portions of iron mass distributed between the short-lived supernovae are
usually as follows: depending on the ejected masses of oxygen or iron during
one supernovae Type II event the relative portion of iron, supplied to the
Galactic disc for its age, varies in the range 12 - 32 per cent (in the present

for OFDMA systems. To minimize overall transmitted power, we propose a novel
adaptive subcarrier and bit allocation algorithm based on channel state

that separately performs subcarrier allocation and bit loading is proposed. It
is shown that a near optimal solution is obtained by the proposed algorithm
which has low complexity compared to that of other conventional algorithm. We
will study the problem of finding an optimal sub-carrier and power allocation
strategy for downlink communication to multiple users in an OFDMA based
wireless system. Assuming knowledge of the instantaneous channel gains for all
users, we propose a multiuser OFDMA subcarrier, and bit allocation algorithm to
minimize the total transmit power. This is done by assigning each user a set of
subcarriers and by determining the number of bits and the transmit power level
for each subcarrier. The objective is to minimize the total transmitted power
over the entire network to satisfy the application layer and physical layer. We
formulate this problem as a constrained optimization problem and present
centralized algorithms. The simulation results will show that our approach
results in an efficient assignment of subcarriers and transmitter power levels

address this need, we also present a bit loading algorithm for allocating
subcarriers and bits in order to satisfy the rate requirements of the links.

resonance is observed in the spectra of magnetic permeability mu_a [H(omega)

excitation softens from 41 to 32 cm-1 on heating and finally disappears above
T_N. An additional weak and heavily-damped excitation is seen in the spectra of
complex dielectric permittivity epsilon_c within the same frequency range. This
excitation contributes to the dielectric spectra in both antiferromagnetic and
paramagnetic phases. Its oscillator strength significantly increases on heating
towards room temperature thus providing evidence of piezomagnetic or
higher-order couplings to polar phonons. Other heavily-damped dielectric
excitations are detected near 100 cm-1 in the paramagnetic phase in both
epsilon_c and epsilon_a spectra and they exhibit similar temperature behavior.
These excitations appearing in the frequency range of magnon branches well
below polar phonons could remind electromagnons; however, their temperature
dependence is quite different. We have used density functional theory for
calculating phonon dispersion branches in the whole Brillouin zone. A detailed
analysis of these results and of previously published magnon dispersion
branches brought us to the conclusion that the observed absorption bands stem
from phonon-phonon and phonon- paramagnon differential absorption processes.
The latter is enabled by a strong short-range in-plane spin correlations in the

this points out that the inner nebula is composed by electrons injected in the

Brownian motion model (GBM) used in the derivation of the Black-Scholes
formula. The theory of such models simplifies considerably if one takes a
pricing kernel approach. In one dimension, once the underlying L\'evy process
has been specified, the GLM has four parameters: the initial price, the
interest rate, the volatility, and the risk aversion. The pricing kernel is the
product of a discount factor and a risk aversion martingale. For GBM, the risk
aversion parameter is the market price of risk. For a GLM, this interpretation
is not valid: the excess rate of return is a nonlinear function of the
volatility and the risk aversion. It is shown that for positive volatility and
risk aversion the excess rate of return above the interest rate is positive,
and is increasing with respect to these variables. In the case of foreign
exchange, Siegel's paradox implies that one can construct foreign exchange
models for which the excess rate of return is positive both for the exchange
rate and the inverse exchange rate. This condition is shown to hold for any
geometric L\'evy model for foreign exchange in which volatility exceeds risk
aversion.

a conformal decomposition of the Z4 formulation of general relativity. We
demonstrate that in the linear, constant coefficient regime a novel
discretization for tensors is formally numerically stable with a method of
lines time-integrator. We then perform a full set of apples with apples tests
on the non-linear system, and thus present numerical evidence that both the new
and standard discretizations are, in some sense, numerically stable in the
non-linear regime. The results of the Z4c numerical tests are compared with
those of BSSNOK evolutions. We typically do not employ the Z4c constraint
damping scheme and find that in the robust stability and gauge wave tests the
Z4c evolutions result in lower constraint violation at the same resolution as
the BSSNOK evolutions. In the gauge wave tests we find that the Z4c evolutions
maintain the desired convergence factor over many more light-crossing times
than the BSSNOK tests. The difference in the remaining tests is marginal.

right- and left-hand side circularly polarised spectra are interpreted in terms
of a longitudinal magnetic field <B_z>.

HD150193, and P=0.899d for HD176386. The magnetic field geometry can likely be
described by a centred dipole with a polar magnetic field strength B_d of
several hundred Gauss. The longitudinal magnetic-field measurements of MWC480
reveal the presence of a strong kG field, which was undetected in our previous
low-resolution polarimetric observations with FORS1. A weak magnetic field was
detected in the circumstellar components of the Ca II H&K lines and the Na I D

dynamics in extended phase space, taking into account the distinctions between
General Relativity and other field theories. The formulation in extended phase
space leads to some consequences at classical and quantum levels. At the
classical level, it ensures that Hamiltonian dynamics is fully equivalent to
Lagrangian dynamics, and the algebra of Poisson brackets is invariant under
reparametrizations in a wide enough class including reparametrizations of gauge
variables, meantime in the canonical Dirac approach the constraints' algebra is
not invariant that creates problems with quantization. At the quantum level,
the approach come to the description in which the observer can see various but
complementary quantum gravitational phenomena in different reference frames

notorious open problem in parameterized complexity. Recently, this was settled
by the present authors (Kratsch and Wahlstr\""om, SODA 2012), with a randomized
polynomial kernel for the problem, using matroid theory to encode flow
questions over a set of terminals in size polynomial in the number of
terminals.
  In the current work we further establish the usefulness of matroid theory to
kernelization by showing applications of a result on representative sets due to
Lov\'asz (Combinatorial Surveys 1977) and Marx (TCS 2009). We show how
representative sets can be used to give a polynomial kernel for the elusive
Almost 2-SAT problem. We further apply the representative sets tool to the
problem of finding irrelevant vertices in graph cut problems, i.e., vertices
which can be made undeletable without affecting the status of the problem. This
gives the first significant progress towards a polynomial kernel for the
Multiway Cut problem; in particular, we get a kernel of O(k^{s+1}) vertices for
Multiway Cut instances with at most s terminals. Both these kernelization
results have significant spin-off effects, producing the first polynomial
kernels for a range of related problems.
  More generally, the irrelevant vertex results have implications for covering
min-cuts in graphs. For a directed graph G=(V,E) and sets S, T \subseteq V, let
r be the size of a minimum (S,T)-vertex cut (which may intersect S and T). We
can find a set Z \subseteq V of size O(|S|*|T|*r) which contains a minimum
(A,B)-vertex cut for every A \subseteq S, B \subseteq T. Similarly, for an
undirected graph G=(V,E), a set of terminals X \subseteq V, and a constant s,
we can find a set Z\subseteq V of size O(|X|^{s+1}) which contains a minimum
multiway cut for any partition of X into at most s pairwise disjoint subsets.

redshift quasars also show similar CO and H2O line properties, while starburst
galaxies, such as M82, lack these very strong H2O lines in the same wavelength
range, but do show strong CO lines. We explore the possibility of enhancing the
gas phase H2O abundance in X-ray exposed environments, using bare interstellar
carbonaceous dust grains as a catalyst. Cloud-cloud collisions cause C and J
shocks, and strip the grains of their ice layers. The internal UV field created
by X-rays from the accreting black hole does not allow to reform the ice. We
determine formation rates of both OH and H2O on dust grains, having temperature
T_dust=10-60 K, using both Monte Carlo as well as rate equation method
simulations. The acquired formation rates are added to our X-ray chemistry
code, that allows us to calculate the thermal and chemical structure of the
interstellar medium near an active galactic nucleus. We derive analytic
expressions for the formation of OH and H2O on bare dust grains as a catalyst.
Oxygen atoms arriving on the dust are released into the gas phase under the
form of OH and H2O. The efficiencies of this conversion due to the chemistry
occurring on dust are of order 30 percent for oxygen converted into OH and 60
percent for oxygen converted into H_2O between T_dust=15-40 K. At higher
temperatures, the efficiencies rapidly decline. When the gas is mostly atomic,
molecule formation on dust is dominant over the gas-phase route, which is then
quenched by the low H2 abundance. Here, it is possible to enhance the warm (T>
200 K) water abundance by an order of magnitude in X-ray exposed environments.
This helps to explain the observed bright water lines in nearby and
high-redshift ULIRGs and Quasars.

dimensional crossovers from the two dimensional system to one dimensional

hopping, which breaks the particle-hole symmetry and leads to a metallic phase
when it becomes dominant over the nearest-neighbor hopping. Furthermore, we
include weak repulsive on-site interactions and find the density profiles for
different values of the hopping parameters and interactions, both in a

  Optimization",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) were proposed, many
attempts have been made to improve EDAs' performance in the context of global
optimization. So far, the studies or applications of multivariate probabilistic
model based continuous EDAs are still restricted to rather low dimensional
problems (smaller than 100D). Traditional EDAs have difficulties in solving
higher dimensional problems because of the curse of dimensionality and their
rapidly increasing computational cost. However, scaling up continuous EDAs for
higher dimensional optimization is still necessary, which is supported by the
distinctive feature of EDAs: Because a probabilistic model is explicitly
estimated, from the learnt model one can discover useful properties or features
of the problem. Besides obtaining a good solution, understanding of the problem
structure can be of great benefit, especially for black box optimization. We
propose a novel EDA framework with Model Complexity Control (EDA-MCC) to scale
up EDAs. By using Weakly dependent variable Identification (WI) and Subspace
Modeling (SM), EDA-MCC shows significantly better performance than traditional
EDAs on high dimensional problems. Moreover, the computational cost and the
requirement of large population sizes can be reduced in EDA-MCC. In addition to
being able to find a good solution, EDA-MCC can also produce a useful problem
structure characterization. EDA-MCC is the first successful instance of
multivariate model based EDAs that can be effectively applied a general class
of up to 500D problems. It also outperforms some newly developed algorithms
designed specifically for large scale optimization. In order to understand the
strength and weakness of EDA-MCC, we have carried out extensive computational
studies of EDA-MCC. Our results have revealed when EDA-MCC is likely to
outperform others on what kind of benchmark functions.

orbital inclination i, the PA {\theta} that the orbital plane projection of the
line-of-sight makes with the apastron side of the semi-major axis, and the PA
on the sky of the orbital axis, we are able, for the first time, to tightly
constrain the absolute 3-D orientation of the binary orbit. To simultaneously
reproduce the blue-shifted emission arcs observed at orbital phase 0.976, STIS
slit PA = +38 degrees, and the temporal variations in emission seen at negative
slit PAs, the binary needs to have an i \approx 130 to 145 degrees, {\theta}
\approx -15 to +30 degrees, and an orbital axis projected on the sky at a PA
\approx 302 to 327 degrees east of north. This represents a system with an
orbital axis that is closely aligned with the inferred polar axis of the
Homunculus nebula, in 3-D. The companion star, Eta B, thus orbits clockwise on
the sky and is on the observer's side of the system at apastron. This

interpreting Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) it is crucial to determine the properties
of the EQuiTemporal Surfaces (EQTSs): the locus of points which are source of
radiation reaching the observer at the same arrival time. In the current
literature this analysis is performed only in the latest phases of the
afterglow. Here we study the distribution of the GRB bolometric luminosity over
the EQTSs, with special attention to the prompt emission phase. We analyze as
well the temporal evolution of the EQTS apparent size in the sky. We use the
analytic solutions of the equations of motion of the fireshell and the
corresponding analytic expressions of the EQTSs which have been presented in
recent works and which are valid for both the fully radiative and the adiabatic
dynamics. We find the novel result that at the beginning of the prompt emission
the most luminous regions of the EQTSs are the ones closest to the line of
sight. On the contrary, in the late prompt emission and in the early afterglow
phases the most luminous EQTS regions are the ones closest to the boundary of
the visible region. This transition in the emitting region may lead to specific
observational signatures, i.e. an anomalous spectral evolution, in the rising
part or at the peak of the prompt emission. We find as well an expression for
the apparent radius of the EQTS in the sky, valid in both the fully radiative

the coating molecules and that of the van der Waals interactions which favors
uniform tilt. We analyze the model for both spherical and octahedral particles.
On spherical particles, we find a transition from a tilted phase, at small
epsilon, to a phase where the molecules spontaneously align along the surface
normal and tilt disappears. Octahedral particles have an additional phase at
small epsilon characterized by the presence of six topological defects. These
defective configurations provide preferred sites for the chemical
functionalization of monolayer-protected nanoparticles via place-exchange
reactions and their consequent linking to form molecules and bulk materials.

leak some information, we focus on quantitative properties, which capture the
amount of information leaked by a protocol.
  The main contribution of this thesis is cpCTL, the first temporal logic that
allows for the specification and verification of conditional probabilities
(which are the key ingredient of most anonymity properties). In addition, we
have considered several prominent definitions of information-leakage and
developed the first algorithms allowing us to compute (and even approximate)
the information leakage of anonymity protocols according to these definitions.
We have also studied a well-known problem in the specification and analysis of
distributed anonymity protocols, namely full-information scheduling. To
overcome this problem, we have proposed an alternative notion of scheduling and
adjusted accordingly several anonymity properties from the literature. Our last
major contribution is a debugging technique that helps on the detection of
flaws in security protocols.

According to Einstein a photon is treated as a massless particle in the

universal parameter $c$, the photon velocity $c_{photon}$ and the phase
velocity of a light wave in vacuum $c_{wave}=\lambda\nu$. Due to the null
experiments of Michelson-Morley we have $c=c_{wave}$. The parameter
$c_{photon}$ is determined by the Noether charges corresponding to the
space-time symmetries of SR. In Einstein's Special Relativity (E-SR) we have
$c=c_{photon}$. In dS-SR, i.e. the Special Relativity with SO(4,1) de Sitter
space-time symmetry, we have $c_{photon}>c$. In this paper, the OPERA datum are
examined in the framework of dS-SR. We show that OPREA anomaly is in agreement
with the prediction of dS-SR with $R\simeq 1.95\times 10^{12}l.y.$ Based on the
$p$-$E$ relation of dS-SR, we also prove that the Cohen and Glashow's argument

conclude that OPERA and ICARUS results are consistent and they are explained in
