parity and charge-parity (PCP) violating varying alpha on the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) photon passing through the intra galaxy-cluster medium (ICM).
The ICM is well known to be composed of magnetized plasma. According to our
model, the polarization and intensity of the CMB would be affected when
traversing through the ICM due to non-trivial scalar photon interactions. We
have calculated the evolution of such polarization and intensity collectively,
known as the stokes parameters of the CMB photon during its journey through the
ICM and tested our results against the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) measurement on
Coma galaxy cluster. Our model contains a PCP violating parameter, $\beta$, and
a scale of alpha variation $\omega$. Using the derived constrained on the
photon-to-scalar conversion probability, ${\bar P}_{\gamma \rightarrow \phi}$,
for Coma cluster in ref.[34] we found a contour plot in the ($\omega,\beta$)
parameter plane. The $\beta =0$ line in this parameter space corresponds to
well-studied Maxwell-dilaton type models which has lower bound on $\omega
\gtrapprox 6.4 \times 10^{9}$ GeV. In general, as the absolute value of $\beta$
increases, lower bound on $\omega$ also increases. Our model in general
predicts the modification of the CMB polarization with a non-trivial dependence
on the parity violating coupling parameter $\beta$. However, it is
unconstrained in this particular study. We show that this effect can in
principle be detected in the future measurements on CMB polarization such that
$\beta$ can also be constrained.

emphasis on observability with current and near-future UV instrumentation. In
three transitions of interest (Lya, OVI and CIV) there is a clear bimodality in
the type of objects : the overwhelming majority of flux stems from discrete,
compact sources, while a much larger volume fraction is filled by more tenuous
gas. We characterise both object types with regard to number density, physical
size and shape, brightness, luminosity, velocity structure, mass, temperature,
ionisation state, and metal content. Degrading AMR grids to characteristic
resolutions of available (such as FIREBall) or foreseeable instrumentation,
allows to assess which inferences can be drawn from currently possible
observations, and set foundations to prepare observing strategies for future
missions. In general, the faint emission of the IGM and filamentary structure
remains beyond capabilities of instruments with only short duration exposure
potential (stratospheric balloons), even for optimistic assumptions for Lya,
while the yet fainter metal line transitions for these structures will remain
challenging for long duration exposures (space-based telescopes), mostly due to
low metallicity pushing them more than three orders of magnitudes in brightness
below Lya radiation. For the circum-galactic medium (CGM) the situation is more
promising, and it is foreseeable that in the near future we will not only just
dectect such sources, but the combination of all three lines in addition to
velocity information will yield valuable insight into the physical processes at

their backreaction onto the IGM from whence they formed. (abrigded)

features of the approach which make it different from the classical one are as
follows: (1) the study is nonasymptotic, that is, the sample size is fixed and
does not tend to infinity; (2) the parametric assumption is possibly
misspecified and the underlying data distribution can lie beyond the given
parametric family. These two features enable to bridge the gap between
parametric and nonparametric theory and to build a unified framework for
statistical estimation. The main results include large deviation bounds for the
(quasi) maximum likelihood and the local quadratic bracketing of the
log-likelihood process. The latter yields a number of important corollaries for
statistical inference: concentration, confidence and risk bounds, expansion of
the maximum likelihood estimate, etc. All these corollaries are stated in a
nonclassical way admitting a model misspecification and finite samples.
However, the classical asymptotic results including the efficiency bounds can
be easily derived as corollaries of the obtained nonasymptotic statements. At
the same time, the new bracketing device works well in the situations with
large or growing parameter dimension in which the classical parametric theory
fails. The general results are illustrated for the i.i.d. setup as well as for
generalized linear and median estimation. The results apply for any dimension
of the parameter space and provide a quantitative lower bound on the sample
size yielding the root-n accuracy.

investigated systematically by means of the inverse spin-Hall effect (ISHE) in
paramagnetic metals. The SSE generates a spin voltage as a result of a
temperature gradient in a ferromagnet, which injects a spin current into an
attached paramagnetic metal. In the paramagnet, this spin current is converted
into an electric field due to the ISHE, enabling the electric detection of the
SSE. The observation of the SSE is performed in longitudinal and transverse
configurations consisting of a ferromagnet/paramagnet hybrid structure, where
thermally generated spin currents flowing parallel and perpendicular to the
temperature gradient are detected, respectively. Our results explain the SSE in
terms of a two-step process: (1) the temperature gradient creates a
non-equilibrium state in the ferromagnet governed by both magnon and phonon
propagations and (2) the non-equilibrium between magnons in the ferromagnet and
electrons in the paramagnet at the contact interface leads to ""thermal spin
pumping"" and the ISHE signal. The non-equilibrium state of metallic magnets
(e.g. Ni81Fe19) under a temperature gradient is governed mainly by the phonons
in the sample and the substrate, while in insulating magnets (e.g. Y3Fe5O12)
both magnon and phonon propagations appear to be important. The phonon-mediated
non-equilibrium that drives the thermal spin pumping is confirmed also by
temperature-dependent measurements, giving rise to a giant enhancement of the
SSE signals at low temperatures.

the licensed spectrum without causing disruptive interference to the primary
users (PUs). One of the main challenges in CRNs is the ability to detect PU
transmissions. Recent works have suggested the use of secondary user (SU)
cooperation over individual sensing to improve sensing accuracy. In this paper,
we consider a CRN consisting of a single PU and multiple SUs to study the
problem of maximizing the total expected system throughput. We propose a
Bayesian decision rule based algorithm to solve the problem optimally with a
constant time complexity. To prioritize PU transmissions, we re-formulate the
throughput maximization problem by adding a constraint on the PU throughput.
The constrained optimization problem is shown to be NP-hard and solved via a
greedy algorithm with pseudo-polynomial time complexity that achieves strictly
greater than 1/2 of the optimal solution. We also investigate the case for
which a constraint is put on the sensing time overhead, which limits the number
of SUs that can participate in cooperative sensing. We reveal that the system
throughput is monotonic over the number of SUs chosen for sensing. We
illustrate the efficacy of the performance of our algorithms via a numerical
investigation.

understanding the effects introduced by uncertainties in the calibration of the

obtained during LIGO's fifth and Virgo's third science runs, which include
frequency-dependent amplitude errors of $\sim 10%$ and frequency-dependent
phase errors of $\sim 3$ degrees in each instrument. We quantify the
consequences of such errors estimating the parameters of inspiraling binaries.
We find that the systematics introduced by calibration errors on the inferred
values of the chirp mass and mass ratio are smaller than 20% of the statistical
measurement uncertainties in parameter estimation for 90% of signals in our
mock catalog. Meanwhile, the calibration-induced systematics in the inferred
sky location of the signal are smaller than $\sim 50%$ of the statistical

neutrinos travel at even tiny speeds above c, normal special relativity is
incomplete and any superluminal speed may be possible. I derive a limit on
superluminal neutrino speeds v >> c at high energies by noting that such speeds
would increase the size of the neutrino horizon. The increased volume of the
Universe visible leads to a brighter astrophysical neutrino background. The
nondetection of ""guaranteed"" neutrino backgrounds from star-forming galaxies
and ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) constrains v/c at TeV--ZeV energies.
I find that v/c <= 820 at 60 TeV from the nondetection of neutrinos from
star-forming galaxies. The nondetection of neutrinos from UHECRs constrains v/c
to be less than 2500 at 0.1 EeV in a pessimistic model and less than 4.6 at 4
EeV in an optimistic model. The UHECR neutrino background nondetection is
strongly inconsistent with a naive quadratic extrapolation of the OPERA results
to EeV energies. The limits apply subject to some caveats, particularly that
the expected pionic neutrino backgrounds exist and that neutrinos travel faster
than c when they pass the detector. They could be improved substantially as the
expected neutrino backgrounds are better understood and with new experimental
neutrino background limits. I also point out that extremely subluminal speeds
would result in a much smaller neutrino background intensity than expected.

the Sun. The Kozai effect can lead to changes in eccentricity and inclination
of the binary orbit, but it can be weakened or completely suppressed by other
sources of pericenter precession, such as the oblateness of the primary body.
Through numerical integrations including primary oblateness and 3 bodies (the
two binary components and the Sun), we show that Kozai cycles cannot occur for
the closely-separated near-Earth binaries in our sample. We demonstrate that
this is due to pericenter precession around the oblate primary, even for very
small oblateness values. Since the majority of observed near-Earth binaries are
not well-separated, we predict that Kozai cycles do not play an important role
in the orbital evolution of most near-Earth binaries. For a hypothetical wide
binary modeled after 1998 ST27, the separation is large at 16 primary radii and
so the orbital effects of primary oblateness are lessened. For this wide
binary, we illustrate the possible excursions in eccentricity and inclination
due to Kozai cycles as well as depict stable orientations for the binary's
orbital plane. Unstable orientations lead to collisions between binary
components, and we suggest that the Kozai effect acting in wide binaries may be
a route to the formation of near-Earth contact binaries.

in the compressed low-mass WD (M_WD < 0.9M_sun) in our model mimics those of a
Chandrasekhar mass WD. The spin-down luminosity from the QN compact remnant
(the quark star) provides additional power that makes the QN-Ia light-curve
brighter and broader than a standard SN-Ia with similar 56Ni yield. In QNe-Ia,
photometry and spectroscopy are not necessarily linked since the kinetic energy
of the ejecta has a contribution from spin-down power and nuclear decay.
Although QNe-Ia may not obey the Phillips relationship, their brightness and
their relatively ""normal looking"" light-curves means they could be included in
the cosmological sample. Light-curve fitters would be confused by the
discrepancy between spectroscopy at peak and photometry and would correct for
it by effectively brightening or dimming the QNe-Ia apparent magnitudes. Thus
over- or under-estimating the true magnitude of these spin-down powered SNe-Ia.
Contamination of QNe-Ia in samples of SNe-Ia used for cosmological analyses
could systematically bias measurements of cosmological parameters if QNe-Ia are
numerous enough at high-redshift. The strong mixing induced by spin-down wind
combined with the low 56Ni yields in QNe-Ia means that these would lack a
secondary maximum in the i-band despite their luminous nature. We discuss
possible QNe-Ia progenitors.

explain a class of short duration gamma-ray bursts. We study black hole-neutron
star mergers that occur with high eccentricity as may arise from dynamical
capture in dense stellar regions such as nuclear or globular clusters. We
perform general relativistic simulations of binaries with a range of impact
parameters, three different initial black hole spins (zero, aligned and
anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum), and neutron stars with three
different equations of state. We find a rich diversity across these parameters
in the resulting gravitational wave signals and matter dynamics, which should
also be reflected in the consequent electromagnetic emission. Before tidal
disruption, the gravitational wave emission is significantly larger than
perturbative predictions suggest for periapsis distances close to effective
innermost stable separations, exhibiting features reflecting the zoom-whirl
dynamics of the orbit there. Guided by the simulations, we develop a simple
model for the change in orbital parameters of the binary during close
encounters. Depending upon the initial parameters of the system, we find that
mass transfer during non-merging close encounters can range from essentially
zero to a sizable fraction of the initial neutron star mass. The same holds for
the amount of material outside the black hole post-merger, and in some cases
roughly half of this material is estimated to be unbound. We also see that
non-merging close encounters generically excite large oscillations in the
neutron star that are qualitatively consistent with f-modes.

function. The analysis is based on simulations of a cosmological volume.
Besides a Dark Matter (DM) only simulation, we also carry out two other
hydrodynamical simulations. We identified halos using a spherical overdensity
algorithm and their masses are computed at three different overdensities (with
respect to the critical one), $\Delta_c=200$, 500 and 1500. We find the
fractional difference between halo masses in the hydrodynamical and in the DM
simulations to be almost constant, at least for halos more massive than $\log
(M_{\Delta_c} / \hMsun)\geq 13.5$. In this range, mass increase in the
hydrodynamical simulations is of about 4-5 per cent at $\Delta_c=500$ and $\sim
1$ - 2 per cent at $\Delta_c=200$. Quite interestingly, these differences are
nearly the same for both radiative and non-radiative simulations. Such
variations of halo masses induce corresponding variations of the halo mass
function (HMF). At $z=0$, the HMFs for GH and CSF simulations are close to the
DM one, with differences of $\mincir 3$ per cent at $\Delta_c = 200$, and
$\simeq 7$ per cent at $\Delta_c=500$, with $\sim 10$ - 20 per cent differences
reached at $\Delta_c = 1500$. At this higher overdensity, the increase of the
HMF for the radiative case is larger by about a factor 2 with respect to the
non--radiative case. Assuming a constant mass shift to rescale the HMF from the
hydrodynamic to the DM simulations, brings the HMF difference with respect to
the DM case to be consistent with zero. Our results have interesting
implications to bracket uncertainties in the mass function calibration
associated to the uncertain baryon physics, in view of cosmological
applications of future large surveys of galaxy clusters. (Abridged)

magnetized star with a tilted dipole magnetic field, where the accretion is
driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). The simulations show that
MRI-driven turbulence develops in the disc, and angular momentum is transported
outwards due primarily to the magnetic stress. The turbulent flow is strongly
inhomogeneous and the densest matter is in azimuthally-stretched turbulent
cells. We investigate two regimes of accretion: a magnetospheric regime and a
boundary layer (BL) regime. In the magnetospheric regime, the accretion disc is
truncated by the star's magnetic field within a few stellar radii from the
star, and matter flows to the star in funnel streams. The funnel streams
flowing towards the south and north magnetic poles but are not equal due to the
inhomogeneity of the flow. In the BL regime, matter accretes to the surface of
the star through the boundary layer. The magnetic field in the inner disc is
strongly amplified by the shear of the accretion flow, and the matter and
magnetic stresses become comparable. Accreting matter forms a belt-shaped
region on the surface of the star. The belt has inhomogeneous density
distribution which varies in time due to variable accretion rate. Results of
simulations can be applied to classical T Tauri stars, accreting brown dwarfs,
millisecond pulsars, dwarf novae cataclysmic variables, and other stars with
magnetospheres smaller than several stellar radii.

  specific heat of various nonmagnetic intermetallic compounds",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The low-temperature normal-state specific heat and resistivity curves of
various nonmagnetic intermetallic compounds manifest an anomalous thermal
evolution. Such an anomaly is exhibited as a break in the slope of the
linearized C/T versus T^2 curve and as a drop in the R versus T curve, both at
the same T_{\beta}{\gamma}. It is related, not to a thermodynamic phase
transition, but to an anomaly in the density of states curves of the phonon or
electron subsystems. On representing these two anomalies as additional
Dirac-type delta functions, situated respectively at kB.{\theta}_L (for
lattice) and kB.{\theta}_E (for electrons), an analytical expression for the
total specific heat can be obtained. A least-square fit of this expression to
experimental specific heat curves of various compounds reproduced
satisfactorily all the features of the anomalous thermal evolution. The
obtained fit parameters (in particular the Sommerfeld constant, {\gamma}_{0},
and Debye temperatures, {\theta}_D, compare favorably with the reported values.
Furthermore, the analysis shows that (i) (T_{\beta}{\gamma}) / ({\theta}_D) =
0.2(1\pm1/\surd6) and (ii) {\gamma}_{0} {\propto} ({\theta}_D)^2; both
relations are in a reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Finally,
this analysis (based on the above arguments) justifies the often-used procedure
that treats the above anomaly in terms of either a thermal variation of
{\theta}_D or an additional Einstein mode.

re-distribution of anisotropic cosmic rays below about 100 TeV toward the

ab-initio} calculations [PRB {\bf 82}, 155446 (2010)] that an external electric
field can efficiently couple these two chiral spin states, even in the absence
of spin-orbit interaction (SOI). The SOI is nevertheless important, since it
introduces a splitting in the ground-state manifold via the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In this paper we present a theoretical study
of the effect of the SOI on the chiral states within spin density functional
theory. We employ a recently-introduced Hubbard model approach to elucidate the
connection between the SOI and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This
allows us to express the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction constant $D$ in
terms of the microscopic Hubbard model parameters, which we calculate from
first-principles. The small splitting that we find for the \{Cu$_3$\} chiral
state energies ($\Delta \approx 0.02$ meV) is consistent with experimental
results. The Hubbard model approach adopted here also yields a better estimate
of the isotropic exchange constant than the ones obtained by comparing total
energies of different spin configurations. The method used here for calculating
the DM interaction unmasks its simple fundamental origin which is the
off-diagonal spin-orbit interaction between the generally multireference vacuum
state and single-electron excitations out of those states.

weakens the secular gravitational instability and that the density-dependent
diffusion coefficient changes the growth rate. We apply the obtained results to
the turbulence driven by the shear instability and find that the secular

conditions can be answered by studying the temporal evolution of just one
special initial state. This special state thereby depends only on our knowledge

inequality for this state that can be used to determine whether mosts states of

thermalization times in systems with an effective light-cone and to quantum

condition for which a system never thermalizes, but remains close to its

follow power-law profiles, with exponent p and q respectively. We investigate
both the Epstein and the Stokes drag regimes which govern the motion of the

perturbation analysis. We compare these results with those from direct
numerical integration of the equations of motion. Then, using data from
observed discs, we predict the fate of dust grains in real discs. Results. When
a dust grain reaches the inner regions of the disc, the acceleration due to the
increase of the pressure gradient is counterbalanced by the increase of the gas

combines a Fokker--Planck description of short--timescale (daily) fluctuations
in sunspot number (\citeauthor{NobleEtAl2011}, 2011, \apj{} \textbf{732}, 5)
with information from other sources, such as precursor and/or dynamo models.
The forecasting is illustrated in application to two historical cycles (cycles
19 and 20), and then to the current solar cycle (cycle 24). The new method
allows the prediction of quantiles, i.e. the probability that the sunspot
number falls outside large or small bounds at a given future time. It also
permits Monte Carlo simulations to identify the expected size and timing of the
peak daily sunspot number, as well as the smoothed sunspot number for a cycle.
These simulations show how the large variance in daily sunspot number
determines the actual reliability of any forecast of the smoothed maximum of a
cycle. For cycle 24 we forecast a maximum daily sunspot number of $166\pm 24$,
to occur in March 2013, and a maximum value of the smoothed sunspot number of
$66\pm5$, indicating a very small solar cycle.

an effective 4.34 km resolution, and general flow field properties at an

radius of 50 km most favored and a likely range of 40 to 75 km. This is
consistent with our previous coarser (8.68 km resolution) simulations, implying
that we have achieved sufficient resolution in our determination of likely

suggest that a multiple ignition scenario is not likely. With improved
resolution, we can more clearly see the general flow pattern in the convective

recirculation. We show that the convective core is turbulent with a Kolmogorov
spectrum and has a lower turbulent intensity and larger integral length scale

version of the p-spin model, there are three (M=3) Ising spins on each site. At
mean-field level, this model is known to have two transitions; a dynamical
transition and a thermodynamic one at a lower temperature. The dynamical
transition is similar to the mode-coupling transition in glasses, while the
thermodynamic transition possibly describes what happens at the Kauzmann
temperature. We find that all the coupling constants in the model flow under
the MKA to the high-temperature sink implying that the mean-field features
disappear in three dimensions and that there is no transition in this model.
The behavior of the coupling constant flow is qualitatively similar to that of
the model with p=3 and M=2, for which only a single transition is predicted at

fluctuation effects completely remove all traces of their mean-field behavior.

hand, formal methods for verification of probabilistic real-time behavior have
reached a level of expressiveness and efficiency which allows to apply them in
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we suggest to employ the recently
introduced model of Interval Probabilistic Timed Automata (IPTA) for formal
verification of QoS properties of service-oriented systems. Specifically, we
show that IPTA in contrast to Probabilistic Timed Automata (PTA) are able to
capture the guarantees specified in SLAs directly. A particular challenge in
the analysis of IPTA is the fact that their naive semantics usually yields an
infinite set of states and infinitely-branching transitions. However, using
symbolic representations, IPTA can be analyzed rather efficiently. We have
developed the first implementation of an IPTA model checker by extending the
PRISM tool and show that model checking IPTA is only slightly more expensive
than model checking comparable PTA.

possibility of executions satisfying some temporal properties can be
quantitatively represented by the probabilistic extension of the path
quantifiers in their basic Computation Tree Logic (CTL), however, path formulae
of them are expressed via the same operators in CTL. For this reason, both of
them cannot represent formulae with quantitative temporal properties, such as
those of the form ""some properties hold to more than 80% of time points (in a
certain bounded interval) on the path."" In this paper, we introduce a new
temporal operator which expressed the notion of frequency of events, and define
probabilistic frequency temporal logic (PFTL) based on CTL\star. As a result,
we can easily represent the temporal properties of behavior in probabilistic
systems. However, it is difficult to develop a model checker for the full PFTL,
due to rich expressiveness. Accordingly, we develop a model-checking algorithm
for the CTL-like fragment of PFTL against finite-state Markov chains, and an
approximate model-checking algorithm for the bounded Linear Temporal Logic
(LTL) -like fragment of PFTL against countable-state Markov chains.

transposition tree $T$ on $n$ vertices. In an oft-cited paper
\cite{Akers:Krishnamurthy:1989} (see also \cite{Hahn:Sabidussi:1997}), it is
shown that the diameter of the Cayley graph $\Gamma$ is bounded as
$$\diam(\Gamma) \le \max_{\pi \in S_n}{c(\pi)-n+\sum_{i=1}^n
\dist_T(i,\pi(i))},$$ where the maximization is over all permutations $\pi$,
$c(\pi)$ denotes the number of cycles in $\pi$, and $\dist_T$ is the distance
function in $T$. In this work, we first assess the performance (the sharpness
and strictness) of this upper bound. We show that the upper bound is sharp for
all trees of maximum diameter and also for all trees of minimum diameter, and
we exhibit some families of trees for which the bound is strict. We then show
that for every $n$, there exists a tree on $n$ vertices, such that the
difference between the upper bound and the true diameter value is at least
$n-4$.
  Observe that evaluating this upper bound requires on the order of $n!$ (times
a polynomial) computations. We provide an algorithm that obtains an estimate of
the diameter, but which requires only on the order of (polynomial in) $n$
computations; furthermore, the value obtained by our algorithm is less than or
equal to the previously known diameter upper bound. This result is possible
because our algorithm works directly with the transposition tree on $n$
vertices and does not require examining any of the permutations (only the proof
requires examining the permutations). For all families of trees examined so
far, the value $\beta$ computed by our algorithm happens to also be an upper
bound on the diameter, i.e.
  $$\diam(\Gamma) \le \beta \le \max_{\pi \in S_n}{c(\pi)-n+\sum_{i=1}^n

uniqueness results of local medians are given. In order to compute medians in
practical cases, we propose a subgradient algorithm and prove its convergence.
After that, Fr\'echet medians are considered. We prove their statistical
consistency and give some quantitative estimations of their robustness with the
aid of upper curvature bounds. We also show that, in compact Riemannian
manifolds, the Fr\'echet medians of generic data points are always unique.
Stochastic and deterministic algorithms are proposed for computing Riemannian
p-means. The rate of convergence and error estimates of these algorithms are
also obtained. Finally, we apply the medians and the Riemannian geometry of
Toeplitz covariance matrices to radar target detection.

recognition of named entities and annotation of personal information about

Then we built a second cascade to annote the designating entities, i.e.

present in nature interact with the universal vacuum in a polarisable
dielectric representation through two uniquely defined vacuum potential
functions. All of the non-composite subatomic particles containing one-unit
charges, +e or -e, are therefore formed in terms of the IED model of the
respective charges, of zero rest masses, oscillating in either of the two
unique vacuum potential fields, together with the radiation waves of their own
charges. In this paper we give a first principles treatment of the dynamics of
charge in a dielectric vacuum, based on which, combined with solutions for the
radiation waves obtained previously, we subsequently derive the vacuum
potential function for a given charge q, which we show to be quadratic and
consist each of quantised potential levels, giving therefore rise to quantised
characteristic oscillation frequencies of the charge and accordingly quantised,
sharply-defined masses of the IED particles. By further combining with relevant
experimental properties as input information, we determine the IED particles
built from the charges +e,-e at their first excited states in the respective
vacuum potential wells to be the proton and the electron, the observationally
two only stable (permanently lived) and ""free"" particles containing one-unit

determined. The characteristics of all of the other more energetic
non-composite subatomic particles can also be recognised. We finally discuss
the energy condition for pair production, which requires two successive energy
supplies to (1) first disintegrate the bound pair of vaculeon charges +e,-e
composing a vacuuon of the vacuum and (2) impart masses to the disintegrated

the appropriate physics is the coefficient of the interband scattering
$R_{12}$. For small $R_{12}$ the superconducting order parameter is only
suppressed to some extent near the surface for the both bands. For intermediate
and strong interband scattering there are two possible non-trivial surface
states of the order parameter: (i) purely real solution, where the symmetry of
the superconducting state near the surface is changed from $s_{\pm}$ to
conventional $s_{++}$ and (ii) time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRB) state. In
this state the order parameters in the two bands acquire phases $\phi_{1,2}(x)

the TRB surface state can be more energetically favorable than the $s_{\pm} \to

up to $T_c$ only the TR state can exist. The transition between the two

subject to a punishing impact regime that would greatly hinder the development
of life. Here, we present the 4th in a series of studies investigating this
hypothesis. Previously, we examined the effect of Jupiter's mass on the impact
rate experienced by Earth. Here, we extend that approach to consider the
influence of Jupiter's orbital eccentricity and inclination on the impact rate.
  We first consider scenarios in which Jupiter's orbital eccentricity was
somewhat higher and somewhat lower than that in our Solar System. We find that
Jupiter's orbital eccentricity plays a moderate role in determining the impact
flux at Earth, with more eccentric orbits resulting in a higher impact rate of
asteroids than for more circular orbits. This is particularly pronounced at
high ""Jupiter"" masses. For short-period comets, the same effect is clearly
apparent, albeit to a lesser degree. The flux of short-period comets impacting
the Earth is slightly higher for more eccentric Jovian orbits.
  We also consider scenarios in which Jupiter's orbital inclination was greater
than that in our Solar System. Increasing Jupiter's orbital inclination greatly
increased the flux of asteroidal impactors. However, at the highest tested
inclination, the disruption to the Asteroid belt was so great that the belt
would be entirely depleted after an astronomically short period of time. In
such a system, the impact flux from asteroid bodies would therefore be very
low, after an initial period of intense bombardment. By contrast, the influence
of Jovian inclination on impacts from short-period comets was very small. A
slight reduction in the impact flux was noted for the moderate and high
inclination scenarios considered in this work - the results for inclinations of
five and twenty-five degrees were essentially identical.

three-dimensional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code by Meru and Bate,
have been interpreted as implying that three-dimensional global discs fragment
much more easily than would be expected from a two-dimensional local model.
Subsequently, global and local two-dimensional models have been shown to
display similar fragmentation properties, leaving it unclear whether the
three-dimensional results reflect a physical effect or a numerical problem
associated with the treatment of cooling or artificial viscosity in SPH. Here,
we study how fragmentation of self-gravitating disc flows in SPH depends upon
the implementation of cooling. We run disc simulations that compare a simple
cooling scheme, in which each particle loses energy based upon its internal
energy per unit mass, with a method in which the cooling is derived from a
smoothed internal energy density field. For the simple per particle cooling
scheme, we find a significant increase in the minimum cooling time scale for
fragmentation with increasing resolution, matching previous results. Switching
to smoothed cooling, however, results in lower critical cooling time scales,
and tentative evidence for convergence at the highest spatial resolution
tested. We conclude that precision studies of fragmentation using SPH require
careful consideration of how cooling (and, probably, artificial viscosity) is
implemented, and that the apparent non-convergence of the fragmentation
boundary seen in prior simulations is likely a numerical effect. In real discs,
where cooling is physically smoothed by radiative transfer effects, the
fragmentation boundary is probably displaced from the two-dimensional value by
a factor that is only of the order of unity.

cosmology. However, its estimation from full-sky surveys such as WMAP or more
recently Planck is challenging: CMB maps are generally estimated via the
application of some source separation techniques which never prevent the final
map from being contaminated with noise and foreground residuals. These spurious
contaminations whether noise or foreground residuals are well-known to be a
plague for most cosmologically relevant tests or evaluations; this includes CMB
lensing reconstruction or non-Gaussian signatures search. Noise reduction is
generally performed by applying a simple Wiener filter in spherical harmonics;
however this does not account for the non-stationarity of the noise. Foreground
contamination is usually tackled by masking the most intense residuals detected
in the map, which makes CMB evaluation harder to perform. In this paper, we
introduce a novel noise reduction framework coined LIW-Filtering for Linear
Iterative Wavelet Filtering which is able to account for the noise spatial
variability thanks to a wavelet-based modeling while keeping the highly desired
linearity of the Wiener filter. We further show that the same filtering
technique can effectively perform foreground contamination reduction thus
providing a globally cleaner CMB map. Numerical results on simulated but
realistic Planck data are provided.

theorem of Yannakakis that established a connection between polyhedral lifts of

The implementation of finite temperature, which spontaneously breaks
supersymmetry, induces an effective potential at one loop level. At the points
where extra massless states appear in the string spectrum, the potential
develops local minima whose depth depends on the temperature. Moduli attracted
to these points acquire dynamical masses which decrease with cosmological
evolution. This makes the coherent scalar oscillations dilute before
nucleosynthesis, and the cosmological moduli problem is avoided. In particular,
we study the effective potential induced by a maximally supersymmetric
heterotic string gas for spacetime dimension D>=4, and a gas of type II strings
compactified on Calabi-Yau three-folds (D=4). In the former case, the local
minima of the potential arise at enhanced gauge symmetry points, which can
stabilize all moduli but the dilaton. In the latter case, the local minima are
reached at the loci where 2-cycles or 3-cycles in the Calabi-Yau space shrink
to zero size, accompanied with either conifold transitions or non Abelian gauge
symmetries. This stabilizes the type II moduli which characterize the
deformation of these shrinking cycles. Moduli stabilization in the dual string
models is also investigated by heterotic/type I S-dualities and type
II/heterotic dualities.

propagating in curved spacetime is investigated and a generalisation of the
optical theorem to curved spacetime is proved. In the case of QED, the
interaction of tidal forces with the vacuum polarization cloud of virtual e^+
e^- pairs dressing the renormalized photon has been shown to produce several
novel phenomena. In particular, the photon field amplitude can locally increase
as well as decrease, corresponding to a negative imaginary part of the
refractive index, in apparent violation of unitarity and the optical theorem.
Below threshold decays into e^+ e^- pairs may also occur. In this paper, these
issues are studied from the point of view of a non-equilibrium initial-value
problem, with the field evolution from an initial null surface being calculated
for physically distinct initial conditions and for both scalar field theories
and QED. It is shown how a generalised version of the optical theorem, valid in
curved spacetime, allows a local increase in amplitude while maintaining
consistency with unitarity. The picture emerges of the field being dressed and
undressed as it propagates through curved spacetime, with the local
gravitational tidal forces determining the degree of dressing and hence the
amplitude of the renormalized quantum field. These effects are illustrated with
many examples, including a description of the undressing of a photon in the
vicinity of a black hole singularity.

neutrino oscillation data analyses as well as will be reported in this work,
and quite recently by the Double Chooz experiment. However, as we enter the era
of precision neutrino oscillation experiments, terms linear in
$\sin\theta_{13}$ will no longer be negligible, and its sign would affect the
extraction of other oscillation parameters. The sign of $\sin\theta_{13}$ also
plays a crucial role in the determination of the CP-violating phase. In this
work we show that by adopting an alternative parametrization for the
Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) mixing matrix, one already has a chance
to infer the sign of each mixing angle in the conventional parametrization
using existing global neutrino data. A weak preference for negative $\sin
\theta_{13}$ is found. In particular, the solar data suggest that
$\sin\theta_{13} > 0$ while all other data the opposite. This leads to the
speculation on whether the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect is
responsible. In this work we found that in the new mixing matrix
parametrization, the 68% CL constraints on the three mixing angles are
comparable to those estimated in the conventional parametrization adopted in
the literature. Owing to the strong correlations among the three mixing angles
in the new parametrization, the advantages of doing the global neutrino
oscillation analysis using data from past, current, and near future neutrino
oscillation experiments shall become manifest.

processes has been extensively studied in the last decade. Important results
that partially answer this question show a weak connection between the
macroscopic behavior of these processes and specific structural properties in
the network, such as the largest eigenvalue of a topology related matrix.
However, little is known about the direct influence of the network topology on
microscopic level, such as the influence of the (neighboring) network on the
probability of a particular node's infection. To answer this question, we
derive both an upper and a lower bound for the probability that a particular
node is infective in a susceptible-infective-susceptible model for two cases of
spreading processes: reactive and contact processes. The bounds are derived by
considering the $n-$hop neighborhood of the node; the bounds are tighter as one
uses a larger $n-$hop neighborhood to calculate them. Consequently, using local
information for different neighborhood sizes, we assess the extent to which the
topology influences the spreading process, thus providing also a strong
macroscopic connection between the former and the latter. Our findings are
complemented by numerical results for a real-world e-mail network. A very good
estimate for the infection density $\rho$ is obtained using only 2-hop
neighborhoods which account for 0.4% of the entire network topology on average.

at 1089.6 nm with the TIP and 617.3 nm with the GFPI spectropolarimeters along
with broad-band images using G-band and CaIIK filters at the German VTT. The
formation of the penumbra is intimately related to the inclined magnetic field.
Within 4.5 h observing time, the magnetic flux of the penumbra increases from
9.7E+20 to 18.2E+20 Mx, while the magnetic flux of the umbra remains constant
at about 3.8E+20 Mx. Magnetic flux in the immediate surroundings is
incorporated into the spot, and new flux is supplied via small flux patches
(SFPs), which on average have a flux of 2-3E+18 Mx. The spot's flux increase
rate of 4.2E+16 Mx/s corresponds to the merging of one SFP per minute. We also
find that during the formation of the spot penumbra: a) the maximum magnetic
field strength of the umbra does not change, b) the magnetic neutral line keeps
the same position relative to the umbra, c) the new flux arrives on the
emergence side of the spot while the penumbra forms on the opposite side, d)
the average LRF inclination of the light bridges decreases from 50 to 37 deg,
and e) as the penumbra develops, the mean magnetic field strength at the spot
border decreases from 1.0 to 0.8 kG. The SFPs associated with elongated
granules are the building blocks of structure formation in active regions.
During the sunspot formation, their contribution is comparable to the
coalescence of pores. A quiet environment in the surroundings is important for
penumbral formation. As remnants of trapped granulation between merging pores,
the light bridges are found to play a crucial role in the formation process.
They seem to channel the magnetic flux through the spot during its formation.
Light bridges are also the locations where the first penumbral filaments form.

on the random-variable formalism of anomalous diffusive processes. We find that
the empirical trapping-reaction law, according to which the reactant
concentration decreases in time as a product of an exponential and a stretched
exponential function, can be explained by the two-time scale subordination of
random processes. Another example is connected with a state equation for
continuous media with memory. If the pressure and the density of a medium are
subordinated in two different random processes, then the ordinary state
equation becomes fractional with two time scales. This allows one to arrive at
the state equation of Bagley-Torvik type.

image of an observed bright star by attenuating the diffraction effects caused
by the telescope aperture of diameter D. The Dual Zone Phase Mask (DZPM)
coronagraph constitutes a promising concept since it theoretically offers a
small inner working angle (IWA \sim \lambda_0/D), good achromaticity and high
starlight rejection, typically reaching a 1e6 contrast at 5 \lambda_0/D from
the star over a spectral bandwidth \Delta\lambda/\lambda_0 of 25% (similar to
H-band). This last value proves to be encouraging for broadband imaging of
young and warm Jupiter-like planets. Contrast levels higher than 1e6 are
however required for the observation of older and/or less massive companions
over a finite spectral bandwidth. An achromatization improvement of the DZPM
coronagraph is therefore mandatory to reach such performance. In its design,
the DZPM coronagraph uses a grey (or achromatic) apodization. We propose to
replace it by a colored apodization to increase the performance of this
coronagraphic system over a large spectral range. This innovative concept,
called Colored Apodizer Phase Mask (CAPM) coronagraph, is defined with some
design parameters optimized to reach the best contrast in the exoplanet search
area. Once this done, we study the performance of the CAPM coronagraph in the
presence of different errors to evaluate the sensitivity of our concept. A 2.5
mag contrast gain is estimated from the performance provided by the CAPM
coronagraph with respect to that of the DZPM coronagraph. A 2.2e-8 intensity
level at 5 \lambda_0/D separation is then theoretically achieved with the CAPM
coronagraph in the presence of a clear circular aperture and a 25% bandwidth.
In addition, our studies show that our concept is less sensitive to low than
high-order aberrations for a given value of rms wavefront errors.

emission from the central region, close to the Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH).
For this reason, the study of deep X-ray spectra is a powerful instrument to
investigate the origin of their emission.
  The emission line most often observed in the X-ray spectra of AGN is Fe K. It
is known that it can be broadened and deformed by relativistic effects if
emitted close enough to the central SMBH. In recent statistical studies of the
X-ray spectra of AGN samples, it is found that a narrow Fe line is ubiquitous,
while whether the broad features are as common is still uncertain. We present
here the results of an investigation on the characteristics of the Fe line in
the average X-ray spectra of AGN in deep Chandra fields.
  The average spectrum of the AGN is computed using Chandra spectra with more
than 200 net counts from the AEGIS, Chandra Deep Field North and Chandra Deep
Field South surveys. The sample spans a broader range of X-ray luminosities
than other samples studied with stacking methods up to z=3.5. We analyze the
average spectra of this sample using our own averaging method, checking the
results against extensive simulations. Subsamples defined in terms of column
density of the local absorber, luminosity and z are also investigated.
  We found a very significant Fe line with a narrow profile in all our samples
and in almost all the subsamples that we constructed. The equivalent width (EW)
of the narrow line estimated in the average spectrum of the full sample is 74
eV. The broad line component is significantly detected in the subsample of AGN
with L<1.43 1E44 cgs and z<0.76, with EW=108 eV.
  We concluded that the narrow Fe line is an ubiquitous feature of the X-ray

because any nontrivial prior leads to an intractable posterior density.
However, if a conditionally conjugate prior density is adopted, then there is a
simple Gibbs sampler that can be employed to explore the posterior density. A
popular default among the conditionally conjugate priors is an improper prior
that takes a product form with a flat prior on the regression parameter, and
so-called power priors on each of the variance components. In this paper, a
convergence rate analysis of the corresponding Gibbs sampler is undertaken. The
main result is a simple, easily-checked sufficient condition for geometric
ergodicity of the Gibbs-Markov chain. This result is close to the best possible
result in the sense that the sufficient condition is only slightly stronger
than what is required to ensure posterior propriety. The theory developed in
this paper is extremely important from a practical standpoint because it
guarantees the existence of central limit theorems that allow for the
computation of valid asymptotic standard errors for the estimates computed

derive a mass scale below which collapsed structures are relatively devoid of
baryons. We examine how the inclusion of a chameleon scalar field affects this
baryonic Jeans mass, bearing in mind both the canonical case of a
gravitational-strength coupling between the scalar field and matter, as well as
the strong coupling regime wherein the coupling is very large. We find that
baryon effects persist down to smaller scales in a chameleon theory than they
do in ordinary general relativity, especially in the case of strong coupling.
Several potentially observable consequences of this are identified.

distributed ""normal"" condensate with fluctuations scaling as $1/\sqrt{V}$, and
a non Gaussian distributed ""anomalous"" condensate. A detailed analysis of the
anomalous condensate is performed for a one-dimensional system ($d=1$).
Extending this one-dimensional analysis to exactly the point of transition

the high resistivity of the sample (two orders of magnitude larger than bulk

of S is in agreement with the values obtained from electronic structure
calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory within the constant

state of the data qubit around the z-axis of the Bloch sphere with the angle of
rotation being fully determined by the state of the program qubit. The gate
implementation is based on fiber optics components. Qubits are encoded into
spatial modes of single photons. The signal from the feed-forward detector is
led directly to a phase modulator using only a passive voltage divider. We have
verified the increase of the success probability and characterized the gate
operation by means of quantum process tomography. We have demonstrated that the

by CoGeNT is best explained by the dark matter (DM) hypothesis from a Bayesian

for the data: no modulation signal, modulation due to DM, modulation due to DM
compatible with the total CoGeNT rate, and a signal coming from other physics
with a free phase but annual period, or with a free phase and a free period. In
each scenario, we assign to the free parameters physically motivated priors. We
find that while the DM models are weakly preferred to the no modulation model,
but when compared to models where the modulation is due to other physics, the
DM hypothesis is favoured with odds ranging from 185:1 to 560:1. This result is
robust even when astrophysical uncertainties are taken into account and the
impact of priors assessed. Interestingly, the odds for the DM model in which
the modulation signal is compatible with the total rate against a DM model in
which this prior is not implemented is only 5:8, in spite of the former's
prediction of a modulation amplitude in the energy range 0.9 to 3.0 keVee that
is significantly smaller than the value observed by CoGeNT. Classical
hypothesis testing also rules out the null hypothesis of no modulation at the
1.6 sigma to 2.3 sigma level, depending on the details of the alternative.
Lastly, we investigate whether anisotropic velocity distributions can help to
mitigate the tension between the CoGeNT total and modulated rates, and find
encouraging results.

compression is represented by straight-line programs (SLPs), i.e. a
context-free grammars generating exactly one string; the term fully means that
both the pattern and the text are given in the compressed form. The problem is
approached using a recently developed technique of local recompression: the
SLPs are refactored, so that substrings of the pattern and text are encoded in
both SLPs in the same way. To this end, the SLPs are locally decompressed and
then recompressed in a uniform way.
  This technique yields an O((n+m)log M) algorithm for compressed pattern
matching, assuming that M fits in O(1) machine words, where n (m) is the size
of the compressed representation of the text (pattern, respectively), while M
is the size of the decompressed pattern. If only m+n fits in O(1) machine

that interfacial failure can be mediated by slow slip rupture phenomena which
are distinct from ordinary, earthquake-like, fast rupture. These discoveries
have influenced the way we think about frictional motion, yet the nature and
properties of slow rupture are not completely understood. We show that slow
rupture is an intrinsic and robust property of simple non-monotonic
rate-and-state friction laws. It is associated with a new velocity scale
$c_{min}$, determined by the friction law, below which steady state rupture
cannot propagate. We further show that rupture can occur in a continuum of
states, spanning a wide range of velocities from $c_{min}$ to elastic
wave-speeds, and predict different properties for slow rupture and ordinary
fast rupture. Our results are qualitatively consistent with recent
high-resolution laboratory experiments and may provide a theoretical framework
for understanding slow rupture phenomena along frictional interfaces.

  7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"hep-ph hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The question of the exact nature of the phase transition in two-flavor QCD is
still under discussion. Recent results for small quark masses in simulations
with 2+1 flavors show scaling behavior consistent with the O(4) or O(2)
universality class. For a precise determination, an assessment of deviations
from the ideal scaling behavior due to finite quark masses and finite
simulation volumes is necessary.
  We study the scaling behavior at the chiral phase transition with an
effective quark-meson model. In our Renormalization Group approach, the quark
masses in the model can be varied from the chiral limit over a wide range of
values, which allows us to estimate scaling deviations due to large quark
masses and the extent of the scaling region. We conclude that scaling
deviations are already large at pion masses of 75 MeV, but that the effect is
difficult to see in the absence of results for even smaller masses. Comparing
results only in a narrow window of pion masses leads to the observation of
apparent scaling behavior. While the scaling deviations are not necessarily
universal, we expect that this may affect current lattice simulation results.
  By placing the system in a finite box, we investigate the transition between
infinite-volume scaling behavior and finite-size scaling. We estimate that
finite-size scaling behavior can be tested in regions where pion mass times box
size is approximately 2 - 3, which is smaller than in most current lattice
simulations. We expect that finite-volume effects are small for pion masses of
75 MeV and lattice aspect ratios with TL > 8, but that they will become
significant when pion masses in lattice simulations become smaller.

in 2D space perturbed by static disorder that is invariant under a chiral
symmetry (chS) and a time-reversal symmetry (TRS) operation which, when
squared, is equal either to plus or minus the identity. The former TRS
(symmetry class BDI) can for example be realized when the Dirac fermions emerge
from spinless fermions hopping on a 2D lattice with a linear energy dispersion
such as the honeycomb lattice (graphene) or the square lattice with $\pi$-flux
per plaquette. The latter TRS is realized by the surface states of 3D
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-topological band insulators in symmetry class CII. In the
phase diagram parametrized by the disorder strengths, there is an infrared
stable line of critical points for both symmetry classes BDI and CII. Here we
discuss a ""global phase diagram"" in which disordered Dirac fermion systems in
all three chiral symmetry classes, AIII, CII, and BDI, occur in 4 quadrants,
sharing one corner which represents the clean Dirac fermion limit. This phase
diagram also includes symmetry classes AII [e.g., appearing at the surface of a
disordered 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological band insulator in the spin-orbit
(symplectic) symmetry class] and D (e.g., the random bond Ising model in two
dimensions) as boundaries separating regions of the phase diagram belonging to
the three chS classes AIII, BDI, and CII. Moreover, we argue that physics of
Anderson localization in the CII phase can be presented in terms of a
non-linear-sigma model (NLsM) with a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-topological term. We
thereby complete the derivation of topological or Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten
terms in the NLsM description of disordered fermionic models in all 10 symmetry
classes relevant to Anderson localization in two spatial dimensions.
