to a rotor model which exhibits an inverse cascade by the formation of rotor
clusters. A rotor is composed of two vortices with like-signed circulations
glued together by an overdamped spring. The model is motivated by a treatment
of the vorticity equation representing the vorticity field as a superposition
of vortices with elliptic Gaussian shapes of variable widths, augmented by a
suitable forcing mechanism. The rotor model opens up the way to discuss the
energy transport in the inverse cascade on the basis of dynamical systems
theory.

two compact stars (either black holes or neutron stars) is initially highly
deformed but soon settles down to a quiescent state by emitting a superposition
of quasi-normal modes (QNMs). The QNMs are damped sinusoids with characteristic
frequencies and decay times that depend only on the mass and spin of the black
hole and no other parameter - a statement of the no-hair theorem. In this paper
we have examined the extent to which QNMs could be used to test the no-hair
theorem with future ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors. We
model departures from general relativity (GR) by introducing extra parameters
which change the mode frequencies or decay times from their general
relativistic values. With the aid of numerical simulations and Bayesian model
selection, we assess the extent to which the presence of such a parameter could
be inferred, and its value estimated. We find that it is harder to decipher the
departure of decay times from their GR value than it is with the mode
frequencies. Einstein Telescope (ET, a third generation ground-based detector)
could detect departures of <1% in the frequency of the dominant QNM mode of a
500 Msun black hole, out to a maximum range of 4 Gpc. In contrast, the New
Gravitational Observatory (NGO, an ESA space mission to detect gravitational
waves) can detect departures of ~ 0.1% in a 10^8 Msun black hole to a

minimizing several volume integrals which would vanish for an exact

part of the optimization procedure. Only the metric is involved in the
procedure, no assumptions about the origin of the energy-momentum tensor are
needed. A scale factor does not show up during the optimization process, the
optimal scale factor is determined at the end. The general formulation is non
perturbative. An explicit perturbative treatment is possible. The shifts which
lead to the optimal coordinates obey Euler-Lagrange equations which are
formulated and solved in first order of the perturbation. The extension to
second order is sketched, but turns out to be unnecessary. The only freedom in
the choice of coordinates which finally remains are the rigid transformations
which keep the form of the Robertson-Walker metric intact, i.e. translations in
space and time, spatial rotations, and spatial scaling. Spatial averaging
becomes trivial. In first order of the perturbation there is no backreaction. A
simplified second order treatment results in a very small effect, excluding the
possibility to mimic dark energy from backreaction. This confirms (as well as
contradicts) statements in the literature.

is to construct solutions to the steady problem for the Boltzmann equation in a
general bounded domain with diffuse reflection boundary conditions
corresponding to a non isothermal temperature of the wall. Denoted by \delta
the size of the temperature oscillations on the boundary, we develop a theory
to characterize such a solution mathematically. We construct a unique solution
F_s to the Boltzmann equation, which is dynamically asymptotically stable with
exponential decay rate. Moreover, if the domain is convex and the temperature
of the wall is continuous we show that F_s is continuous away from the grazing
set. If the domain is non-convex, discontinuities can form and then propagate
along the forward characteristics. We show that they actually form for a
suitable smooth temperature profile. We remark that this solution differs from
a local equilibrium Maxwellian, hence it is a genuine non equilibrium
stationary solution. Our analysis is based on recent studies of the boundary
value problems for the Boltzmann equation but with new constructive coercivity
estimates for both steady and dynamic cases. A natural question in this setup
is to determine if the general Fourier law, stating that the heat conduction
vector q is proportional to the temperature gradient, is valid. As an
application of our result we establish an expansion in \delta for F_s whose
first order term F_1 satisfies a linear, parameter free equation. Consequently,
we discover that if the Fourier law were valid for F_s, then the temperature of
F_1 must be linear in a slab. Such a necessary condition contradicts available
numerical simulations, leading to the prediction of break-down of the Fourier
law in the kinetic regime.

problem is based on the Back-Projection Formula. This formula gives an
analytical inversion of the Radon transform, provided that all the values of Rf
are known. In applications only a discrete set of values of Rf is given, thus,
one can only obtain an approximation of f. Another class of methods, called
ART, can be used to solve the reconstruction problem. Following the ideas
contained in ART, we try to apply the Hermite-Birkhoff interpolation to the
reconstruction problem. It turns out that, since the Radon transform of a
kernel basis function can be infinity, a regularization technique is needed.

algorithms performing message-passing on a probabilistic graph, such as the

  In this contribution, we apply a combined VMP-SP message-passing technique to
the design of receivers for MIMO-ODFM systems. The message-passing equations of
the combined scheme can be obtained from the equations of the stationary points
of a constrained region-based free energy approximation. When applied to a
MIMO-OFDM probabilistic model, we obtain a generic receiver architecture
performing iterative channel weight and noise precision estimation,
equalization and data decoding. We show that this generic scheme can be
particularized to a variety of different receiver structures, ranging from
high-performance iterative structures to low complexity receivers. This allows
for a flexible design of the signal processing specially tailored for the
requirements of each specific application. The numerical assessment of our
solutions, based on Monte Carlo simulations, corroborates the high performance
of the proposed algorithms and their superiority to heuristic approaches.

such that the orbifold singularities correspond to the zeros of their
homogeneous coordinates. The individual orbifold singularities are resolved
using a GLSM guise of non-compact toric resolutions, i.e. replacing discrete
orbifold actions by Abelian worldsheet gaugings. Given that we employ the same
global coordinates for both the toroidal orbifold and its resolutions, our GLSM
formalism confirms the gluing procedure on the level of divisors discussed by
Lust et al. Using our global GLSM description we can study the moduli space of
such toroidal orbifolds as a whole. In particular, changes in topology can be
described as phase transitions of the underlying GLSM. Finally, we argue that
certain partially resolvable GLSMs, in which a certain number of fixed points
can never be resolved, might be useful for the study of mini-landscape orbifold
MSSMs.

a relationship between irradiation level and planet dayside temperature, as
discussed by Knutson et al. (2010) and Cowan & Agol (2011), respectively. Our

suggest that the cluster may be the nucleus of a former gas-rich satellite
galaxy undergoing tidal disruption by NGC 4449. If so, the cluster is seen in

simulation-based recursive algorithms for the approximation of the a posteriori
probability measures generated by state-space dynamical models. At any given
time $t$, a SMC method produces a set of samples over the state space of the
system of interest (often termed ""particles"") that is used to build a discrete
and random approximation of the posterior probability distribution of the state
variables, conditional on a sequence of available observations. One potential
application of the methodology is the estimation of the densities associated to
the sequence of a posteriori distributions. While practitioners have rather
freely applied such density approximations in the past, the issue has received
less attention from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we address the
problem of constructing kernel-based estimates of the posterior probability
density function and its derivatives, and obtain asymptotic convergence results
for the estimation errors. In particular, we find convergence rates for the
approximation errors that hold uniformly on the state space and guarantee that
the error vanishes almost surely as the number of particles in the filter
grows. Based on this uniform convergence result, we first show how to build
continuous measures that converge almost surely (with known rate) toward the
posterior measure and then address a few applications. The latter include
maximum a posteriori estimation of the system state using the approximate
derivatives of the posterior density and the approximation of functionals of
it, for example, Shannon's entropy.

derive strong detection criteria that can be directly evaluated for

are predicted in a large variety of non-linear systems. Motivated by the
conceptual bridging of the DBs phenomena in classical and quantum mechanical
representation, we study their signatures in the dynamics of a quantum
equivalent of a classical mechanical point in a phase space -- a coherent
state. We show that in contrast to a point in a phase space that can exhibit
either delocalized or localized motion, a coherent state can show signatures of
a quantum equivalent of both localized and delocalized behavior. In classical
mechanics, the separation between the energy regions of localized and
delocalized motion is a point. In quantum mechanics, this point becomes a
transient region, in which both tunneling and non-tunneling modes are present.
Furthermore, the transient region contains modes that cannot be characterized
as either, because the transition from non-tunneling to tunneling modes is
smooth. With a further analysis we document four intriguing observations: 1.
Considered as a function of coupling, the eigenstates go through avoided
crossings between tunneling and non-tunneling modes. 2. The dominance of
tunneling modes in high non-linearity region is compromised by an appearance of
new types of modes -- high order tunneling modes. These modes are similar to
the tunneling modes but have attributes of non-tunneling modes. ...

coupling), EXP008e3 (with exponential potential and exponential coupling) and
SUGRA003 (with supergravity potential and negative constant coupling) as well
as for a standard LCDM cosmology (with the WMAP7 parameters). Measuring the
cosines of the angles between the spin axes in isolated pairs of galactic halos
for each model and determining its probability density distribution, we show
that for the SUGRA003 model with bouncing cDE the null hypothesis of no spin
alignment in pairs of galactic halos is rejected at 99.999% confidence level.
In contrast, the LCDM cosmology yields no significant signal of spin alignment
and the other four cDE models also exhibit only weak signals of
spin-alignments. The strength of the spin alignment signal is found to be
almost independent of the total halo mass and separation distance in galaxy
pairs. Showing also that no signal is detected from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey DR 7, we conclude that the spin alignments in galaxy pairs is in
principle a unique test of bouncing cDE models.

investigated dynamical heterogeneity in a supercooled liquid under a steady
shear flow. Dynamical heterogeneity can be characterized by three quantities:
the correlation length $\xi_4(t)$, the intensity $\chi_4(t)$, and the lifetime
$\tau_\text{hetero}(t)$. We quantified all three quantities by means of the
correlation functions of the particle dynamics, i.e., the four-point
correlation functions, which are extended to the sheared condition. Here, to
define the local dynamics, we used two time intervals $t=\tau_\alpha$ and
$\tau_{\text{ngp}}$; $\tau_\alpha$ is the $\alpha$-relaxation time, and
$\tau_{\text{ngp}}$ is the time at which the non-Gaussian parameter of the Van
Hove self-correlation function is maximized. We discovered that all three
quantities ($\xi_4(t)$, $\chi_4(t)$, and $\tau_\text{hetero}(t)$) decrease as
the shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$ of the steady shear flow increases. For the time
interval $t=\tau_\alpha$, the scalings $\xi_4(\tau_\alpha) \sim
\dot{\gamma}^{-0.08}$, $\chi_4(\tau_\alpha) \sim \dot{\gamma}^{-0.26}$, and
$\tau_\text{hetero}(\tau_\alpha) \sim \dot{\gamma}^{-0.88}$ were obtained. The
steady shear flow suppresses the heterogeneous structure as well as the
lifetime of the dynamical heterogeneity. In addition, our results demonstrated
that the $\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ dependences of three quantities
coincide with those at equilibrium. This means that all three quantities of the
dynamical heterogeneity can be mapped onto those in the equilibrium state
through $\tau_\alpha$.

associated X-ray line emission assuming that it represents atomic transitions
in thermally excited hot gas. X-ray line emission, however, can also arise from
the charge exchange between highly ionised ions and neutral species. The
K\alpha\ triplet of He-like ions can be used as a powerful diagnostic, because
the charge exchange X-ray emission (CXE) favours the inter-combination and
forbidden lines, while the thermal emission favours the resonance line. We
analyse the OVII triplet of a sample of nine nearby star-forming galaxies
observed by the XMM-Newton reflection grating spectrometers. For most galaxies,
the forbidden lines are comparable to or stronger than the resonance lines,
which is in contrast to the thermal prediction. For NGC 253, M51, M83, M61, NGC
4631, and the Antennae galaxy, the observed line ratios are consistent with the
ratio of the CXE; for M94 and NGC 2903, the observed ratios indicate multiple
origins; for M82, different regions show different line ratios, also indicating
multiple origins. We discuss other possible mechanisms that can produce a
relatively strong forbidden line, such as a collisional
non-equilibrium-ionization recombining/ionizing plasma, which are not favoured.
These results suggest that the CXE may be a common process and contribute a
significant fraction of the soft X-ray line emission for galaxies with massive
star formation.

spectroscopically resolve the resonant splitting between the modes (strong

exploit intersubband polarons both for applied optoelectronic research, where a
precise control of the phonon resonances is needed, and also to observe
fundamental quantum vacuum physics, typical of the ultrastrong coupling regime.

solar nebula, out of which our solar system formed. They are a mixture of
silicate and oxide objects (chondrules and refractory inclusions) that
experienced extremely high temperatures, set in a matrix that remained
relatively cold. The prevalence of chondrites suggests that they formed through
a very general process, closely related to stellar and planet formation,
however the nature and properties of the responsible mechanism have remained
unclear for many decades. The evidence for a hot solar nebula provided by
chondrules and refractory inclusions is, however, seemingly at odds with
astrophysical observations of forming stars. These strongly indicate that
protostellar disks - the inspiralling disks of gas and dust out of which stars
and planets form - are relatively cool, and exhibit typical temperatures that
are insufficient to melt and vapourise silicate minerals at the radial
distances sampled by chondrule-bearing meteorites in the main asteroid belt.
Here we present calculations of the dynamical and thermal structure of
protostellar disks that accelerate a wind from the disk surfaces. These winds
are commonly associated with young stellar objects and are the analogues of the
early solar system. We also present models of the processing of dust particles
in such winds, showing that these outflows are suitable sites for chondrule
formation.

properties. Next, generalization to finite-temperatures in the form of well
established finite-temperature Lanczos method is described. The latter allows
for the evaluation of temperatures T>0 static and dynamic quantities within
various correlated models. Several extensions and modification of the latter
method introduced more recently are analysed. In particular, the
low-temperature Lanczos method and the microcanonical Lanczos method,
especially applicable within the high-T regime. In order to overcome the
problems of exponentially growing Hilbert spaces that prevent ED calculations
on larger lattices, different approaches based on Lanczos diagonalization
within the reduced basis have been developed. In this context, recently
developed method based on ED within a limited functional space is reviewed.
Finally, we briefly discuss the real-time evolution of correlated systems far
from equilibrium, which can be simulated using the ED and Lanczos-based
methods, as well as approaches based on the diagonalization in a reduced basis.

consider the computation of the Lyapunov exponent using the polynomial density

changes in the mean value or in the variance. The first case is when the time
data is modeled as a sequence of independent and normal distributed random
variables with unknown, possibly changing, mean value but fixed variance. The
main assumption is that the mean value is piecewise constant in time, and the
task is to estimate the change times and the mean values within the segments.
The second case is when the mean value is constant, but the variance can
change. The assumption is that the variance is piecewise constant in time, and
we want to estimate change times and the variance values within the segments.
To find solutions to these problems, we will study an l_1 regularized maximum
likelihood method, related to the fused lasso method and l_1 trend filtering,
where the parameters to be estimated are free to vary at each sample. To
penalize variations in the estimated parameters, the l_1-norm of the time
difference of the parameters is used as a regularization term. This idea is
closely related to total variation denoising. The main contribution is that a
convex formulation of this variance estimation problem, where the
parametrization is based on the inverse of the variance, can be formulated as a
certain l_1 mean estimation problem. This implies that results and methods for
mean estimation can be applied to the challenging problem of variance
segmentation/estimation.

transformations (NLT) of random variables, in order to establish useful tools
for estimation and information theory. Specifically, the paper focuses on
linear regression analysis of the NLT output and derives sufficient general
conditions to establish when the input-output regression coefficient is equal
to the \emph{partial} regression coefficient of the output with respect to a
(additive) part of the input. A special case is represented by zero-mean
Gaussian inputs, obtained as the sum of other zero-mean Gaussian random
variables. The paper shows how this property can be generalized to the
regression coefficient of non-linear transformations of Gaussian-mixtures. Due
to its generality, and the wide use of Gaussians and Gaussian-mixtures to
statistically model several phenomena, this theoretical framework can find
applications in multiple disciplines, such as communication, estimation, and
information theory, when part of the nonlinear transformation input is the
quantity of interest and the other part is the noise. In particular, the paper
shows how the said properties can be exploited to simplify closed-form
computation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the estimation mean-squared
error (MSE), and bounds on the mutual information in additive non-Gaussian
(possibly non-linear) channels, also establishing relationships among them.

impose a simple shear flow and study the athermal motion of jammed assemblies
of soft particles, both for purely repulsive interactions and in the presence
of an additional short-range attraction of varying strength. In steady state,
pronounced flow inhomogeneities emerge for all systems when the shear rate
becomes small. Deviations from linear flow are stronger in magnitude and become
very long-lived when the strength of the attraction increases, but differ from
permanent shear-bands. Flow inhomogeneities occur in a stress window bounded by
the dynamic and static yield stress values. Attractive forces enhance the flow
heterogeneities because they accelerate stress relaxation, thus effectively
moving the system closer to the yield stress regime where inhomogeneities are
most pronounced. The present scenario for understanding the effect of particle
adhesion on shear localization, which is based on detailed molecular dynamics
simulations with realistic particle interactions, differs qualitatively from
previous qualitative explanations and ad-hoc theoretical modelling.

arise in Hamiltonian lattice mechanics as models for fe?rromagnetism and as
discretization of elliptic PDEs. Mathematically, they are a multidimensional
counterpart of monotone twist maps. They often admit a variational structure,
so that the solutions are the stationary points of a formal action function.
Classical Aubry-Mather theory establishes the existence of a large collection
of solutions of any rotation vector. For irrational rotation vectors this is
the well-known Aubry-Mather set. It consists of global minimizers and it may
have gaps.
  In this paper, we study the gradient flow of the formal action function and
we prove that every Aubry-Mather set can be interpolated by a continuous
gradient-flow invariant family, the so-called ""ghost circle"". The existence of
ghost circles is first proved for rational rotation vectors and Morse action
functions. The main technical result is a compactness theorem for ghost
circles, based on a parabolic Harnack inequality for the gradient flow, which
implies the existence of ghost circles of arbitrary rotation vectors and for
arbitrary actions. As a consequence, we can give a simple proof of the fact
that when an Aubry-Mather set has a gap, then this gap must be parametrized by
minimizers, or contain a non-minimizing solution.

number is irrational, the Aubry-Mather set is either connected or a Cantor set.
A connected Aubry-Mather set is called a minimal foliation. In the case of

generally mix valleys, we show that metallic armchair nanoribbons possess a

semiconducting armchair nanoribbons inevitably mix valleys and restore TRS. As
a result, in strong disorder metallic armchair ribbons exhibit a perfectly

also provide measures of partition uncertainty. When applied to case--control

associations created merely by LD with disease loci within the same blocks.
Simulation study showed that this approach is more powerful in detecting
multi-locus associations than other methods we tested, including one of ours.

dwarf donor and a neutron star or black hole accretor. The evolution of UCXBs
and very low mass ratio binaries in general is poorly understood. Aims. We
investigate the evolution of UCXBs in order to learn for which mass ratios and
accretor types these systems can exist, and if they do, what are their orbital
and neutron star spin periods, mass transfer rates and evolutionary timescales.
Methods. For different assumptions concerning accretion disk behavior we
calculate for which system parameters dynamical instability, thermal-viscous
disk instability or the propeller effect emerge. Results. At the onset of mass
transfer, the survival of the UCXB is determined by how efficiently the
accretor can eject matter in the case of a super-Eddington mass transfer rate.
At later times, the evolution of systems strongly depends on the binary's
capacity to return angular momentum from the disk to the orbit. We find that
this feedback mechanism most likely remains effective. In the case of steady
mass transfer, the propeller effect can stop accretion onto recycled neutron
stars completely at a sufficiently low mass transfer rate, based on energy
considerations. However, mass transfer will likely be non-steady because disk
instability allows for accretion of some of the transferred matter. Together,
the propeller effect and disk instability cause the low mass ratio UCXBs to be
visible a small fraction of the time at most, thereby explaining the lack of
observations of such systems. Conclusions. Most likely UCXBs avoid late-time
dynamically unstable mass transfer and continue to evolve as the age of the
Universe allows. This implies the existence of a large population of low mass
ratio binaries with orbital periods ~ 70 - 80 min, unless some other mechanism
has destroyed these binaries.

higher in the hard than in the soft band for f_x < 10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and
lower above this flux limit. We confirm that the clustering strength theta_0
grows with the flux limit of the sample, a trend which is also present in the
amplitude of the spatial correlation function, but only for the soft band. In
the hard band, it remains almost constant with r_0 = 10h^-1$ Mpc, irrespective
of the flux limit. Our analysis of AGN subsamples with different hardness
ratios shows that the sources with a hard-spectrum are more clustered than
soft-spectrum ones. This result may be a hint that the two main types of AGN
populate different environments. Finally, we find that our clustering results

theory description of photon propagation in the quantum vacuum. It accounts for
the vacuum fluctuations of the underlying theory, and in the presence of
external electromagnetic fields, gives rise to such striking phenomena as
vacuum birefringence and dichroism. Standard approximations of the polarization
tensor are often restricted to on-the-light-cone dynamics in homogeneous
electromagnetic fields, and are limited to certain momentum regimes only. We
devise two different strategies to go beyond these limitations: First, we aim

Large-scale simulation models are used to predict epidemic dynamics and

survey data. These assumptions are also used for estimating transmission
measures such as the basic reproductive number and secondary attack rates.
Development of methodology to infer contact networks from survey data could
improve these models and estimation methods. We contribute to this area by
developing a model of within-household social contacts and using it to analyze
the Belgian POLYMOD data set, which contains detailed diaries of social
contacts in a 24-hour period. We model dependency in contact behavior through a
latent variable indicating which household members are at home. We estimate
age-specific probabilities of being at home and age-specific probabilities of
contact conditional on two members being at home. Our results differ from the
standard random mixing assumption. In addition, we find that the probability
that all members contact each other on a given day is fairly low: 0.49 for
households with two 0--5 year olds and two 19--35 year olds, and 0.36 for
households with two 12--18 year olds and two 36+ year olds. We find higher
contact rates in households with 2--3 members, helping explain the higher
influenza secondary attack rates found in households of this size.

it will be possible to distinguish the light higgsino model from generic SUSY

play a crucial role for model discrimination.

from investigation of asymptotics of potentials and concerning statistics of

performed with the HIFI instrument towards two bright shock spots (R4 and B2)
along the outflow driven by the L1448 low-mass proto-stellar system, located in
the Perseus cloud. These data are used to identify the physical conditions
giving rise to the H2O emission and infer any dependence with velocity. These
observations provide evidence that the observed water lines probe a warm
(T_kin~400-600 K) and very dense (n 10^6 - 10^7 cm^-3) gas, not traced by other
molecules, such as low-J CO and SiO, but rather traced by mid-IR H2 emission.
In particular, H2O shows strong differences with SiO in the excitation
conditions and in the line profiles in the two observed shocked positions,
pointing to chemical variations across the various velocity regimes and
chemical evolution in the different shock spots. Physical and kinematical
differences can be seen at the two shocked positions. At the R4 position, two
velocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with the
component at higher velocity (R4-HV) being less extended and less dense than
the low velocity component (R4-LV). H2O column densities of about 2 10^13 and 4
10^14 cm^-2 have been derived for the R4-LV and the R4-HV components,
respectively. The conditions inferred for the B2 position are similar to those
of the R4-HV component, with H2O column density in the range 10^14 - 5 10^14
cm^-2, corresponding to H2O/H2 abundances in the range 0.5 - 1 10^-5. The
observed line ratios and the derived physical conditions seem to be more
consistent with excitation in a low velocity J-type shock with large
compression rather than in a stationary C-shock, although none of these
stationary models seems able to reproduce all the characteristics of the
observed emission.

Beta Decay (0$\nu$DBD) and Dark Matter experiments, bolometers are very
promising because of their favorable properties (excellent energy resolution,
high detector efficiency, a wide choice of different materials used as
absorber, ...). However, up to now, the actual interesting possibility to
identify the interacting particle, and thus to greatly reduce the background,
can be fulfilled only with a double read-out (i.e. the simultaneous and
independent read out of heat and scintillation light or heat and ionization).
This double read-out could greatly complicate the assembly of a huge,
multi-detector array, such as CUORE and EURECA. The possibility to recognize
the interacting particle through the shape of the thermal pulse is then clearly
a very interesting opportunity.
  While detailed analyses of the signal time development in purely thermal
detectors have not produced so far interesting results, similar analyses on
macro-bolometers ($\sim$10-500 g) built with scintillating crystals showed that
it is possible to distinguish between an electron or $\gamma$-ray and an
$\alpha$ particle interaction (i.e. the main source of background for 0$\nu$DBD
experiments based on the bolometric technique). Results on pulse shape analysis
of a CaMoO$_4$ crystal operated as bolometer is reported as an example. An
explanation of this behavior, based on the energy partition in the heat and
scintillation channels, is also presented.

coordinates aligned with outgoing null cones. While these coordinates were
designed for studying gravitational waves, they can also be easily adapted to
model cosmological past null cones (PNCs). Similar to observational coordinates
in the observational approach to cosmology, this then provides a model that
only makes use of information causally connected to an observer. However, the
diameter distance, which is used as a radial coordinate, limits the model's
cosmological application to the region prior to the PNC refocussing. This is
because after refocussing, the diameter distance ceases to be a unique measure
of distance. This paper addresses the problem by introducing a metric based on
the Bondi-Sachs metric where the radial coordinate is replaced by an affine
parameter. A model is derived from this metric and it is then shown how an
existing numerical scheme can be adapted for simulation of cosmological PNC
behaviour. Numerical calculations on this model are found to have the same
stability and convergence properties as the standard characteristic formalism.

square grid, naturally refined according to certain link patterns. If $A_X$ is
the number of FPLs with link pattern $X$, the Razumov--Stroganov correspondence
provides relations between numbers $A_X$ relative to a given grid size. In
another line of research, if $X\cup p$ denotes $X$ with $p$ additional nested
arches, then $A_{X\cup p}$ was shown to be polynomial in $p$: the proof gives
rise to certain configurations of FPLs in a triangle (TFPLs). In this work we
investigate these TFPL configurations and their relation to FPLs. We prove
certain properties of TFPLs, and enumerate them under special boundary
conditions. From this study we deduce a class of linear relations, conjectured
by Thapper, between quantities $A_X$ relative to different grid sizes,
relations which thus differ from the Razumov--Stroganov ones.

between a molecular junction and the metallic leads in time-dependent quantum
transport. We employ the recently developed embedded Kadanoff-Baym method
[Phys. Rev. B 80, 115107 (2009)] and show that the molecule-lead interaction
changes substantially the transient and steady-state transport properties. We
first show that the mean-field Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation does not capture
the polarization effects responsible for the renormalization of the molecular
levels neither in nor out of equilibrium. Furthermore, due to the time-local
nature of the HF self-energy there exists a region in parameter space for which
the system does not relax after the switch-on of a bias voltage. These and
other artifacts of the HF approximation disappear when including correlations
at the second-Born or GW levels. Both these approximations contain polarization
diagrams which correctly account for the screening of the charged molecule. We
find that by changing the molecule-lead interaction the ratio between the
screening and relaxation time changes, an effect which must be properly taken
into account in any realistic time-dependent simulation. Another important
finding is that while in equilibrium the molecule-lead interaction is
responsible for a reduction of the HOMO-LUMO gap and for a substantial
redistribution of the spectral weight between the main spectral peaks and the
induced satellite spectrum, in the biased system it can have the opposite
effect, i.e., it sharpens the spectral peaks and opens the HOMO-LUMO gap.

jumps in the low temperature region, and a second peak-effect in the
intermediate temperature region, especially when the field sweeping rate is
low. Interestingly a third magnetization peak can be easily observed on the
MHLs in the high temperature region. Further analysis find that the first
magnetization peak is very sharp, which is associated with the strong vortex
pinning. However the first dip of the MHL corresponds to a moderate relaxation
rate, then a second peak appears accompanied by a vanishing vortex motion.
Finally a third magnetization peak emerges and the vortex motion becomes
drastic beyond this threshold. The novel features accompanying the second
magnetization peak suggest a new type of vortex phase transition.

The transformation method, which is originally used to control physical field

dynamic parameters when the global statuses of a network system are prescribed
in a space. The feasibility of this transformation method is demonstrated and
verified by two examples (a communication field cloak and a communication field
bender) in the network system. It is shown that the global system state can be
controlled by adjusting the local nodes dynamics with the transformation

applications, which enables them to adapt and perform tasks based on context.
One of the adaptive features of context-awareness is contextual
reconfiguration. Contextual reconfiguration involves discovering remote
service(s) based on context and binding them to the application components to
realize new behaviors, which may be needed to satisfy user needs or to enrich
user experience. One of the steps in the reconfiguration process involves a
remote lookup to discover the service(s) based on context. This remote lookup
process provides the largest contribution to reconfiguration time and this is
due to fact that the remote calls are much slower than local calls.
Consequently, it affects system performance. In pervasive computing
applications, this may turn out to be undesirable in terms of user experience.
Moreover, other distributed applications using the network may be affected as
every remote method call decreases the amount of bandwidth available on the
network. Various systems provide reconfiguration support and offer high-level
reconfiguration directives to develop adaptive context-aware applications, but
do not address this performance bottleneck. We address this issue and implement
seamless caching of virtual stubs within our PCRA1 for improved performance. In
this paper we present and describe our transparent caching support and also
provide its performance evaluation.
