off-center helium core flash in their 0.48 solar mass He core as they ascend
the red giant branch (RGB). This off-center flash is the first of a few
successive helium shell subflashes that remove the core electron degeneracy
over 2 Myrs, converting the object into a He burning star. Though characterized
by Thomas over 40 years ago, this core flash phase has yet to be
observationally probed. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics (MESA) code, we show that red giant asteroseismology enabled by
space-based photometry (i.e. Kepler and CoRoT) can probe these stars during the
flash. The rapid (< 100,000 years) contraction of the red giant envelope after
the initiating flash dramatically improves the coupling of the p-modes to the
core g-modes, making the detection of l=1 mixed modes possible for these 2
Myrs. This duration implies that 1 in 35 stars near the red clump in the HR
diagram will be in their core flash phase. During this time, the star has a
g-mode period spacing of Delta P_g = 70-100 seconds, lower than the Delta
P_g=250 seconds of He burning stars in the red clump, but higher than the RGB
stars at the same luminosity. This places them in an underpopulated part of the
large frequency spacing (Delta nu) vs. Delta P_g diagram that should ease their
identification amongst the thousands of observed red giants.

the hypermagnetic field value changes due to alpha^2-dynamo and the lepton
asymmetry rises due to the Abelian anomaly. We solve the corresponding
integro-differential equations for the lepton asymmetries describing such
self-consistent dynamics for lepto- and baryogenesis in the two scenarios : (i)
when a primordial lepton asymmetry sits in right electrons e_R; and (ii) when,
in addition to e_R, a left lepton asymmetry for e_L and nu_eL arises due to
chirality flip reactions provided by inverse Higgs decays at the temperatures,
T<T_RL ~ 10 TeV. We find that the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) rises
very fast through such leptogenesis, especially, in strong hypermagnetic
fields. Varying (decreasing) the CS wave number parameter k_0 < 10^-7 T_EW one
can recover the observable value of BAU, eta_B ~ 10^-9, where k_0 = 10^-7 T_EW
corresponds to the maximum value for CS wave number surviving ohmic dissipation
of hypermagnetic field. In the scenario (ii) one predicts the essential
difference of the lepton numbers of right - and left electrons at EWPT time,
L_eR - L_eL ~ (mu_eR - mu_eL) / T_EW = Delta mu / T_EW ~ 10^-5 that can be used

ultraviolet to the near infrared with X-Shooter for one of the nearest M9

activity parameters for ultracool dwarfs from the literature with the aim to
advance our understanding of these objects by comparing them to early-M type
dwarf stars and the Sun.
  Our deep XMM-Newton observation has led to the first X-ray detection of
DENIS-P J1048-3956 (log Lx = 25.1) as well as the first measurement of its V
band brightness (V = 17.35mag). Flux-flux relations between X-ray and
chromospheric activity indicators are here for the first time extended into the
regime of the ultracool dwarfs. The approximate agreement of DENIS-P J1048-3956
and other ultracool dwarfs with flux-flux relations for early-M dwarfs suggests
that the same heating mechanisms work in the atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs,
albeit weaker as judged from their lower fluxes. The observed Balmer decrements
of DENIS-P J1048-3956 are compatible with optically thick plasma in LTE at low,
nearly photospheric temperature or optically thin LTE plasma at 20000K.
Describing the decrements with CaseB recombination requires different emitting
regions for Halpha and the higher Balmer lines. The high observed Halpha/Hbeta
flux ratio is also poorly fitted by the optically thin models. We derive a
similarly high value for the Halpha/Hbeta ratio of vB10 and LHS2065 and
conclude that this may be a characteristic of ultracool dwarfs. We add DENIS-P
J1048-3956 to the list of ultracool dwarfs detected in both the radio and the
X-ray band. The Benz-Guedel relation between radio and X-ray luminosity of
late-type stars is well-known to be violated by ultracool dwarfs. We speculate
on the presence of two types of ultracool dwarfs with distinct radio and X-ray
behavior.

special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) code, developed with the aim of
studying the highly relativistic flows in Gamma-Ray Burst sources. The SRHD
equations are solved using finite volume conservative solvers. The correct
implementation of the algorithms is verified by one-dimensional (1D) shock tube
and multidimensional tests. The code is then applied to study the propagation
of 1D spherical impulsive blast waves expanding in a stratified medium with
$\rho \propto r^{-k}$, bridging between the relativistic and Newtonian phases,
as well as to a two-dimensional (2D) cylindrically symmetric impulsive jet
propagating in a constant density medium. It is shown that the deceleration to
non-relativistic speeds in one-dimension occurs on scales significantly larger
than the Sedov length. This transition is further delayed with respect to the
Sedov length as the degree of stratification of the ambient medium is
increased. This result, together with the scaling of position, Lorentz factor
and the shock velocity as a function of time and shock radius, is explained
here using a simple analytical model based on energy conservation. The method
used for calculating the afterglow radiation by post-processing the results of
the simulations is described in detail. The light curves computed using the
results of 1D numerical simulations during the relativistic stage correctly
reproduce those calculated assuming the self-similar Blandford-McKee solution
for the evolution of the flow. The jet dynamics from our 2D simulations and the
resulting afterglow lightcurves, including the jet break, are in good agreement
with those presented in previous works. Finally, we show how the details of the
dynamics critically depend on properly resolving the structure of the
relativistic flow.

We perform a parameter study where the shear flow and the rotational influence
are varied to probe the relative importance of both types of dynamos.
Oscillatory solutions are preferred both in the kinematic and saturated regimes
when the negative ratio of shear to rotation rates, $q\equiv -S/\varOmega$, is
between 1.5 and 2, i.e., when shear and rotation are of comparable strengths.
Other regions of oscillatory solutions are found with small values of $q$,
i.e., when shear is weak in comparison to rotation, and in the regime of large
negative $q$s, when shear is very strong in comparison to rotation. However,
exceptions to these rules also appear so that for a given ratio of shear to
rotation, solutions are non-oscillatory for small and large shear, but
oscillatory in the intermediate range. Changing the boundary conditions from
vertical field to perfect conductor ones changes the dynamo mode from
oscillatory to quasi-steady. Furthermore, in many cases an oscillatory solution
exists only in the kinematic regime whereas in the nonlinear stage the mean
fields are stationary. However, the cases with rotation and no shear are always
oscillatory in the parameter range studied here and the dynamo mode does not
depend on the magnetic boundary conditions. The strengths of total and
large-scale components of the magnetic field in the saturated state, however,
are sensitive to the chosen boundary conditions.

ratio using two phase numerical sim- ulations based on a discrete element
method (DEM) for particles coupled to a continuum Reynolds averaged description
of hydrodynamics. At a density ratio close to unity (typically under water),
vertical velocities are so small that sediment transport occurs in a thin layer
at the surface of the static bed, and is called bed load. Steady, or
'saturated' transport is reached when the fluid borne shear stress at the
interface between the mobile grains and the static grains is reduced to its
threshold value. The number of grains transported per unit surface is therefore
limited by the flux of horizontal momentum towards the surface. However, the
fluid velocity in the transport layer remains almost undisturbed so that the
mean grain velocity scales with the shear velocity u\ast. At large density
ratio (typically in air), the vertical velocities are large enough to make the
transport layer wide and dilute. Sediment transport is then called saltation.
In this case, particles are able to eject others when they collide with the
granular bed, a process called splash. The number of grains transported per
unit surface is selected by the balance between erosion and deposition and
saturation is reached when one grain is statistically replaced by exactly one
grain after a collision, which has the consequence that the mean grain velocity
remains independent of u\ast. The influence of the density ratio is
systematically studied to reveal the transition between these two transport
regimes. Based on the mechanisms identified in the steady case, we discuss the
transient of saturation of sediment transport and in particular the saturation
time and length. Finally, we investigate the exchange of particles between the
mobile and static phases and we determine the exchange time of particles.

unaffected. The inclusion of this parameter offers additional structure for the
main body of the distribution, improves the stability of the modified scale,
tail index and return level estimates to threshold choice and allows a lower

said to be umbilical along a direction N normal to S if the second fundamental
form along N is proportional to the first fundamental form of S. In particular,
S is pseudo-umbilical if it is umbilical along the mean curvature vector field
H, and (totally) umbilical if it is umbilical along all possible normal
directions. The possibility that the surface be umbilical along the unique
normal direction orthogonal to H --- ""ortho-umbilical"" surface--- is also
considered.
  I prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for S to be umbilical
along a normal direction is that two independent Weingarten operators (and, a
fortiori, all of them) commute, or equivalently that the shape tensor be
diagonalizable on S. The umbilical direction is then uniquely determined. This
can be seen to be equivalent to a condition relating the normal curvature and
the appropriate part of the Riemann tensor of the spacetime. In particular, for
conformally flat spacetimes (including Lorentz space forms) the necessary and
sufficient condition is that the normal curvature vanishes. Some further
consequences are analyzed, and the extension of the main results to arbitrary

We develop a method for calculating and correcting for the halo contamination

representing disk and halo populations are used to fit the radial and vertical
velocity distributions via maximum likelihood methods. For the azimuthal
velocities the same technique is used, except that a skewed non-Gaussian

to compute the dispersions and cross-terms (the tilt and the vertex deviation)

investigate the rotation lag of the disk, finding that the more metal-poor
stars rotate significantly slower than the metal-rich stars. These samples
provide important constraints on heating mechanisms in the Galactic disk and
can be used for a variety of applications. We present one such application,
employing the Jeans equations to provide a simple model of the potential close

chooses a secret pattern of colored pegs, and a codebreaker has to guess it in
several trials. After each attempt, the codebreaker gets a response from the
codemaker containing some information on the number of correctly guessed pegs.
The search space is thus reduced at each turn, and the game continues until the
codebreaker is able to find the correct code, or runs out of trials.
  In this paper we study several variations of #MSP, the problem of computing
the size of the search space resulting from a given (possibly fictitious)
sequence of guesses and responses. Our main contribution is a proof of the
#P-completeness of #MSP under parsimonious reductions, which settles an open
problem posed by Stuckman and Zhang in 2005, concerning the complexity of
deciding if the secret code is uniquely determined by the previous guesses and
responses. Similarly, #MSP stays #P-complete under Turing reductions even with
the promise that the search space has at least k elements, for any constant k.
(In a regular game of Mastermind, k=1.)

Taub-NUT-AdS metric with a non-trivial instanton for the graviphoton field. The
holographic free energy of this solution agrees precisely with the large N
limit of the free energy obtained from the localized partition function of a
class of Chern-Simons quiver gauge theories. We also discuss a different
supersymmetric solution, whose boundary is a biaxially squashed Lens space
S^3/Z_2 with a topologically non-trivial background gauge field. This metric is
of Eguchi-Hanson-AdS type, although it is not Einstein, and has a single unit
of gauge field flux through the S^2 cycle.

electromagnetic field and accompanying mode indices is essential for the proper
quantification of all light-matter interactions. In particular light fields
with cylindrical symmetry such as Laguerre-Gaussian beams can possess orbital
angular momentum, central to a wide range of emergent applications in quantum
cryptography, manipulation, astrophysics and microscopy. A wide array of
diffractive structures such as arrays of pinholes, triangular apertures, slits,
and holograms have all recently been used to measure the azimuthal index L of
individual LG beams. However, all these approaches measure only one single
degree of freedom of LG beams, neglecting the radial component or P index and
are thus not applicable for a priori unknown beams. Furthermore, it is unclear
which is the optimal aperture and scheme needed to determine simultaneously the
azimuthal and radial indices nor the extent with which such an aperture can
tolerate deviations in beam parameters. Here, we demonstrate a powerful
approach to simultaneously measure the radial and azimuthal indices of both
pure and mixed LG light fields. We show that the shape of the diffracting
element used to measure the mode indices is in fact of little importance and
the crucial step is training any diffracting optical system and transforming
the observed pattern into uncorrelated variables. Modest fluctuations in beam
parameters such as waist size and alignment variations can be tolerated in our
scheme. Importantly, beam superpositions can be experimentally decomposed
delivering the intensity of each mode and their relative phases. Our results
demonstrate the complete characterisation of LG beams. The approach can be
expanded to other families of beams and represents a powerful method for
characterising the optical multi-dimensional Hilbert space.

led to various surprising results, including the conclusion that the cosmic-ray
ionization rate (zeta_2) is about 1 order of magnitude larger than previously
thought. The present survey expands the sample of diffuse cloud sight lines
with H3+ observations to 50, with detections in 21 of those. Ionization rates
inferred from these observations are in the range (1.7+-1.3)x10^-16
s^-1<zeta_2<(10.6+-8.2)x10^-16 s^-1 with a mean value of
zeta_2=(3.5^+5.3_-3.0)x10^-16 s^-1. Upper limits (3 sigma) derived from
non-detections of H3+ are as low as zeta_2<0.4x10^-16 s^-1. These low
upper-limits, in combination with the wide range of inferred cosmic-ray
ionization rates, indicate variations in zeta_2 between different diffuse cloud
sight lines. A study of zeta_2 versus N_H (total hydrogen column density) shows
that the two parameters are not correlated for diffuse molecular cloud sight
lines, but that the ionization rate decreases when N_H increases to values
typical of dense molecular clouds. Both the difference in ionization rates
between diffuse and dense clouds and the variation of zeta_2 among diffuse
cloud sight lines are likely the result of particle propagation effects. The
lower ionization rate in dense clouds is due to the inability of low-energy
(few MeV) protons to penetrate such regions, while the ionization rate in
diffuse clouds is controlled by the proximity of the observed cloud to a site
of particle acceleration.

Rules (AR's) are fundamental primitives in data mining and database
applications. Exact algorithms for these problems exist and are widely used,
but their running time is hindered by the need of scanning the entire dataset,
possibly multiple times. High quality approximations of FI's and AR's are
sufficient for most practical uses, and a number of recent works explored the
application of sampling for fast discovery of approximate solutions to the
problems. However, these works do not provide satisfactory performance
guarantees on the quality of the approximation, due to the difficulty of
bounding the probability of under- or over-sampling any one of an unknown
number of frequent itemsets. In this work we circumvent this issue by applying
the statistical concept of \emph{Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension} to develop
a novel technique for providing tight bounds on the sample size that guarantees
approximation within user-specified parameters. Our technique applies both to
absolute and to relative approximations of (top-$K$) FI's and AR's. The
resulting sample size is linearly dependent on the VC-dimension of a range
space associated with the dataset to be mined. The main theoretical
contribution of this work is a proof that the VC-dimension of this range space
is upper bounded by an easy-to-compute characteristic quantity of the dataset
which we call \emph{d-index}, and is the maximum integer $d$ such that the
dataset contains at least $d$ transactions of length at least $d$ such that no
one of them is a superset of or equal to another. We show that this bound is
strict for a large class of datasets.

infall at high rates at radii beyond ~50 AU leads to disk fragmentation. At
lower infall rates <1e-5 Msun/yr, however, irradiation suppresses
fragmentation. We find that, once formed, the fragments or clumps migrate
inward on typical type-I time scales of ~2e3 yr initially, but later migration
deviates from the type-I time scale when the clump becomes more massive than
the local disk mass, and/or when they starts to open gaps. As they migrate, the
clumps accrete from the disk at a rate 1e-3 to 1e-1 MJupiter/yr, consistent
with analytic estimates that assume a 1-2 Hill radii cross section. Most clumps
can grow to their isolation masses >0.1 Msun quickly. The eventual fates of
these clumps, however, diverges depending on the migration speed: 3 out of 13
clumps become massive enough (brown dwarf mass) to open gaps in the disk and
essentially stop migrating; 4 are tidally destroyed during inward migration; 6
migrate across the inner simulated disk boundary. A simple analytic model for
clump evolution is derived to explain these different fates. Overall, our
results indicate that fast migration, accretion, and tidal destruction of the

the wavelength region up to 1100 nm we investigate the performance of 2x2 mm^2
avalanche photo diodes (APDs) of type S0223 manufactured by Radiation
Monitoring Devices. To minimize thermal noise, the APDs are cooled to
approximately -170 deg. C using liquid nitrogen. By operating the diodes close
to the breakdown voltage it is possible to achieve relative gains in excess of
2x10^4. Custom-made low noise preamplifiers are used to read out the devices.
The measurements presented in this paper have been obtained at a relative gain
of 2.2x10^4. At a discriminator threshold of 6 mV the resulting dark count rate
is in the region of 230/s. With these settings the studied APDs are able to
detect single photons at 628 nm wavelength with a photo detection efficiency of
(67+-7)%. Measurements at 1020 nm wavelength have been performed using the
attenuated output of a grating spectrograph with a light bulb as photon source.
With this setup the photo detection efficiency at 1020 nm has been determined
to be (13+-3)%, again at a threshold of 6 mV.

that point-spread function (PSF) effects on measured galaxy shapes in current

this work, we co-add existing Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging on the
equatorial stripe in order to build a data set with the statistical power to
measure cosmic shear, while using a rounding kernel method to null out the
effects of the anisotropic PSF. We build a galaxy catalogue from the combined
imaging, characterise its photometric properties, and show that the spurious
shear remaining in this catalogue after the PSF correction is negligible
compared to the expected cosmic shear signal. We identify a new source of
systematic error in the shear-shear auto-correlations arising from selection
biases related to masking. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which this
method is expected to be useful for upcoming ground-based surveys that have
lensing as one of the science goals, and identify the systematic errors that
can reduce its efficacy.

the first place, that the overall effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the
halo bispectrum is larger than on the halo power spectrum when all measurable
configurations are taken into account. We then compare our measurements with a
tree-level perturbative prediction finding good agreement at large scale when
the constant Gaussian bias parameter, both linear and quadratic, and their
constant non-Gaussian corrections are fitted for. The best-fit values of the
Gaussian bias factors and their non-Gaussian, scale-independent corrections are
in qualitative agreement with the peak-background split expectations. In
particular, we show that the effect of non-Gaussian initial conditions on
squeezed configurations is fairly large (up to 30% for f_NL=100 at redshift
z=0.5) and results from contributions of similar amplitude induced by the
initial matter bispectrum, scale-dependent bias corrections as well as from
nonlinear matter bispectrum corrections. We show, in addition, that effects at
second order in f_NL are irrelevant for the range of values allowed by CMB and
galaxy power spectrum measurements, at least on the scales probed by our
simulations. Finally, we present a Fisher matrix analysis to assess the
possibility of constraining primordial non-Gaussianity with future measurements
of the galaxy bispectrum. We find that a survey with a volume of about 10 cubic
Gpc at mean redshift z ~ 1 could provide an error on f_NL of the order of a
few. This shows the relevance of a joint analysis of galaxy power spectrum and
bispectrum in future redshift surveys.

smaller than predicted by standard magnetic accretion torque theory, while the

thirteen years. We find that the expansion of the 2 hr orbit is accelerating at

quadrupole coupling due to variations in the oblateness of the companion can be
a viable mechanism for explaining the observations. No significant spin
frequency derivatives are detected during the 2011 outburst (<4E-13 Hz/s) and
the long term spin down remains stable over thirteen years with a rate of

evolution, a solar-type star is powered primarily by gravitational contraction
of its helium core, rather than by nuclear fusion. Because this energy is
released in the core rather than the envelope, the overall structure of the
star, and so its luminosity, is driven toward that of a red clump star from its
initial position at the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). This occurs on a
first (and well recognized) Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale t_{KH,1} ~ E_env/L_TRGB
~ 1e4 yrs., where E_env is the thermal energy stored in the envelope and L_TRGB
is the luminosity at the TRGB. However, once the star assumes the approximate
structure of a clump star, it remains powered primarily by contraction for a
{\it second} Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale t_{KH,2} ~ E_core/L_clump ~ 1e6 yrs,
where E_core is the thermal energy stored in the core and L_clump is the
luminosity of a clump star. It is this second Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale that
determines the overall pace of the moderately violent processes by which the
star returns to nuclear-power generation as a full-fledged clump star. The
reservoir of gravitational energy acts as ultimate regulator, providing
whatever supplemental energy is needed to power L_clump and occasionally
absorbing the large momentary excesses from helium mini-flashes. As this
reservoir is gradually exhausted, helium fusion approaches the level of
steady-state clump stars.

continued by the dSphs indicating a similar origin. The observed change in the
CMR slope may mark the point at which gas loss prevented significant metal
enrichment. The almost constant scatter around the CMR possibly indicates a
short formation period, resulting in similar stellar populations. The
luminosity function shows a Schechter function's faint end slope of
-1.50\pm0.17, implying a lack of galaxies related to the expected number of

describe algorithms to compute multiple types of non-trivial cycles in G, using
different techniques depending on whether or not G is an undirected graph. If G
is undirected, then we give an algorithm to compute a shortest non-separating
cycle in 2^O(g) n log log n time. Similar algorithms are given to compute a
shortest non-contractible or non-null-homologous cycle in 2^O(g+b) n log log n

techniques for efficiently enumerating homotopy classes of curves that may be
shortest non-trivial cycles.
  Our main technical contributions in this work arise from assuming G is a
directed graph with possibly asymmetric edge weights. For this case, we give an
algorithm to compute a shortest non-contractible cycle in G in O((g^3 + g b)n
log n) time. In order to achieve this time bound, we use a restriction of the
infinite cyclic cover that may be useful in other contexts. We also describe an
algorithm to compute a shortest non-null-homologous cycle in G in O((g^2 + g
b)n log n) time, extending a known algorithm of Erickson to compute a shortest
non-separating cycle. In both the undirected and directed cases, our algorithms
improve the best time bounds known for many values of g and b.

gzK filter set and find that the star forming BzK selection successfully
selects 76% of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 1.4<z<2.5 in our

evolving at z<1, but galaxies of higher mass reaching their present day numbers
by z~0.8-1. This is consistent with the present picture of downsizing in galaxy
evolution. We compare our results with the predictions of the GALFORM

relatively successful fit to the observed mass functions at intermediate masses

PZ Tel. PZ Tel was recently found to host a young and low-mass companion. Using
FEROS spectra we have measured atomic abundances (e.g. Fe and Li) and
chromospheric activity for PZ Tel and used these to obtain metallicity and age
estimates for the companion. We find PZ Tel to be a rapidly rotating
(vsini=73\pm5km/s), ~solar metallicity star (logN(Fe)=-4.37 dex or [Fe/H]=0.05
dex) with a measured mean logR'HK of -4.12. We measure a NLTE lithium abundance
of logN(Li)=3.1\pm0.1dex, which from depletion models gives rise to an age of
7+4-2 Myrs for the system. The measured chromospheric activity returns an age
of 26\pm2Myrs, as does fitting pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks
(Tau_evol=22\pm3Myrs), both of which are in disagreement with the lithium age.
We speculate on reasons for this difference and introduce new models for
lithium depletion that incorporates both rotation and magnetic field affects.
We also synthesize solar, metal-poor and metal-rich substellar evolutionary
models to better determine the bulk properties of PZ Tel B, showing that PZ Tel
B is probably more massive than previous estimates, meaning the companion is
not a giant exoplanet. We show how PZ Tel B compares to other currently known
age and metallicity benchmark systems and try to empirically test the effects
of dust opacity as a function of metallicity on the near infrared colours of
brown dwarfs. Current models suggest that in the near infrared observations are
more sensitive to low-mass companions orbiting more metal-rich stars. We also
look for trends between infrared photometry and metallicity amongst a growing
population of substellar benchmark objects, and identify the need for more data
in mass-age-metallicity parameter space. [Abridged]

more frequently the progenitor star in archive images. In a few cases, the
progenitor star is a yellow supergiant star. The estimated position in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of these stars is not compatible with the
theoretical tracks of classical single star models. According to several
authors, the mass-loss rates during the red supergiant phase could be
underestimated. We study the impact of an increase of these mass-loss rates on
the position of 12 to 15 M\odot stars at the end of their nuclear life, in
order to reconcile the theoretical tracks with the observed yellow supergiant
progenitors. We perform calculations of 12 to 15 M\odot rotating stellar models
using the Geneva stellar evolution code. To account for the uncertainties in
the mass-loss rates during the RSG phase, we increase the mass-loss rate of the
star (between 3 and 10 times the standard one) during that phase and compare
the evolution of stars undergoing such high mass-loss rates with models
computed with the standard mass-loss prescription. We show that the final
position of the models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram depends on the mass
loss they undergo during the red supergiant phase. With an increased mass-loss
rate, we find that some models end their nuclear life at positions that are
compatible with the observed position of several supernova progenitors. We
conclude that an increased mass-loss rate (whom physical mechanism still need
to be clarified) allows single star models to reproduce simultaneously the
estimated position in the HRD of the YSG SN progenitors, as well as the SN
type.

magnetization. At high temperature the independent Ni2+ and Nd3+ spins
fluctuate fast while at low temperature we observe a slowing down of the
fluctuation of the total magnetization of the dimer because of the insurgence
of antiferromagnetic spin correlations. The relaxation mechanism in [NiNd] at
low temperature is interpreted by a single, temperature dependent, correlation
frequency wc\simT^3.5, which reflects the life time broadening of the exchange
coupled spins via spin-phonon interaction. The proton NMR signal in [NiGd]
could be detected just at room temperature, due to the shortening of relaxation
times when T is decreased. The magnetic properties of [ZnGd] are the ones
expected from a weakly interacting assembly of isolated moments except for
anomalies in the susceptibility and NMR results below 15 K which currently
cannot be explained.

5.1 arcsec (a~750AU), respectively. They also appear to share common proper
motions. Follow-up optical spectroscopy reveals each system to consist of a DA
and a H-rich high-field magnetic white dwarf (HFMWD). Our measurements of the
effective temperatures and the surface gravities of the DA components reveal
both to have larger masses than are typical of field white dwarfs. By assuming
that these degenerates have evolved essentially as single stars, due to their
wide orbital separations, we use them to place limits on the total ages of our
stellar systems. These argue that in each case the HFMWD is probably associated
with an early type progenitor (M_init > 2M_solar). We find that the cooling
time of SDSSJ150746.80+520958.0 (DAH) is somewhat lower than might be expected
had it followed the evolutionary path of a typical single star. This mild
discord is in the same sense as that observed for two of the small number of
other HFMWDs for which progenitor mass estimates have been made, REJ0317-853
and EG59. The mass of the other DAH, SDSSJ092646.88+132134.5, appears to be
smaller than expected on the basis of single star evolution. If this object
was/is a member of a hierarchical triple system it may have experienced greater
mass loss during an earlier phase of its life as a result of it having a close
companion. The large uncertainties on our estimates of the parameters of the
HFMWDs suggest a larger sample of these objects is required to firmly identify
any trends in their inferred cooling times and progenitor masses.

reason effectively, an HTN planner needs expressive domain knowledge. For

expressivity and avoids some task interactions due to the increased complexity

of Lie groups and their representations. After re-deriving the standard
covariant formalism from SO(3) considerations, we provide a new expansion of
the perturbed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in terms of
irreducible representations of the Lorentz group. The resulting decomposition
splits into (scalar, scalar), (scalar, vector) and (vector, vector) terms.
These equations directly correspond to the standard Lifshitz classification of
cosmological perturbations using scalar, vector and tensor modes which arise
from the irreducible SO(3) representation of the spatial part of the metric.
While the Lorentz group basis matches the underlying local symmetries of the
FLRW spacetime better than the SO(3), the new equations do not provide further
simplification compared to the standard cosmological perturbation theory. We
conjecture that this is due to the fact that the so(3,1) ~ su(2) x su(2)
Lorentz algebra has no pair of commuting generators commuting with any of the
translation group generators.

Supernovae (SNe) are hypothesized to emit bursts of high-energy neutrinos on a
time-scale of \lesssim 100 s. While GRB neutrinos would be produced in high
relativistic jets, core-collapse SNe might host soft-relativistic jets, which
become stalled in the outer layers of the progenitor star leading to an
efficient production of high-energy neutrinos. Aims. To increase the
sensitivity to these neutrinos and identify their sources, a low-threshold
optical follow-up program for neutrino multiplets detected with the IceCube
observatory has been implemented. Methods. If a neutrino multiplet, i.e. two or
more neutrinos from the same direction within 100 s, is found by IceCube a
trigger is sent to the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment, ROTSE. The
4 ROTSE telescopes immediately start an observation program of the
corresponding region of the sky in order to detect an optical counterpart to
the neutrino events. Results. No statistically significant excess in the rate
of neutrino multiplets has been observed and furthermore no coincidence with an
optical counterpart was found. Conclusion. The search allows, for the first
time, to set stringent limits on current models predicting a high-energy
neutrino flux from soft relativistic hadronic jets in core-collapse SNe. We
conclude that a sub-population of SNe with typical Lorentz boost factor and jet
energy of 10 and 3\times10^{51} erg, respectively, does not exceed 4.2% at 90%
confidence.

perform complex functions that cannot be written down in analytic form.
Multi-Agent Systems are highly connected, and the information they contain is
mostly stored in the connections. When agents update their state, they take
into account the state of the other agents, and they have access to those
states via the connections. There is also external, user-generated input into
the Multi-Agent System. As so much information is stored in the connections,
agents are often memory-less. This memory-less property, together with the
randomness of the external input, has allowed us to model Multi-Agent Systems
using Markov chains. In this paper, we look at Multi-Agent Systems that evolve,
i.e. the number of agents varies according to the fitness of the individual
agents. We extend our Markov chain model, and define stability. This is the
start of a methodology to control Multi-Agent Systems. We then build upon this
to construct an entropy-based definition for the degree of instability (entropy
of the limit probabilities), which we used to perform a stability analysis. We
then investigated the stability of evolving agent populations through
simulation, and show that the results are consistent with the original
definition of stability in non-evolving Multi-Agent Systems, proposed by Chli
and De Wilde. This paper forms the theoretical basis for the construction of
Digital Business Ecosystems, and applications have been reported elsewhere.

collisionless reconnection of anti-parallel fields is studied using
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and modeling based on the anisotropic
magnetohydrodynamic equations. Large-scale PIC simulations of reconnection and
companion Riemann simulations of shock development demonstrate that the
pressure anisotropy produced by counterstreaming ions within the exhaust
prevents the development of classical Petschek switch-off-slow shocks (SSS).
The shock structure that does develop is controlled by the firehose stability
parameter epsilon=1-mu_0(P_parallel-P_perpendicular)/ B^2 through its influence
on the speed order of the intermediate and slow waves. Here P_parallel and
P_perpendicular are the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the local
magnetic field. The exhaust boundary is made up of a series of two shocks and a
rotational wave. The first shock takes epsilon from unity upstream to a plateau
of 0.25 downstream. The condition epsilon =0.25 is special because at this
value the speeds of nonlinear slow and intermediate waves are degenerate. The
second slow shock leaves epsilon=0.25 unchanged but further reduces the
amplitude of the reconnecting magnetic field. Finally, in the core of the
exhaust epsilon drops further and the transition is completed by a rotation of
the reconnecting field into the out-of-plane direction. The acceleration of the
exhaust takes place across the two slow shocks but not during the final
rotation. The result is that the outflow speed falls below that expected from
the Walen condition based on the asymptotic magnetic field. A simple analytic
expression is given for the critical value of epsilon within the exhaust below

realized in the observed hyperon spectrum. Furthermore, the existence of the
$\Xi(1620)$ and the $\Xi(1690)$ of $j^P=1/2^-$ is predicted by this model.

hyperbolic groups, mapping class groups, $Out(F_n)$, and the Cremona group.
Other examples can be found among groups acting geometrically on $CAT(0)$

although our technique applies to a wide class of groups, it is capable of

have been developed for secured transmission over Internet. In this work, a
scheme for Image encryption/decryption based on Vector Quantization (VQ) has
been proposed that concurrently encodes the images for compression and shuffles
the codebook and the index matrix using pseudorandom sequences for encryption.
The processing time of the proposed scheme is much less than the other
cryptosystems, because it does not use any traditional cryptographic
operations, and instead it performs swapping between the contents of the
codebook with respect to a random sequence, which resulted an indirect
shuffling of the contents of the index matrix. It may be noted that the
security of the proposed cryptosystem depends on the generation and the
exchange of the random sequences used. Since the generation of truly random
sequences are not practically feasible, we simulate the proposed scheme using
MATLAB, where its operators like rand(method, seed), randperm(n) has been used
to generate pseudorandom sequences and it has been seen that the proposed
cryptosystem shows the expected performance.

with highly degenerate eigenvalue spectra of the corresponding connectivity
matrices. In particular, we consider the two cases of a star graph and of a
complete graph, both having one highly degenerate eigenvalue, while displaying
different topologies. While the CTQW spreading over the network - in terms of
the average probability to return or to stay at an initially excited node - is
in both cases very slow, also when compared to the corresponding classical
continuous-time random walk (CTRW), we show how the spreading is enhanced by
randomly adding bonds to the star graph or removing bonds from the complete
graph. Then, the spreading of the excitations may become very fast, even
outperforming the corresponding CTRW. Our numerical results suggest that the
maximal spreading is reached halfway between the star graph and the complete
graph. We further show how this disorder-enhanced spreading is related to the
networks' eigenvalues.

I","accepted by ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/746/1/43",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Angular momentum evolution in low-mass stars is determined by initial
conditions during star formation, stellar structure evolution, and the
behaviour of stellar magnetic fields. Here we show that the empirical picture
of angular momentum evolution arises naturally if rotation is related to
magnetic field strength instead of to magnetic flux, and formulate a corrected
braking law based on this. Angular momentum evolution then becomes a strong
function of stellar radius, explaining the main trends observed in open
clusters and field stars at a few Gyr: the steep transition in rotation at the
boundary to full convection arises primarily from the large change in radius
across this boundary, and does not require changes in dynamo mode or field
topology. Additionally, the data suggest transient core-envelope decoupling
among solar-type stars, and field saturation at longer periods in very low-mass
stars. For solar-type stars, our model is also in good agreement with the
empirical Skumanich law. Finally, in further support of the theory, we show
that the predicted age at which low-mass stars spin down from the saturated to
unsaturated field regimes in our model corresponds remarkably well to the
observed lifetime of magnetic activity in these stars.

characterizations of positive definite functions on spheres in terms of
Gegenbauer expansions and apply them to dimension walks, where monotonicity
properties of the Gegenbauer coefficients guarantee positive definiteness in
higher dimensions. Subject to a natural support condition, isotropic positive

distance by the great circle distance on a one-, two- or three-dimensional

Fibonacci superlattice is considered. The electric field produces a nonlinear
dynamics of the energy spectrum of the aperiodic superlattice. Mechanism of the
nonlinearity is explained in terms of energy levels anticrossings. The
multifractal formalism is applied to investigate the effect of weak electric
field on the statistical properties of electronic eigenfunctions. It is shown
that the applied electric field does not remove the multifractal character of
the electronic eigenfunctions, and that the singularity spectrum remains
non-parabolic, however with a modified shape. Changes of the distances between
energy levels of neighbouring eigenstates lead to the changes of the inverse
participation ratio of the corresponding eigenfunctions in the weak electric
field. It is demonstrated, that the local minima of the inverse participation
ratio in the vicinity of the anticrossings correspond to discontinuity of the
first derivative of the difference between marginal values of the singularity
strength. Analysis of the generalized dimension as a function of the electric
field shows that the electric field correlates spatial fluctuations of the
neighbouring electronic eigenfunction amplitudes in the vicinity of
anticrossings, and the nonlinear character of the scaling exponent confirms
multifractality of the corresponding electronic eigenfunctions.

in neuronal networks. The key problem is to sample from the conditional
distribution of a single neuronal spike train, given the activity of the other
neurons in the network. Dependencies between neurons are usually relatively
weak; however, temporal dependencies within the spike train of a single neuron
are typically strong. In this paper we develop several specialized
Metropolis--Hastings samplers which take advantage of this dependency
structure. These samplers are based on two ideas: (1) an adaptation of fast
forward--backward algorithms from the theory of hidden Markov models to take
advantage of the local dependencies inherent in spike trains, and (2) a
first-order expansion of the conditional likelihood which allows for efficient
exact sampling in the limit of weak coupling between neurons. We also
demonstrate that these samplers can effectively incorporate side information,
in particular, noisy fluorescence observations in the context of
calcium-sensitive imaging experiments. We quantify the efficiency of these
samplers in a variety of simulated experiments in which the network parameters
are closely matched to data measured in real cortical networks, and also
demonstrate the sampler applied to real calcium imaging data.

end, in this paper, we propose an alternative approach to investigate the CSI
feedback rate control problem in the analytical setting of a game theoretic
framework, in which a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with a
number of co-channel MSs through linear precoder. Specifically, we first
present a non-cooperative feedback-rate control game (NFC), in which each MS
selects the feedback rate to maximize its performance in a distributed way. To
improve efficiency from a social optimum point of view, we then introduce
pricing, called the non-cooperative feedback-rate control game with price
(NFCP). The game utility is defined as the performance gain by CSI feedback
minus the price as a linear function of the CSI feedback rate. The existence of
the Nash equilibrium of such games is investigated, and two types of feedback
protocols (FDMA and CSMA) are studied. Simulation results show that by
adjusting the pricing factor, the distributed NFCP game results in close
optimal performance compared with that of the centralized scheme.

computing the distance between any two clusterings, we adopt and provide a much
simpler, but accurate modification of the metric proposed in [In Felicitation

efficient Bayesian methodology, based on [Sankhy\={a} Ser. B 70 (2008)

with the massive data and to obtain samples from the posterior distribution of

  mapping on the nonnegative orthant","24 pages","Mathematics of Operations Research, Vol. 37, Issue 2, 301-312,
  2012",,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A reflection map, induced by the deterministic Skorohod problem on the
nonnegative orthant, is applied to an $\mathbb{R}^n$ valued function $X$ on
$[0,\infty)$ and then to $a+X$, where $a$ is a nonnegative constant vector. A
question that has been open for over 15 years is under what conditions the
difference between the two resulting regulated functions converges to zero for
any choice of $a$ as time diverges. This in turn implies that if one imposes
enough stochastic structure that ensures that the reflection map applied to a
multidimensional process $X$ converges in distribution then it will also
converge in distribution when it is applied to $\eta+X$ where $\eta$ is any
almost surely finite valued random vector that may even depend on the process
$X$. In this paper we obtain a useful equivalent characterization of this
property. As a result we are able to identify a natural sufficient condition in
terms of the given data $X$ and the constant routing matrix. A similar
necessary condition is also indicated. A particular implication of our analysis
is that under additional stochastic assumptions, asymptotic irrelevance of the
initial condition does note require the existence of a stationary distribution.
As immediate corollaries of our (and earlier) results we conclude that under
the natural stability conditions, a reflected L\'evy process as well as Markov
additive process has a unique stationary distribution and converges in
distribution to this stationary distribution for every initial condition.
Extensions of the sufficient condition are then developed for reflection maps
with drift and routing coefficients that may be time and state dependent; some
implications to multidimensional insurance models are briefly discussed.

cooperative networks, consisting of two sources, a number of intermediate
nodes, and one eavesdropper, with the constraints of physical layer security.
Specifically, the proposed algorithms select two or three intermediate nodes to
enhance security against the malicious eavesdropper. The first selected node
operates in the conventional relay mode and assists the sources to deliver
their data to the corresponding destinations using an amplify-and-forward
protocol. The second and third nodes are used in different communication phases
as jammers in order to create intentional interference upon the eavesdropper
node. Firstly, we find that in a topology where the intermediate nodes are
randomly and sparsely distributed, the proposed schemes with cooperative
jamming outperform the conventional non-jamming schemes within a certain
transmitted power regime. We also find that, in the scenario in which the
intermediate nodes gather as a close cluster, the jamming schemes may be less
effective than their non-jamming counterparts. Therefore, we introduce a hybrid
scheme to switch between jamming and non-jamming modes. Simulation results
validate our theoretical analysis and show that the hybrid switching scheme
further improves the secrecy rate.

lines up with previous similar classifications, such as the structures

active galactic nuclei produce relativistic outflows that lead to the formation
of collisionless shock waves, where particle acceleration is thought to take
place. Our understanding of relativistic shock acceleration has improved in the
past decade, thanks to the combination of analytical studies and high level
numerical simulations. In ultra-relativistic shocks, particle acceleration is
made difficult by the generically transverse magnetic field and large advection
speed of the shocked plasma. Fast growing microturbulence is thus needed to
make the Fermi process operative. It is thought, and numerical simulations
support that view, that the penetration of supra-thermal particles in the shock
precursor generates a magnetic turbulence which in turn produces the scattering
process needed for particle acceleration through the Fermi mechanism. Through
the comparison of the growth timescale of the microinstabilities in the shock
precursor and the precursor crossing timescale, it is possible to delimit in
terms of magnetization and shock Lorentz factor the region in which
micro-turbulence may be excited, hence whether and how Fermi acceleration is
triggered. These findings are summarized here and astrophysical consequences
are drawn.

description of many-body (beyond mean field) effects. The long-range character
of the dipole-dipole repulsive interaction between the molecules, which scales
as $1/r^3$ at large distances $r$, makes the problem drastically different from
the well-known problem of the two-species Fermi gas with repulsive contact
interspecies interaction. We solve the low-energy scattering problem and
develop a many-body perturbation theory beyond the mean field. The theory
relies on the presence of a small parameter $k_Fr_*$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi
momentum, and $r_*=md^2/\hbar^2$ is the dipole-dipole length, with $m$ being
the molecule mass. We obtain thermodynamic quantities as a series of expansion
up to the second order in $k_Fr_*$ and argue that many-body corrections to the
ground-state energy can be identified in experiments with ultracold molecules,
like it has been recently done for ultracold fermionic atoms. Moreover, we show
that only many-body effects provide the existence of zero sound and calculate
the sound velocity.

differing radius connected by their common tangents shares many properties with
the conventional ""straight"" stadium, including hyperbolicity and mixing, as
well as intermittency due to marginally unstable periodic orbits (MUPOs).
Interestingly, the roles of the straight and curved sides are reversed. Here we
discuss intermittent properties of the chaotic trajectories from the point of
view of escape through a hole in the billiard, giving the exact leading order
coefficient $\lim_{t\to\infty} t P(t)$ of the survival probability $P(t)$ which
is algebraic for fixed hole size. However, in the natural scaling limit of
small hole size inversely proportional to time, the decay remains exponential.
The big distinction between the straight and drivebelt stadia is that in the
drivebelt case there are multiple families of MUPOs leading to qualitatively
new effects. A further difference is that most marginal periodic orbits in this
system are oblique to the boundary, thus permitting applications that utilise
total internal reflection such as microlasers.

monolithic devices capable of supporting room temperature quantum states

properties. The term Quantum Gravity itself is ambiguous as there are many
proposals for its correct formulation and none of them have been verified
experimentally. In this thesis we consider a number of closely related
approaches to two dimensional quantum gravity that share the property that they
may be formulated in terms of random graphs. In one such approach known as
Causal Dynamical Triangulations, numerical computations suggest an interesting
phenomenon in which the effective spacetime dimension is reduced in the UV. In
this thesis we first address whether such a dynamical reduction in the number
of dimensions may be understood in a simplified model. We introduce a continuum
limit where this simplified model exhibits a reduction in the effective
dimension of spacetime in the UV, in addition to having rich cross-over
behaviour.
  In the second part of this thesis we consider an approach closely related to
causal dynamical triangulation; namely dynamical triangulation. Although this
theory is less well-behaved than causal dynamical triangulation, it is known
how to couple it to matter, therefore allowing for potentially multiple
boundary states to appear in the theory. We address the conjecture of Seiberg
and Shih which states that all these boundary states are degenerate and may be
constructed from a single principal boundary state. By use of the random graph
formulation of the theory we compute the higher genus amplitudes with a single
boundary and find that they violate the Seiberg-Shih conjecture. Finally we
discuss whether this result prevents the replacement of boundary states by
local operators as proposed by Seiberg.

~ 1.8 and 2.7 Mpc west from the cluster centre. The Arecibo Galaxy Environment
survey provided evidence for HI extending over as much as 200kpc in both
groups. Our new, higher resolution observations reveal that the complex HI
features detected by Arecibo are in reality two extraordinary long HI tails
extending for ~160 and 250 kpc, respectively, i.e., among the longest HI
structures ever observed in groups of galaxies. Although in the case of RSCG42
the morphology and dynamics of the HI tail, as well as the optical properties
of the group members, support a low-velocity tidal interaction scenario, less
clear is the origin of the unique features associated with FGC1287. This galaxy
displays an exceptionally long 'dog leg' HI tail and the large distance from
the X-ray emitting region of Abell 1367 makes a ram-pressure stripping scenario
highly unlikely. At the same time a low-velocity tidal interaction seems unable
to explain the extraordinary length of the tail and the lack of any sign of
disturbance in the optical properties of FGC1287. An intriguing possibility
could be that this galaxy might have recently experienced a high-speed
interaction with another member of the Coma-Abell 1367 Great Wall. We searched
for the interloper responsible for this feature and, although we find a
possible candidate, we show that without additional observations it is
impossible to settle this issue. While the mechanism responsible for this
extraordinary HI tail remains to be determined, our discovery highlights how
little we know about environmental effects in galaxy groups.

used, often only, as a technique for (analytically) calculating the power
series of the solution (in terms of the initial value parameters). Sometimes, a
piecewise analytic continuation process is implemented either in a numerical
routine (e.g., within a shooting method) or in a semi-analytical procedure
(e.g., to solve a boundary value problem). Emphasized also is the fact that, at
the time of its invention, the currently-used basic ingredients of the DTM
(that transform a differential equation into a difference equation of same
order that is iteratively solvable) were already known for a long time by the
""traditional""-Taylor-method users (notably in the elaboration of software
packages --numerical routines-- for automatically solving ordinary differential
equations). At now, the defenders of the DTM still ignore the, though much
better developed, studies of the ""traditional""-Taylor-method users who, in
turn, seem to ignore similarly the existence of the DTM. The DTM has been given
an apparent strong formalization (set on the same footing as the Fourier,
Laplace or Mellin transformations). Though often used trivially, it is easily
attainable and easily adaptable to different kinds of differentiation
procedures. That has made it very attractive. Hence applications to various
problems of the Taylor method, and more generally of the power series method
(including noninteger powers) has been sketched. It seems that its potential
has not been exploited as it could be. After a discussion on the reasons of the

at the tree level, on rare decays $B \to K_0^*\pi$. Under two different
scenarios (S1 and S2) for identifying the scalar meson $K_0^*(1430)$, the
branching ratios, CP asymmetries, and isospin asymmetries are calculated in
both the standard model (SM) and the family nonuniversal $Z^\prime$ model. We
find that the branching ratios and CP asymmetries are sensitive to weak
annihilation. In the SM, with $\rho_A=1$ and $\phi_A\in[-30^\circ, 30^\circ]$,
the branching ratios of S1 (S2) are smaller (larger) than the experimental
data. Adding the contribution of the $Z^\prime$ boson in two different cases
(Case-I and Case-II), for S1, the branching ratios are still far away from
experiment. For S2, in Case-II, the branching ratios become smaller and can
accommodate the data; in Case-I, although the center values are enhanced, they
can also explain the data with large uncertainties. Similar conclusions are
also reached for CP asymmetries. Our results indicate that S2 is more favored
than S1, even after considering new physics effects. Moreover, if there exists
a nonuniversal $Z^\prime$ boson, Case-II is preferred. All results can be
tested in the LHC-b experiment and forthcoming super-B factory.

phenomenological parametrizations of the pi N and NN total cross sections at
high energy and a set of sum rules which connect the high and low energy

imperative code written against distributed key/value stores, losing the many
benefits of data independence in the process. Instead, we propose PIQL, a
declarative language that also provides scale independence by calculating an
upper bound on the number of key/value store operations that will be performed
for any query. Coupled with a service level objective (SLO) compliance
prediction model and PIQL's scalable database architecture, these bounds make
it easy for developers to write success-tolerant applications that support an

However, the sheer size and dynamic nature of graph streams present an enormous

optimize the responses to basic queries on graph streams. We consider two
different scenarios for query estimation: (1) A graph stream sample is

optimize the query estimation accuracy. We perform extensive experimental

presents many challenges due to the large amount of data involved and the

Distance (EMD) has increasingly been employed to compare uncertain data due to
its ability to effectively capture the differences between two distributions.
Computing the EMD entails finding a solution to the transportation problem,
which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a new lower bound
to the EMD and an index structure to significantly improve the performance of
EMD based K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) queries on uncertain databases. We propose
a new lower bound to the EMD that approximates the EMD on a projection vector.
Each distribution is projected onto a vector and approximated by a normal
distribution, as well as an accompanying error term. We then represent each
normal as a point in a Hough transformed space. We then use the concept of
stochastic dominance to implement an efficient index structure in the
transformed space. We show that our method significantly decreases K-NN query
time on uncertain databases. The index structure also scales well with database
cardinality. It is well suited for heterogeneous data sets, helping to keep EMD
based queries tractable as uncertain data sets become larger and more complex.

More precisely, we define a size-l OS as a partial OS composed of l important

string into a set of segments and creates inverted indices for the segments.
Then for each string, Pass-Join selects some of its substrings and uses the
selected substrings to find candidate pairs using the inverted indices. We
devise efficient techniques to select the substrings and prove that our method
can minimize the number of selected substrings. We develop novel pruning

measurements on self-organized gold chains on a germanium surface we
reinvestigate the local single-particle spectral properties of Luttinger
liquids. In the first part we use the bosonization approach to exactly compute
the local spectral function of a simplified field theoretical low-energy model
and take a closer look at scaling properties as a function of the ratio of
energy and temperature. Translational invariant Luttinger liquids as well as
those with an open boundary (cut chain geometry) are considered. We explicitly
show that the scaling functions of both setups have the same analytic form. The
scaling behavior suggests a variety of consistency checks which can be
performed on measured data to experimentally verify Luttinger liquid behavior.
In a second part we approximately compute the local spectral function of a
microscopic lattice model---the extended Hubbard model---close to an open
boundary using the functional renormalization group. We show that as a function
of energy and temperature it follows the field theoretical prediction in the
low-energy regime and point out the importance of nonuniversal energy scales
inherent to any microscopic model. The spatial dependence of this spectral
function is characterized by oscillatory behavior and an envelope function
which follows a power law both in accordance with the field theoretical
continuum model. Interestingly, for the lattice model we find a phase shift
which is proportional to the two-particle interaction and not accounted for in
the standard bosonization approach to Luttinger liquids with an open boundary.
We briefly comment on the effects of several one-dimensional branches cutting

underground to be isolated from the seismic motion, the core optics are cooled
down to 20 K to reduce thermal fluctuations, and quantum non-demolition
techniques are used to decrease quantum noise. In this paper, we introduce the

of the X-ray emission at about one stellar radius above the photosphere. From

debated. Maintaining manifest Lorentz covariance seems to require introducing
either complex-valued fields, presenting a significant obstacle to
quantization, or additional (usually second class) constraints whose solution
renders the resulting phase space variables harder to interpret in a spacetime
picture. After reviewing the sources of difficulty, we present a Lorentz
covariant, real formulation in which second class constraints never arise.
Rather than a foliation of spacetime, we use a gauge field y, interpreted as a
field of observers, to break the SO(3,1) symmetry down to a subgroup SO(3)_y.
This symmetry breaking plays a role analogous to that in MacDowell-Mansouri
gravity, which is based on Cartan geometry, leading us to a picture of gravity
as 'Cartan geometrodynamics.' We study both Lorentz gauge transformations and
transformations of the observer field to show that the apparent breaking of
SO(3,1) to SO(3) is not in conflict with Lorentz covariance.

(about 240 MeV/nucleon) one- and two-neutron removal reactions on a carbon
target. Measurements were made of the inclusive cross sections and momentum
distributions for the charged residues. Narrow momentum distributions were
observed for one-neutron removal from $^{19}$C and $^{20}$C and two-neutron
removal from $^{22}$C. Two-neutron removal from $^{20}$C resulted in a
relatively broad momentum distribution. The results are compared with
eikonal-model calculations combined with shell-model structure information. The
neutron-removal cross sections and associated momentum distributions are
calculated for transitions to both the particle-bound and particle-unbound
final states. The calculations take into account the population of the mass
$A-1$ reaction residues, $^{A-1}$C, and, following one-neutron emission after
one-neutron removal, the mass $A-2$ two-neutron removal residues, $^{A-2}$C.
The smaller contributions of direct two-neutron removal, that populate the
$^{A-2}$C residues in a single step, are also computed. The data and
calculations are shown to be in good overall agreement and consistent with the
predicted shell-model ground state configurations and the one-neutron overlaps
with low-lying states in $^{18-21}$C. These suggest significant
$\nu{s}_{1/2}^2$ valence neutron configurations in both $^{20}$C and $^{22}$C.
The results for $^{22}$C strongly support the picture of $^{22}$C as a
two-neutron halo nucleus with a dominant $\nu{s}_{1/2}^2$ ground state
configuration.

copulas of the pairs $(Y_t,Y_{t-k})$ and the independence copula. This object
is called a copula spectral density kernel and allows to separate the marginal
and serial aspects of a time series. We show that this spectrum is closely
related to the concept of quantile regression. Like quantile regression, which
provides much more information about conditional distributions than classical
location-scale regression models, copula spectral density kernels are more
informative than traditional spectral densities obtained from classical
autocovariances. In particular, copula spectral density kernels, in their
population versions, provide (asymptotically provide, in their sample versions)
a complete description of the copulas of all pairs $(Y_t,Y_{t-k})$. Moreover,
they inherit the robustness properties of classical quantile regression, and do
not require any distributional assumptions such as the existence of finite
moments. In order to estimate the copula spectral density kernel, we introduce
rank-based Laplace periodograms which are calculated as bilinear forms of
weighted $L_1$-projections of the ranks of the observed time series onto a
harmonic regression model. We establish the asymptotic distribution of those
periodograms, and the consistency of adequately smoothed versions. The
finite-sample properties of the new methodology, and its potential for
applications are briefly investigated by simulations and a short empirical

the injection of open flux by CMEs and other eruptive events. Making use of
recent advances in heliospheric background subtraction, we have imaged many
abrupt disconnection events. These events produce dense plasma clouds whose
distinctie shape can now be traced from the corona across the inner solar
system via heliospheric imaging. The morphology of each initial event is
characteristic of magnetic reconnection across a current sheet, and the
newly-disconnected flux takes the form of a ""U""-shaped loop that moves outward,
accreting coronal and solar wind material.
  We analyzed one such event on 2008 December 18 as it formed and accelerated
at 20 m/s^2 to 320 km/s, expanding self-similarly until it exited our field of
view 1.2 AU from the Sun. From acceleration and photometric mass estimates we
derive the coronal magnetic field strength to be 8uT, 6 Rs above the
photosphere, and the entrained flux to be 1.6x10^11 Wb (1.6x10^19 Mx). We model
the feature's propagation by balancing inferred magnetic tension force against
accretion drag. This model is consistent with the feature's behavior and
accepted solar wind parameters.
  By counting events over a 36 day window, we estimate a global event rate of
1/day and a global solar minimum unsigned flux disconnection rate of 6x10^13
Wb/y (6x10^21 Mx/y) by this mechanism. That rate corresponds to ~0.2 nT/y
change in the radial heliospheric field at 1 AU, indicating that the mechanism
is important to the heliospheric flux balance.

The
electronic band structure of the AB bilayer in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling and a transverse electric field is calculated from first-principles
using the linearized augmented plane wave method implemented in the WIEN2k
code. The first-principles results around the K points are fitted to a
tight-binding model. The main conclusion is that the spin-orbit effects in
bilayer graphene derive essentially from the single-layer spin-orbit coupling
which comes almost solely from the d orbitals. The intrinsic spin-orbit
splitting (anticrossing) around the K points is about 24\mu eV for the
low-energy valence and conduction bands, which are closest to the Fermi level,
similarly as in the single layer graphene. An applied transverse electric field
breaks space inversion symmetry and leads to an extrinsic (also called
Bychkov-Rashba) spin-orbit splitting. This splitting is usually linearly
proportional to the electric field. The peculiarity of graphene bilayer is that
the low-energy bands remain split by 24\mu eV independently of the applied
external field. The electric field, instead, opens a semiconducting band gap
separating these low-energy bands. The remaining two high-energy bands are
spin-split in proportion to the electric field; the proportionality coefficient
is given by the second intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, whose value is 20\mu eV.
All the band-structure effects and their spin splittings can be explained by
our tight-binding model, in which the spin-orbit Hamiltonian is derived from
symmetry considerations. The magnitudes of intra- and interlayer
couplings---their values are similar to the single-layer graphene ones---are
determined by fitting to first-principles results.
