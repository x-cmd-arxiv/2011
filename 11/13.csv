next 10-15 years the limits imposed by the physics of switch operation will be
the major roadblock for future scaling of the CMOS technology. Among these
limits the most fundamental is represented by the so-called Shannon-von
Neumann-Landauer limit that sets a lower bound to the minimum heat dissipated
per bit erasing operation. Here we show that in a nanoscale switch, operated at
finite temperature T, this limit can be beaten by trading the dissipated energy
with the uncertainty in the distinguishability of switch logic states. We
establish a general relation between the minimum required energy and the
maximum error rate in the switch operation and briefly discuss the potential
applications in the design of future switches.

Our approach provides a novel way to summarize geometric data, such that

coloring sigma from V to {1,...,k} such that sigma(v) is different from
pi_{u,v}(sigma(u)) for all (u,v) in E. Based on arguments from statistical
physics, we conjecture that the threshold d_k for permuted k-colorability in
random graphs G(n,m=dn/2), where the permutations on the edges are uniformly
random, is equal to the threshold for standard graph k-colorability. The
additional symmetry provided by random permutations makes it easier to prove
bounds on d_k. By applying the second moment method with these additional
symmetries, and applying the first moment method to a random variable that
depends on the number of available colors at each vertex, we bound the
threshold within an additive constant. Specifically, we show that for any
constant epsilon > 0, for sufficiently large k we have
  2 k ln k - ln k - 2 - epsilon < d_k < 2 k ln k - ln k - 1 + epsilon.
  In contrast, the best known bounds on d_k for standard k-colorability leave
an additive gap of about ln k between the upper and lower bounds.

two-component terahertz laser pulse in a one-dimensional mesoscopic ring with
Rashba-Dresselhaus spin orbit interactions (SOI) linear in the electron
momentum. The characteristic interference effects result from the opposite
precession directions imposed on the electron spin by the two SOI couplings.
The time dependence of the currents is obtained by solving numerically the
equation of motion for the density operator, which is later employed in
calculating statistical averages of quantum operators on few electron
eigenstates. The parameterization of the problem is done in terms of the SOI
coupling constants and of the phase difference between the two laser
components. Our results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillations is
controlled by the relative strength of the two SOI's, while their frequency is
determined by the difference between the excitation energies of the electron
states. Furthermore, the oscillations of the spin current acquire a beating
pattern of higher frequency that we associate with the nutation of the electron
spin between the quantization axes of the two SOI couplings. This phenomenon
disappears at equal SOI strengths, whereby the opposite precessions occur with
the same probability.

In particular, the maximum principle well-known for the PDEs of elliptic and
parabolic types is extended for the time-fractional diffusion equation. In its
turn, the maximum principle is used to show uniqueness of solution to the
initial-boundary-value problems for the time-fractional diffusion equation. The
generalized solution in sense of Vladimirov is then constructed in form of a
Fourier series with respect to the eigenfunctions of a certain Sturm-Liouville
eigenvalue problem. For the one-dimensional time-fractional diffusion equation
$$ (D_t^{\alpha} u)(t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(p(x) \frac{\partial
u}{\partial x}) -q(x)\, u + F(x,t),\ \ x\in (0,l),\ t\in (0,T) $$ the
generalized solution to the initial-boundary-value problem with the Dirichlet
boundary conditions is shown to be a solution in the classical sense.
Properties of the solution are investigated including its smoothness and
asymptotics for some special cases of the source function.

series at certain special values of their analytic parameter s. These series
arise as coefficients in the R4 and D4R4 interactions in the low energy
expansion of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric string theory
reduced to D=10-d dimensions on a torus T^d, d<8. For each d these amplitudes
are automorphic functions on the rank d+1 symmetry group E_d+1. Of particular
significance is the orbit content of the Fourier modes of these series when
expanded in three different parabolic subgroups, corresponding to certain
limits of string theory. This is of interest in the classification of a variety
of instantons that correspond to minimal or next-to-minimal BPS orbits. In the
limit of decompactification from D to D+1 dimensions many such instantons are
related to charged 1/2-BPS or 1/4-BPS black holes with euclidean world-lines
wrapped around the large dimension. In a different limit the instantons give
nonperturbative corrections to string perturbation theory, while in a third
limit they describe nonperturbative contributions in eleven-dimensional
supergravity. A proof is given that these three distinct Fourier expansions
have certain vanishing coefficients that are expected from string theory. In
particular, the Eisenstein series for these special values of s have markedly
fewer Fourier coefficients than typical ones. The corresponding mathematics
involves showing that the wavefront sets of the Eisenstein series are supported
on only certain coadjoint nilpotent orbits - just the minimal and trivial
orbits in the 1/2-BPS case, and just the next-to-minimal, minimal and trivial
orbits in the 1/4-BPS case. Thus as a byproduct we demonstrate that the
next-to-minimal representations occur automorphically for E6, E7, and E8, and
hence the first two nontrivial low energy coefficients are exotic
theta-functions.

is given by (x_t+1, y_t+1) = (x_t + y_t, x_t + 2y_t) mod N; which acts on a
two-dimensional square coordinate grid of size Nx?N. The defining
characteristic of this map is that it has the property that when the NxN grid
is a picture whose pixels are assigned (x,y) coordinates, the map scrambles the
picture with each iteration. After a finite number of iterations, the picture
is restored to its original shape and order. The number of iterations M, needed
to restore the image, has a mysterious dependence on N. This period, as we will
find out, is directly related to the divisibility of the Fibonacci numbers. We
will exploit this property to show that, for any N, an image is not dense in
itself. In the second half of the paper, we build on the work of Chen, Mao, and
Chui to extend the DCM to three dimensions. Finally, we define the generalized
n dimensional DCM by introducing the idea of a ""matrix union"".

existence of potential function for general processes, which reveals both local

the separate treatment of the proper motions and the line-of-sight velocities

association between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and collapsing massive stars.
A bipolar relativistic jet, launched at the core of a collapsing star, drills
its way through the stellar envelope and breaks out of the surface before
producing the observed gamma-rays. While a wealth of observations associate
GRBs with the death of massive stars, as yet there is no direct evidence for
the Collapsar model itself. Here we show that a distinct signature of the
Collapsar model is the appearance of a plateau in the duration distribution of
the prompt GRB emission at times much shorter than the typical breakout time of
the jet. This plateau is evident in the data of all three major satellites.
These findings provide an evidence that directly supports the Collapsar model.
Additionally, it suggests the existence of a large population of choked
(failed) GRBs and that the 2 s duration commonly used to separate Collapsars
and non-Collapasars is inconsistent with the duration distributions of {\it
Swift} and Fermi GRBs and only holds for BATSE GRBs.

gravity on scales larger than the Hubble radius. It is well known that a
uniformly expanding, homogeneous ball of dust in Newtonian gravity satisfies
the same equations as arise in relativistic FLRW cosmology, and it also is
known that a correspondence between Newtonian and relativistic dust cosmologies
continues to hold in linearized perturbation theory in the marginally
bound/spatially flat case. Nevertheless, it is far from obvious that Newtonian
gravity can provide a good global description of an inhomogeneous cosmology
when there is significant nonlinear dynamical behavior at small scales. We
investigate this issue in the light of a perturbative framework that we have
recently developed, which allows for such nonlinearity at small scales. We
propose a relatively straightforward ""dictionary""---which is exact at the
linearized level---that maps Newtonian dust cosmologies into general
relativistic dust cosmologies, and we use our ""ordering scheme"" to determine
the degree to which the resulting metric and matter distribution solve
Einstein's equation. We find that Einstein's equation fails to hold at ""order
1"" at small scales and at ""order $\epsilon$"" at large scales. We then find the
additional corrections to the metric and matter distribution needed to satisfy
Einstein's equation to these orders. While these corrections are of some
interest in their own right, our main purpose in calculating them is that their
smallness should provide a criterion for the validity of the original
dictionary (as well as simplified versions of this dictionary). We expect that,
in realistic Newtonian cosmologies, these additional corrections will be very
small; if so, this should provide strong justification for the use of Newtonian
simulations to describe relativistic cosmologies, even on scales larger than

and rotation symmetries of the liquid-phase into a discrete lattice of
translations, and a finite group of rotations. Quasicrystals, on the other
hand, possess no such symmetries-there are no translations, nor, in general,
are there any rotations, leaving them invariant. Does this imply that no
symmetry is left, or that the meaning of symmetry should be revised? We review
this and other questions related to the liquid-to-crystal symmetry-breaking
transition using the notion of indistinguishability. We characterize the
order-parameter space, describe the different elementary excitations, phonons
and phasons, and discuss the nature of dislocations-keeping in mind that we are
now living in the age of quasicrystals.

equations are rewritten in a dimensionless renormalized form and solved
numerically as partial differential equations. Perturbative corrections are
included for the spatially inhomogeneous system within a self-consistent
one-loop approximation. The RG flow parameter is determined locally as a
function of space and time by a constraint equation which is solved by a Newton
iteration. As a result we obtain the temperature profile of the interface.
Furthermore we calculate the average order parameter <psi>, the correlation
length xi, the specific heat C_Q and the thermal resistivity rho_T where we
observe a rounding of the critical singularity by the gravity and the heat
current. We compare the thermal resistivity with an experiment and find good
qualitative agreement. Moreover we discuss our previous approach for larger
heat currents and the self-organized critical state and show that our theory
agrees with recent experiments in this latter regime.

describing, for example, intramolecular degrees of freedom. They are treated on
the basis of a reaction surface Hamiltonian approach. Second, a set of bath

  text overlap with arXiv:0705.3503 by other authors",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we consider the problem of information hiding in the scenarios
of interactive systems, statistical disclosure control, and refinement of
specifications. We apply quantitative approaches to information flow in the
first two cases, and we propose improvements for the usual solutions based on
process equivalences for the third case. In the first scenario we consider the
problem of defining the information leakage in interactive systems where
secrets and observables can alternate during the computation and influence each
other. We show that the information-theoretic approach which interprets such
systems as (simple) noisy channels is not valid. The principle can be recovered
if we consider channels with memory and feedback. We also propose the use of
directed information from input to output as the real measure of leakage in
interactive systems. In the second scenario we consider the problem of
statistical disclosure control, which concerns how to reveal accurate
statistics about a set of respondents while preserving the privacy of
individuals. We focus on the concept of differential privacy, a notion that has
become very popular in the database community. We show how to model the query
system in terms of an information-theoretic channel, and we compare the notion
of differential privacy with that of min-entropy leakage.In the third scenario
we address the problem of using process equivalences to characterize
information-hiding properties. We show that, in the presence of nondeterminism,
this approach may rely on the assumption that the scheduler ""works for the
benefit of the protocol"", and this is often not a safe assumption. We present a
formalism in which we can specify admissible schedulers and, correspondingly,
safe versions of complete-trace equivalence and bisimulation, and we show that
safe equivalences can be used to establish information-hiding properties.

composed of a rigid mantle and a triaxial cavity filled with inviscid fluid of
constant uniform density and vorticity. In considering an Io-like body on a low
eccentricity orbit, we describe the different possible behaviors of the system,
depending on the size, polar flattening and shape of the core.
  We use for that the numerical tool. We propagate numerically the Hamilton
equations of the systems, before expressing the resulting variables under a
quasi-periodic representation. This expression is obtained numerically by
frequency analysis. This allows us to characterize the equilibria of the
system, and to distinguish the causes of their time variations.
  We show that, even without orbital eccentricity, the system can have complex
behaviors, in particular when the core is highly flattened. In such a case, the
polar motion is forced by several degrees and longitudinal librations appear.
This is due to splitting of the equilibrium position of the polar motion. We
also get a shift of the obliquity when the polar flattening of the core is
small.
