UV and XMM-Newton data we derive the spectral energy distribution (SED) from
the optical/UV to X-ray regime of a sizeable sample of AGN. The principal
motivation is to investigate the relationship between the optical/UV emission

current physical cosmology. We construct and study the X-ray to optical SED of
a sample of 195 X-ray selected Type 1 AGN belonging to the XMM-Newton bright
serendipitous survey (XBS). The optical-UV luminosity was computed using data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), from our own dedicated optical
spectroscopy and the satellite Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), while the
X-ray luminosity was computed using XMM-Newton data. Because it covers a wide
range of redshift (0.03 < z < 2.2), X-ray luminosities (41.8 < logL[2-10]keV <
45.5 erg/s) and because it is composed of ""bright objects"", this sample is
ideal for this kind of investigation. We find a correlation between kbol and
the hard X-ray photon index {\Gamma}(2-10keV) and a tight correlation between

both {\Gamma}(2-10keV) and {\alpha}ox can be used as a proxy for kbol.

the number of covariates is very large, potentially greater than the sample

well approximated by a fit involving only a small number of covariates -- a so
called sparsity assumption, which leads to the Lasso and other methods. In many
situations, however, the covariates can be considered to be structured, in that
the selection of some variables favours the selection of others -- with
variables organised into groups entering or leaving the model simultaneously as
a special case. This structure creates a different form of sparsity. In this
paper, we suggest the Co-adaptive Lasso to fit models accommodating this form
of `group sparsity'. The Co-adaptive Lasso is fast and simple to calculate, and
we show that it holds theoretical advantages over the Lasso, performs well

of IC348 members taking into account recent updates to the cluster census. Our
data collection comprises fundamental stellar parameters, infrared excess
indicating the presence of disks, Halpha emission as a tracer of chromospheric
emission or accretion and mass accretion rates. We have detected 290 X-ray
sources in four merged Chandra exposures, of which 187 are associated with
known cluster members. Only four of the X-ray sources are brown dwarfs
(spectral type M6 and later). The detection rate is highest for diskless Class
III stars and increases with stellar mass. This may be explained with higher
X-ray luminosities for higher mass and later evolutionary stage that is evident
in the X-ray luminosity functions. In particular, we find that for the lowest
examined masses (0.1-0.25 Msun) there is a difference between the X-ray
luminosity functions of accreting and non-accreting stars (classified on the
basis of their Halpha emission strength) as well as those of disk-bearing and
diskless stars (classified on the basis of the slope of the spectral energy
distribution). These differences disappear for higher masses. This is related
to our finding that the L_x/L_bol ratio is non-constant across the
mass/luminosity sequence of IC348 with a decrease towards lower luminosity
stars. Our analysis of an analogous stellar sample in the Orion Nebula Cluster
suggests that the decline of L_x/L_ bol for young stars at the low-mass end of
the stellar sequence is likely universal.

fingerprint of inter-site electronic correlations. In a magnetic field
$\mathbf{H}$ applied along the easy-axis $\bf{c}$, the vanishing of this
high-temperature scale precedes the polarization of the magnetic moments, as
well as it drives the destabilization of the hidden-order phase. Strongly
impurity-dependent magnetoresistivity confirms that the Fermi surface is
reconstructed below $T_0$ and is strongly modified in a high magnetic field
applied along $\mathbf{c}$, i.e. at a sufficiently-high magnetic polarization.
The possibility of a sharp crossover in the hidden-order state controlled by a
field-induced change of the Fermi surface is pointed out.

a number of weak gravitational lensing studies. An emphasis is put on the
correction of systematic effects in the photo-z's arising from the different
Point Spread Functions (PSF) in the five optical bands. Different ways of
correcting these effects are discussed and the resulting photo-z accuracies are
quantified by comparing the photo-z's to large spectroscopic redshift (spec-z)
data sets. Careful homogenisation of the PSF between bands leads to increased
overall accuracy of photo-z's. The gain is particularly pronounced at fainter
magnitudes where galaxies are smaller and flux measurements are affected more
by PSF-effects. We also study possible re- calibrations of the photometric
zeropoints (ZPs) with the help of galaxies with known spec-z's. We find that if
PSF-effects are properly taken into account, a re-calibration of the ZPs
becomes much less important suggesting that previous such re-calibrations
described in the literature could in fact be mostly corrections for PSF-effects
rather than corrections for real inaccuracies in the ZPs. The implications of
this finding for future surveys like KiDS, DES, LSST, or Euclid are mixed. On
the one hand, ZP re-calibrations with spec-z's might not be as accurate as
previously thought. On the other hand, careful PSF homogenisation might provide
a way out and yield accurate, homogeneous photometry without the need for full
spectroscopic coverage. This is the first paper in a series describing the

oppositely charged colloidal system close to either gelation and/or
crystallization, colloids with a competing short-range depletion attraction and
a long-range electrostatic repulsion, colloidal dipolar chains, and colloidal
gold platelets under conditions where they formed stacks. Important differences
in the structure formation were observed between the experiments where the
particles were allowed to sediment and those where sedimentation was averaged
out. For instance, in the case of colloids interacting via long-range
electrostatic repulsions, an unusual sequence of
dilute-Fluid/dilute-Crystal/dense-Fluid/dense-Crystal phases was observed
throughout the suspension under the effect of gravity, related to the volume
fraction dependence of the colloidal interactions, whereas the system stayed
homogeneously crystallized with rotation. For the oppositely charged colloids,
a gel-like structure was found to collapse under the influence of gravity with
a few crystalline layers grown on top of the sediment, whereas when the
colloidal sedimentation was averaged out, the gel completely transformed into
crystallites that were oriented randomly throughout the sample. Rotational
averaging out gravitational sedimentation is an effective and cheap way to
estimate the importance of gravity for colloidal self-assembly processes.

interstellar medium (ISM) environments found in the nearby Universe. Its broad
goals are to characterize the ISM of present-day galaxies, the heating and
cooling of their gaseous and dust components, and to better understand the
physical processes linking star formation and the ISM. KINGFISH is a direct
descendant of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), which
produced complete Spitzer imaging and spectroscopic mapping and a comprehensive
set of multi-wavelength ancillary observations for the sample. The Herschel
imaging consists of complete maps for the galaxies at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350,
and 500 microns. The spectal line imaging of the principal atomic ISM cooling
lines ([OI]63um, [OIII]88um, [NII]122,205um, and [CII]158um) covers the
subregions in the centers and disks that already have been mapped in the
mid-infrared with Spitzer. The KINGFISH and SINGS multi-wavelength datasets
combined provide panchromatic mapping of the galaxies sufficient to resolve
individual star-forming regions, and tracing the important heating and cooling
channels of the ISM, across a wide range of local extragalactic ISM
environments. This paper summarizes the scientific strategy for KINGFISH, the
properties of the galaxy sample, the observing strategy, and data processing
and products. It also presents a combined Spitzer and Herschel image atlas for
the KINGFISH galaxies, covering the wavelength range 3.6 -- 500 microns. All

the velocity vector field in the respective dynamical systems in response to
external, generally random, stimuli. With this, a mathematical concept of
self-shaping dynamical systems is proposed. Initially there is a zero vector
field and an ""empty"" phase space with no attractors or other non-trivial
objects. As the random stimulus begins, the vector field deforms and eventually
becomes smooth and deterministic, despite the random nature of the applied
force, while the phase space develops various geometrical objects. We consider
gradient self-shaping systems, whose vector field is the gradient of some
energy function, which under certain conditions develops into the
multi-dimensional probability density distribution (PDD) of the input.
Self-shaping systems are relevant to neural networks (NNs) of two types:
Hopfield, and probabilistic. Firstly, we show that they can potentially perform
pattern recognition tasks traditionally delegated to Hopfield NNs, but without
supervision and on-line, and without developing spurious minima of the energy.
Secondly, like probabilistic NNs, they can reconstruct the PDD of input
signals, without the limitation that new training patterns have to enter as new
hardware units. Thus, self-shaping systems can be regarded as a generalization
of the NN concept, achieved by abandoning the ""rigid units"" - ""flexible
couplings"" paradigm and making the vector field fully flexible and amenable to
external force. The new concept presents an engineering challenge requiring new
principles of hardware design. It might also become an alternative paradigm for
modeling of living and learning systems.

the shape set are usually given the structure of a group, more particularly a
cyclic group. In a more general setting, any object could be defined by its

paper is to determine the structure of simply transitive groups of

of transformations are obtained, including the traditional ones such as the
dihedral groups. The knowledge of the group structure and product allows to
explicitly build group actions on the objects. In particular we differentiate
between left and right group actions and we show how they are related to
non-contextual and contextual transformations. Finally we show how group

a system coupled to a microcanonical bath the concept of free energy does {\it

Lagrangian displacement field, motivated by the success of a logarithmic
transformation in restoring information to the matter power spectrum. The
logarithmic relation is an extension of the linear relation, motivated by the
continuity equation, in which the density field is assumed to be proportional
to the divergence of the displacement field; we compare the linear and
logarithmic relations by measuring both of these fields directly in a
cosmological N-body simulation. The relative success of the logarithmic and
linear relations depends on the scale at which the density field is smoothed.
Thus we explore several ways of measuring the density field, including
Cloud-In-Cell smoothing, adaptive smoothing, and the (scale-independent)
Delaunay tessellation, and we use both a Fourier space and a geometrical
tessellation approach to measuring the divergence. We find that the relation
between the divergence of the displacement field and the density is
significantly tighter with a logarithmic density variable, especially at low
redshifts and for very small (~2 Mpc/h) smoothing scales. We find that the
grid-based methods are more reliable than the tessellation-based method of
calculating both the density and the divergence fields, though in both cases
the logarithmic relation works better in the appropriate regime, which
corresponds to nonlinear scales for the grid-based methods and low densities
for the tessellation-based method.

of localizations which are themselves cluster algebras. A `locally acyclic
cluster algebra' is a cluster algebra which admits a finite cover (in a
geometric sense) by acyclic cluster algebras. Many important results about
acyclic cluster algebras extend to local acyclic cluster algebras (such as
finite generation, integrally closure, and equaling their upper cluster
algebra), as well as results which are new even for acyclic cluster algebras
(such as regularity when the exchange matrix has full rank).
  We develop several techniques for determining whether a cluster algebra is
locally acyclic. We show that cluster algebras of marked surfaces with at least
two boundary marked points are locally acyclic, providing a large class of
examples of cluster algebras which are locally acyclic but not acyclic. We also
work out several specific examples in detail.

its reduced functional determinant by the method of the Faddeev-Popov gauge

the previously known result for the single-node case of one oscillation of the

analysis reveals PAH features in only a minority (30%) of the objects with good
IRS spectra. Using the wealth of complementary data available for the 2Jy and

far-IR excess and PAH detection. There is good agreement between the various

close link between starburst and powerful radio-loud AGN activity, reinforcing
the view that, although a large fraction of powerful radio galaxies may be

understood. Subgrid models of AGN activity in a galaxy evolution context so far
have been mostly focused on the quenching of star formation. To shed more light
on the actual physics of the ""radio mode"" part of AGN activity, we have
performed simulations of the interaction of a powerful AGN jet with the massive
gaseous disc (10^11 solar masses) of a high-redshift galaxy. We spatially
resolve both the jet and the clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and
include an explicit star formation model in the simulation. Following the
system over more than 10^7 years, we find that the jet activity excavates the
central region, but overall causes a significant change to the shape of the
density probability distribution function and hence the star formation rate due
to the formation of a blast wave with strong compression and cooling in the
ISM. This results in a ring- or disc-shaped population of young stars. At later
times, the increase in star formation rate also occurs in the disc regions
further out since the jet cocoon pressurizes the ISM. The total mass of the
additionally formed stars may be up to 10^10 solar masses for one duty cycle.

exhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disk,
compared to the higher mass T Tauri stars in Taurus. For nearly all of our

signs of dust processing observed in these disks. For the case of one brown

radial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical
composition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in
this disk. The relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outer
cold regions of brown dwarf disks provides an interesting analogy to comets. In
this context, we have discussed the applicability of the various mechanisms

quantitatively, with the signals for the two classes of hierarchies

immersed in a vertically shaken bed of smaller particles rises to the top, even
when it is much denser. The usual practice, while describing these experiments,
has been to use the dimensionless acceleration \Gamma=a \omega^2/g, where a and
\omega are respectively the amplitude and the angular frequency of vibration
and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Considering a vibrated
quasi-two-dimensional bed of mustard seeds, we show here that the peak-to-peak
velocity of shaking v= a\omega, rather than \Gamma, is the relevant parameter
in the regime where boundary-driven granular convection is the main driving
mechanism. We find that the rise-time \tau of an intruder is described by the
scaling law \tau ~ (v-v_c)^{-\alpha}, where v_c is identified as the critical
vibration velocity for the onset of convective motion of the mustard seeds.

separated by distances of the order of 1 pc, is strongly influenced by the
tidal gravitational potential of the Galaxy. The Coriolis component of the
horizontal tidal force in the rotating reference frame tends to disrupt such
marginally bound pairs. However, even extremely wide pairs of bodies can be
bound over intervals of time comparable to the Hubble time, under appropriate
initial conditions. Here we show that for arbitrary chosen initial coordinates
of a pair of stars, there exists a volume of the space of initial velocity
components where the orbits remain bound in the planar tidal field for longer
than 10 Gyr, even though the initial separation is well outside the Jacobi
radius. The boundary of this phase space of stable orbits is fractal, and the
motion at the boundary conditions is clearly chaotic. We found that the pairs
may remain confined for several Gyr, and then suddenly disintegrate due to a
particularly close rendezvous. By reversing such long-term stable orbits, we
find that entrapment of unrelated stars into wide pairs is possible, but should
be quite rare. Careful analysis of precision astrometry surveys revealed that
extremely wide pairs of stars are present in significant numbers in the Galaxy.
These results are expected to help discriminating the cases of genuine binarity
and chance entrapment, and to make inroads in testing the limits of Newtonian
gravitation.

major unsolved problem in astrophysics. SN Ia rates are providing some striking
clues. We review the basics of SN rate measurement, preach about some sins of
SN rate measurement and analysis, and illustrate one of these sins with an
analogy about Martian scientists. We review the recent progress in measuring SN
Ia rates in various environments and redshifts, and their use to reconstruct
the SN Ia delay time distribution (DTD) -- the SN rate versus time that would
follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation. A good number of DTD
measurements, using a variety of methods, appear to be converging. At delays
1<t<10 Gyr, these measurements show a similar, ~t^-1, power-law shape. The DTD
peaks at the shortest delays probed, although there is still some uncertainty
regarding its precise shape at t<1 Gyr. At face value, this result supports the
idea of a double-degenerate progenitor origin for SNe Ia. Single-degenerate
progenitors may still play a role in producing short-delay SNe Ia, or perhaps
all SNe Ia, if the red-giant donor channel is more efficient than found by most
theoretical models. Apart from the DTD shape, the DTD normalization enjoys
fairly good agreement (though perhaps some tension), among the various
measurements, with a Hubble-time-integrated DTD value of about 2+/- 1 SNe Ia
per 1000 Msun (stellar mass formed with a low-mass-turnover IMF). A recent
attempt to characterize the local white dwarf binary population suggests that
the white dwarf merger rate can explain the Galactic SN Ia rate, if sub-Chandra
mergers lead to SN Ia events. We conclude by pointing to some future directions
that should lead to progress in the field, including measurement of the
bivariate (delay and stretch) SN Ia response function .

selected covariates follow some structure over the candidate covariates that is
assumed to be known a priori. While sparsity is well studied in many settings,
including aggregation, structured sparse methods are still emerging. We
demonstrate a general framework for structured sparse aggregation that allows
for a wide variety of structures, including overlapping grouped structures and
general structural penalties defined as set functions on the set of covariates.
We show that such estimators satisfy structured sparse oracle inequalities ---
their finite sample risk adapts to the structured sparsity of the target. These
inequalities reveal that under suitable settings, the structured sparse
estimator performs at least as well as, and potentially much better than, a
sparse aggregation estimator. We empirically establish the effectiveness of the
method using simulation and an application to HIV drug resistance.

we present a first approach at the problem of energy efficiency for file
distribution. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the general problem of
minimizing energy consumption in file distribution in heterogeneous settings is
NP-hard. For homogeneous settings, we derive tight lower bounds on energy
consumption, and we design a family of algorithms that achieve these bounds.
Our results prove that collaborative p2p schemes achieve up to 50% energy
savings with respect to the best available centralized file distribution
scheme. Through simulation, we demonstrate that in more realistic cases (e.g.,
considering network congestion, and link variability across hosts) we validate
this observation, since our collaborative algorithms always achieve significant
energy savings with respect to the power consumption of centralized file
distribution systems.

reversal at the beginning of 2008, after about 18 years of steadily spinning
down. The main goal of the present work is to study this recent torque reversal
that occurred in 2008 February.
  Methods. We present a spectral analysis of this source using two pointed
observations performed by Suzaku in 2006 March and in 2010 September.
  Results. We confirm with Suzaku the presence of a strong emission-line
complex centered on 1 keV, with the strongest line being the hydrogen-like Ne
Ly-alpha at 1.025(3) keV. We were able to resolve this complex with up to seven
emission lines. A dramatic increase of the intensity of the Ne Ly-alpha line
after the 2008 torque reversal occurred, with the equivalent width of this line
reaching almost the same value measured by ASCA in 1993. We also report on the
detection of a cyclotron line feature centered at ~37 keV. In spite of the fact
that an increase of the X-ray luminosity (0.5-100 keV) of a factor of ~2.8
occurred between these two observations, no significant change in the energy of
the cyclotron line feature was observed. However, the intensity of the ~1 keV
line complex increased by an overall factor of ~8.
  Conclusions. Our results favor a scenario in which the neutron star in 4U
1626-67 accretes material from a geometrically thin disk during both the
spin-up and spin-down phases.

and environmental constraints on the dark matter density may exclude a large
range of \tilde{m} from the reheating temperature after inflation down to
values that yield a LSP mass of order a TeV. After selection effects, the
distribution for \tilde{m} may prefer larger values. A single environmental
constraint from dark matter can then lead to multi-component dark matter,
including both axions and the LSP, giving a TeV-scale LSP lighter than the
corresponding value for single-component LSP dark matter.
  If SUSY breaking is mediated to the SM sector at order X^* X, only squarks,
sleptons and one Higgs doublet acquire masses of order \tilde{m}. The gravitino
mass is lighter by a factor of M_*/M_Pl and the gaugino masses are suppressed
by a further loop factor. This Spread SUSY spectrum has two versions; the
Higgsino masses are generated in one from supergravity giving a wino LSP and in
the other radiatively giving a Higgsino LSP. The environmental restriction on
dark matter fixes the LSP mass to the TeV domain, so that the squark and
slepton masses are order 10^3 TeV and 10^6 TeV in these two schemes. We study
the spectrum, dark matter and collider signals of these two versions of Spread
SUSY. The Higgs is SM-like and lighter than 145 GeV; monochromatic photons in
cosmic rays arise from dark matter annihilations in the halo; exotic short
charged tracks occur at the LHC, at least for the wino LSP; and there are the
eventual possibilities of direct detection of dark matter and detailed
exploration of the TeV-scale states at a future linear collider. Gauge coupling
unification is as in minimal SUSY theories.
  If SUSY breaking is mediated at order X, a much less hierarchical spectrum
results---similar to that of the MSSM, but with the superpartner masses 1--2
orders of magnitude larger than in natural theories.

firing rate propagation in feedforward neuronal network coupled in an
all-to-all fashion. In contrast to most earlier work, where only reliable
synaptic connections are considered, we mainly examine the effects of
unreliable synapses on both types of neural activity propagation in this work.
We first study networks composed of purely excitatory neurons. Our results show
that both the successful transmission probability and excitatory synaptic
strength largely influence the propagation of these two types of neural
activities, and better tuning of these synaptic parameters makes the considered
network support stable signal propagation. It is also found that noise has
significant but different impacts on these two types of propagation. The
additive Gaussian white noise has the tendency to reduce the precision of the
synfire activity, whereas noise with appropriate intensity can enhance the
performance of firing rate propagation. Further simulations indicate that the
propagation dynamics of the considered neuronal network is not simply
determined by the average amount of received neurotransmitter for each neuron
in a time instant, but also largely influenced by the stochastic effect of
neurotransmitter release. Second, we compare our results with those obtained in
corresponding feedforward neuronal networks connected with reliable synapses
but in a random coupling fashion. We confirm that some differences can be
observed in these two different feedforward neuronal network models. Finally,
we study the signal propagation in feedforward neuronal networks consisting of
both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and demonstrate that inhibition also
plays an important role in signal propagation in the considered networks.

0.059) spectroscopically confirmed type Ic supernova, SN 2010bh, associated
with the soft, long-duration gamma-ray burst (X-ray flash) GRB 100316D.
Intensive follow-up observations of SN 2010bh were performed at the ESO Very
Large Telescope (VLT) using the X-shooter and FORS2 instruments. Owing to the
detailed temporal coverage and the extended wavelength range (3000--24800 A),
we obtained an unprecedentedly rich spectral sequence among the hypernovae,
making SN 2010bh one of the best studied representatives of this SN class. We
find that SN 2010bh has a more rapid rise to maximum brightness (8.0 +/- 1.0
rest-frame days) and a fainter absolute peak luminosity (L_bol~3e42 erg/s) than
previously observed SN events associated with GRBs. Our estimate of the ejected
(56)Ni mass is 0.12 +/- 0.02 Msun. From the broad spectral features we measure
expansion velocities up to 47,000 km/s, higher than those of SNe 1998bw (GRB
980425) and 2006aj (GRB 060218). Helium absorption lines He I lambda5876 and He
I 1.083 microm, blueshifted by ~20,000--30,000 km/s and ~28,000--38,000 km/s,
respectively, may be present in the optical spectra. However, the lack of
coverage of the He I 2.058 microm line prevents us from confirming such
identifications. The nebular spectrum, taken at ~186 days after the explosion,
shows a broad but faint [O I] emission at 6340 A. The light-curve shape and
photospheric expansion velocities of SN 2010bh suggest that we witnessed a
highly energetic explosion with a small ejected mass (E_k ~ 1e52 erg and M_ej ~
3 Msun). The observed properties of SN 2010bh further extend the heterogeneity
of the class of GRB supernovae.

achieving reliable data backup in distributed storage systems. During the
storage process, traditional erasure codes require a unique source node to
create and upload all the redundant data to the different storage nodes.
However, such a source node may have limited communication and computation
capabilities, which constrain the storage process throughput. Moreover, the
source node and the different storage nodes might not be able to send and
receive data simultaneously -- e.g., nodes might be busy in a datacenter
setting, or simply be offline in a peer-to-peer setting -- which can further
threaten the efficacy of the overall storage process. In this paper we propose
an ""in-network"" redundancy generation process which distributes the data
insertion load among the source and storage nodes by allowing the storage nodes
to generate new redundant data by exchanging partial information among
themselves, improving the throughput of the storage process. The process is
carried out asynchronously, utilizing spare bandwidth and computing resources
from the storage nodes. The proposed approach leverages on the local
repairability property of newly proposed erasure codes tailor made for the
needs of distributed storage systems. We analytically show that the performance
of this technique relies on an efficient usage of the spare node resources, and
we derive a set of scheduling algorithms to maximize the same. We
experimentally show, using availability traces from real peer-to-peer
applications as well as Google data center availability and workload traces,
that our algorithms can, depending on the environment characteristics, increase
the throughput of the storage process significantly (up to 90% in data centers,
and 60% in peer-to-peer settings) with respect to the classical naive data
insertion approach.

edge vibrations will flip between a pair of doubly degenerate warping states
during the mechanical oscillation of nanoresonators. The flipping process
breaks the coherence of the mechanical oscillation of the nanoresonator, which
is the dominant mechanism for extremely low quality factors. There is an
artificial effect if the mechanical oscillation of the graphene nanoresonator

graph Laplacian matrix, which is proportion to $O(n^3)$ and thus is not
suitable for large scale systems. Recently, many methods have been proposed to
accelerate the computational time of spectral clustering. These approximate
methods usually involve sampling techniques by which a lot information of the
original data may be lost. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate
spectral clustering approach using an approximate commute time embedding, which
is similar to the spectral embedding. The method does not require using any
sampling technique and computing any eigenvector at all. Instead it uses random
projection and a linear time solver to find the approximate embedding. The
experiments in several synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed
approach has better clustering quality and is faster than the state-of-the-art
approximate spectral clustering methods.

field approaches. In particular, we utilize a model-independent selection rule
based on first integrals, due to Noether symmetries of the equations of motion,
in order to identify the viability of $f(R)$ models in the context of flat FLRW
cosmologies. The Lie/Noether point symmetries are computed for six modified
gravity models that include also a cold dark matter component. As it is
expected, we confirm that all the proposed modified gravity models admit the
trivial first integral namely energy conservation. We find that only the
$f(R)=(R^{b}-2\Lambda)^{c}$ model, which generalizes the concordance $\Lambda$
cosmology, accommodates extra Lie/Noether point symmetries. For this $f(R)$
model the existence of non-trivial Noether (first) integrals can be used to
determine the integrability of the model. Indeed within this context we solve
the problem analytically and thus we provide for the first time the evolution
of the main cosmological functions such as the scale factor of the universe and
the Hubble expansion rate.

dioxide at high-pressure high-temperature conditions are calculated from first
principles, using the LSDA+U approach for the electronic structure and the
Debye model for the lattice vibrations. The phonon contribution on Frenkel
pairs is found to be notable, whereas it is negligible for the Schottky defect.
Hydrostatic compression changes the formation energies drastically, making
defect concentrations depend more sensitively on pressure. Calculations show
that, if no oxygen clusters are considered, uranium vacancy becomes predominant
in overstoichiometric UO2 with the aid of the contribution from lattice
vibrations, while compression favors oxygen defects and suppresses uranium
vacancy greatly. At ambient pressure, however, the experimental observation of
predominant oxygen defects in this regime can be reproduced only in a form of
cuboctahedral clusters, underlining the importance of defect clustering in
UO2+x. Making use of the point defect model, an equation of state for
non-stoichiometric oxides is established, which is then applied to describe the
shock Hugoniot of UO2+x. Furthermore, the oxidization and compression behavior
of uranium monoxide, triuranium octoxide, uranium trioxide, and a series of
defective UO2 at zero Kelvin are investigated. The evolution of mechanical
properties and electronic structures with an increase of the oxidation degree
are analyzed, revealing the transition of the groundstate of uranium oxides
from metallic to Mott insulator and then to charge-transfer insulator due to
the interplay of strongly correlated effects of 5f orbitals and the shift of
electrons from uranium to oxygen atoms.

quantum-mechanical vibrational contributions. The analysis relies on
multitemperature (5-295 K) single-crystal neutron-diffraction data. Vibrational
frequencies extracted from the temperature dependence of the ADPs are in good
agreement with THz spectroscopic data. Aspects of the static disorder revealed
by this work, primarily tilting and displacement of the molecules, are compared

Monte Carlo simulations; their salient findings are reproduced by this work,
demonstrating that the faster NCA approach provides reliable constraints for
the interpretation of diffuse scattering. The dielectric properties of PCNB can
thus be rationalized by an interpretation of the temperature-dependent ADPs in
terms of thermal motion and molecular disorder. The use of atomic displacement
parameters in the NCA approach is nonetheless hostage to reliable neutron data.
The success of this study demonstrates that state-of-the-art single-crystal
Laue neutron diffraction affords sufficiently fast the accurate data for this
type of study. In general terms, the validation of this work opens up the field

or Seyfert-like activity (68%), while the remaining 10 galaxies are classified
as either star forming (16%) or quiescent (16%). A comparison to the emission
line activity in the ongoing mergers from Darg et al. indicates that the AGN
fraction rises in the post-mergers, suggesting that the AGN phase probably
becomes dominant only in the very final stages of the merger process. The
optical colours of the SPMs and the plausible mass ratios for their progenitors
indicate that, while a minority are consistent with major mergers between two
early-type galaxies, the vast majority are remnants of major mergers where at
least one progenitor is a late-type galaxy.

  Energy?","4 pages",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We define gravitational mass operator of a hydrogen atom in the
post-Newtonian approximation of the General Relativity and show that it does
not commute with energy operator. Nevertheless, the equivalence between the
expectation values of gravitational mass and energy is shown to survive for
stationary quantum states. Inequivalence between gravitational mass and energy
at a microscopic level reveals itself as unusual electromagnetic radiation,
emitted by the atoms, supported and moved in the Earth gravitational field,
which can be experimentally measured. Inequivalence between gravitational mass
and energy at a macroscopic level results in time dependent oscillations of the
expectation values of gravitational mass for mixed quantum states.

Eldar and Arie Feuer and Zvi Friedman","Compressed Beamforming Applied to B-Mode Ultrasound Imaging","4 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emerging sonography techniques often imply increasing in the number of
transducer elements involved in the imaging process. Consequently, larger
amounts of data must be acquired and processed by the beamformer. The
significant growth in the amounts of data effects both machinery size and power
consumption. Within the classical sampling framework, state of the art systems
reduce processing rates by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected
signals. It has been recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate
reduction may be obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite
Rate of Innovation framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which
combines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in
Compressed Sensing. Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual
transducer elements, which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is
limited by the noisy nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous
parameter extraction, bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the
low-rate samples. In our work, we manage to achieve such SNR enhancement, by
beamforming the sub-Nyquist samples obtained from multiple elements. We refer
to this process as ""compressed beamforming"". Applying it to cardiac ultrasound
data, we successfully image macroscopic perturbations, while achieving a nearly
eight-fold reduction in sample-rate, compared to standard techniques.
