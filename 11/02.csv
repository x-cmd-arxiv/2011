decays for relatively short times and a power-law decay for larger times. In
this interval of N decoherence occurs for short times and a non-Markovian

symmetry is softly broken by the trilinear A-terms in order to obtain the
measured quark masses and the CKM matrix of the Standard Model (SM) at low

approach. We have focused on disordered systems, addressing two traditional
problems in three spatial dimensions: the Edwards-Anderson spin glass and the
Diluted Antiferromagnet in a Field (the physical realisation of the
random-field Ising model). These systems have been studied by means of
large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, exploiting a variety of platforms, which
include the Janus special-purpose supercomputer. Two main themes are explored
throughout: a) the relationship between the (experimentally unreachable)
equilibrium phase and the non-equilibrium evolution and b) the computation and
efficient treatment of rugged free-energy landscapes.
  We perform a thorough study of the low-temperature phase of the D=3
Edwards-Anderson spin glass, where we establish a time-length dictionary and a
finite-time scaling formalism to link, in a quantitative way, the experimental
non-equilibrium regime and the finite-size equilibrium phase. At the
experimentally relevant scales, the replica symmetry breaking theory emerges as
the appropriate theoretical picture.
  We also introduce Tethered Monte Carlo, a general strategy for the study of
systems with rugged free-energy landscapes. This formalism provides a general
method to guide the exploration of the configuration space by constraining one
or more reaction coordinates. From these tethered simulations, the Helmholtz
potential associated to the reaction coordinates is reconstructed, yielding all
the information about the system. We use this method to provide a comprehensive
picture of the critical behaviour in the Diluted Antiferromagnet in a Field.

$x<0.5$, we consider the two-band Double Exchange Model for manganites with
added Jahn-Teller coupling and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg term. In order to
calculate Curie and N\'{e}el temperatures we derive an effective Heisenberg
model for a vector which describes the local orientation of the total
magnetization of the system. The exchange constants of this model are different
for different space directions and depend on the density of $e_g$ electrons,
antiferromagnetic constants and the Jahn-Teller energy. To reproduce the well
known phase transitions from A-type antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism at low
$x$ and C-type antiferromagnetism to G-type antiferromagnetism at large $x$, we
argue that the antiferromagnetic exchange constants should depend on the
lattice direction. We show that ferromagnetic to A-type antiferromagnetic
transition results from the Jahn-Teller distortion. Accounting adequately for
the magnon-magnon interaction, Curie and N\'{e}el temperatures are calculated.
The results are in very good agreement with the experiment and provide values
for the model parameters, which best describe the behavior of the critical
temperature for $x<0.5$.

will call this the Minimal Dimensionless Standard Model (MDSM). In fact, 3
closely related models fit the bill: MDSM_1, MDSM_2 and MDSM_3. We analyze the
theoretical and observational constraints on these models. We argue that, when
they are minimally coupled to gravity, they can accomplish several important
cosmological tasks (inflation, dark matter, leptogenesis) in a way that is
economical, predictive and tightly woven into the fabric of known physics. One
of the models (MDSM_3), which includes an extra U(1)_{B-L} gauge symmetry,

  Probabilistic Generalized Addition (PGA) and Probabilistic Generalized
Multiplication (PGM) operations on correlated random variables are defined and
their basic properties identified and described: \bullet Proposed PGA and PGM
operations possess inverse operations - subtraction and division. \bullet There
is no difference between direct and inverse operations: addition and
subtraction, multiplication and division (this is why these operations are
called ""Generalized""). \bullet Division by approximately zero is possible and
the result never equals to \infty, making this approach promising in
computational and computer mathematics. \bullet Unlike the usual hyperbola,
which, when the argument is changing from + \infty to 0, has a gap at 0, the
Generalized Probabilistic Hyperbola, under certain combination of initial
accuracies, is continuous at 0. First, as the argument changes from +\infty to
0, it behaves like a typical hyperbola, monotonically increasing. However,
after reaching certain maximum value, it starts to decrease to 0 monotonically.
Last property gives a hope that the proposed approach might be promising in
Quantum Physics, as it would allow a more adequate description of macro and
micro physics, as well as of the transition from one to the other.

correctly computes a minimal free resolution in two cases of interest:

linear resolution over the integers, and that the projective dimension depends
only on the number of columns of the matrix which are identically zero.

crucially on statistical analysis (as well as many other ingredients) for their
conclusions. The nature of these experiments leads to a simple class of
statistical models for the results; however, which model in the class is
appropriate is not known exactly, as this depends on information obtained
experimentally, which is subject to noise and other errors. To obtain robust
conclusions, this problem, known as ""model uncertainty,"" needs to be addressed,
with quantitative bounds on the effect such uncertainty may have on the final
result.
  The OPERA (and MINOS) analysis appears to take steps to mitigate the effects
of model uncertainty, though without quantifying any remaining effect. We
describe one of the strategies used (averaging individual probability
distributions), and point out a potential source of error if this is not
carried out correctly. We then argue that the correct version of this strategy
is not the most effective, and suggest possible alternatives. These
alternatives may give more accurate statistical results using the same data,
allowing, for example, more accurate determination of the dependence of the
anomalous time shift on energy. Which strategies work and how well can only be
evaluated with access to the full data.
  Whether or not the anomalous result from OPERA turns out to be confirmed, we
believe that techniques such as those presented here may be appropriate for the

GRB 110205A at redshift z= 2.22. The optical prompt emission was detected by
Swift/UVOT, ROTSE-IIIb and BOOTES telescopes when the GRB was still radiating
in the gamma-ray band. Nearly 200 s of observations were obtained
simultaneously from optical, X-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of the
exceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6
orders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. By fitting the
time resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, an
interesting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard GRB
synchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. Although the prompt
optical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit X/gamma-ray
spectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation to
the prompt high energy emission. The synchrotron + SSC scenario is disfavored
by the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having two
emission regions can interpret the data well. Shortly after prompt emission (~
1100 s), a bright (R = 14.0) optical emission hump with very steep rise (alpha
~ 5.5) was observed which we interpret as the emission from the reverse shock.
It is the first time that the rising phase of a reverse shock component has
been closely observed. The full optical and X-ray afterglow lightcurves can be
interpreted within the standard reverse shock (RS) + forward shock (FS) model.
In general, the high quality prompt emission and afterglow data allow us to
apply the standard fireball shock model to extract valuable information about
the GRB including the radiation mechanism, radius of prompt emission R, initial
Lorentz factor of the outflow, the composition of the ejecta, as well as the
collimation angle and the total energy budget.

$I-tA,$ where $A$ is the weighted adjacency matrix of a weighted multigraph and
$t$ is a sufficiently small positive parameter. In addition, this

we extend it to cold DM (CDM). The collisionless and linearized
Boltzmann-Vlasov equations (B-V) for WDM and neutrinos in the presence of
photons and coupled to the linearized Einstein equations are studied in detail
in the presence of anisotropic stress with the Newtonian potential generically
different from the spatial curvature perturbations. We recast this full system
of B-V equations for DM and neutrinos into a system of coupled Volterra
integral equations. These Volterra-type equations are valid both in the
radiation dominated (RD) and matter dominated (MD) eras during which the WDM
particles are ultrarelativistic and then nonrelativistic. This generalizes the
so-called Gilbert integral equation only valid for nonrelativistic particles in
the MD era. We succeed to reduce the system of four Volterra integral equations
for the density and anisotropic stress fluctuations of DM and neutrinos into a
system of only two coupled Volterra equations. The kernels and inhomogeneities
in these equations are explicitly given functions. Combining the
Boltzmann-Vlasov equations and the linearized Einstein equations constrain the
initial conditions on the distribution functions and gravitational potentials.
In the absence of neutrinos the anisotropic stress vanishes and the
Volterra-type equations reduce to a single integral equation. These Volterra
integral equations provide a useful and precise framework to compute the
primordial WDM fluctuations over a wide range of scales including small scales
up to k ~ 1/5 kpc.

massive star formation is indeed possible. We perform the first realistic
N-body computations of fully mass-segregated R136-type star clusters in which
all the massive stars are in primordial binary systems. These calculations
confirm that the dynamical ejection of a VMS from a R136-like cluster, with
kinematic properties similar to those of VFTS 682, is common. Hence the
conjecture of isolated massive star formation is unnecessary to account for
this VMS. Our results are also quite consistent with the ejection of 30 Dor
016, another suspected runaway VMS from R136. We further note that during the
clusters' evolution, mergers of massive binaries produce a few single stars per
cluster with masses significantly exceeding the canonical upper-limit of 150
solar mass. The observations of such single super-canonical stars in R136,
therefore, do not imply an IMF with an upper limit greatly exceeding the
accepted canonical 150 solar mass limit, as has been suggested recently, and
they are consistent with the canonical upper limit.

with this picture. However, it was recently reported that the orbit of planet b

lacks the inclination to warp the disk. We explore three scenarios for
reconciling the apparent misalignment of the directly imaged planet Beta
Pictoris b with the warped inner disk of Beta Pictoris: observational
uncertainty, an additional planet, and damping of planet b's inclination. We
find that, at the extremes of the uncertainties, the orbit of Beta Pictoris b
has the inclination necessary to produce the observed warp. We also find that
if planet b were aligned with the flat outer disk, it would prevent another
planet from creating a warp with the observed properties; therefore planet b
itself must be responsible for the warp. Finally, planet b's inclination could
have been damped by dynamical friction and still produce the observed disk
morphology, but the feasibility of damping depends on disk properties and the
presence of other planets. More precise observations of the orbit of planet b
and the position angle of the outer disk will allow us to distinguish between
the first and third scenario.

a, the density contrast grows with k for k < k_c while it decreases for k >
k_c, (k_c ~ 1.6/Mpc). The density contrast depends on k and a mainly through
the product k a exhibiting a self-similar behavior. Our numerical density
contrast for small k gently approaches our analytic solution for k = 0. For
fixed k < 1/(60 kpc), the density contrast generically grows with a while for k

maximum at k = k_c reflecting the time evolution of the density contrast. The

the destruction of newly-formed dust grains by sputtering in the reverse shocks

dense, spherical clump, we implant a population of Lagrangian particles into
the clump to represent a distribution of dust grains in size and composition.
We vary the relative velocity between the reverse shock and ejecta clump to
explore the effects of shock-heating and cloud compression. Because supernova
ejecta will be metal-enriched, we consider gas metallicities from Z/Zsun = 1 to
100 and their influence on cooling properties of the cloud and the thermal
sputtering rates of embedded dust grains. We post-process the simulation output
to calculate grain sputtering for a variety of species and size distributions.
In the metallicity regime considered in this paper, the balance between
increased radiative cooling and increased grain erosion depends on the impact
velocity of the reverse shock. For slow shocks (velocity less than or equal to
3000 km/s), the amount of dust destruction is comparable across metallicities,
or in some cases is decreased with increased metallicity. For higher shock
velocities (velocity greater than or equal to 5000 km/s), an increase in
metallicity from Z/Zsun = 10 to 100 can lead to an additional 24% destruction
of the initial dust mass. While the total dust destruction varies widely across
grain species and simulation parameters, our most extreme cases result in
complete destruction for some grain species and only 44% dust mass survival for
the most robust species. These survival rates are important in understanding
how early supernovae contribute to the observed dust masses in high-redshift
galaxies.

every field of astronomy and astrophysics, from the Solar system to cosmology.
Time domain astronomy is being enabled by the advent of the new generation of
synoptic sky surveys that cover large areas on the sky repeatedly, and
generating massive data streams. Their scientific exploration poses many
challenges, driven mainly by the need for a real-time discovery,
classification, and follow-up of the interesting events. Here we describe the
Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), that discovers and publishes
transient events at optical wavelengths in real time, thus benefiting the
entire community. We describe some of the scientific results to date, and then
focus on the challenges of the automated classification and prioritization of
transient events. CRTS represents a scientific and a technological testbed and
precursor for the larger surveys in the future, including the Large Synoptic

non-Gaussian measured variables the latent variables typically influence both
the dependence structure and the form of the marginal distributions,
complicating interpretation and introducing artifacts. To address this problem
we propose a novel class of Bayesian Gaussian copula factor models which
decouple the latent factors from the marginal distributions. A semiparametric
specification for the marginals based on the extended rank likelihood yields
straightforward implementation and substantial computational gains, critical
for scaling to high-dimensional applications. We provide new theoretical and

different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different times, have to
meet at the same node. Agents are anonymous (identical), execute the same
deterministic algorithm and move in synchronous rounds along links of the
network. Which configurations are gatherable and how to gather all of them
deterministically by the same algorithm?
  We give a complete solution of this gathering problem in arbitrary networks.
We characterize all gatherable configurations and give two universal
deterministic gathering algorithms, i.e., algorithms that gather all gatherable
configurations. The first algorithm works under the assumption that an upper
bound n on the size of the network is known. In this case our algorithm
guarantees gathering with detection, i.e., the existence of a round for any
gatherable configuration, such that all agents are at the same node and all
declare that gathering is accomplished. If no upper bound on the size of the
network is known, we show that a universal algorithm for gathering with
detection does not exist. Hence, for this harder scenario, we construct a
second universal gathering algorithm, which guarantees that, for any gatherable
configuration, all agents eventually get to one node and stop, although they
cannot tell if gathering is over. The time of the first algorithm is polynomial
in the upper bound n on the size of the network, and the time of the second
algorithm is polynomial in the (unknown) size itself.
  Our results have an important consequence for the leader election problem for
anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs. For anonymous agents in graphs, leader
election turns out to be equivalent to gathering with detection. Hence, as a
by-product, we obtain a complete solution of the leader election problem for
anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs.

models on the basis of a high-dimensional data set with observations that

might wish to estimate a gene expression network for the normal tissue and a
gene expression network for the tumor tissue. We expect the two gene expression
networks to be similar but not identical to each other, and so more accurate
estimation of these two networks may be possible using a joint approach. We
propose the joint graphical lasso for this purpose. Rather than estimating a
graphical model for each class separately, or a single graphical model across
all classes, we borrow strength across the classes in order to estimate
multiple graphical models that share certain characteristics, such as the
locations or weights of nonzero edges. Our approach is based upon maximizing a
penalized log likelihood. We employ fused lasso or group lasso penalties, and
implement a very fast computational approach that solves the joint graphical
lasso problem. In a simulation study we demonstrate that our proposed approach
leads to more accurate estimation of networks and covariance structure than
competing approaches. We further illustrate our proposal on a

estimate the accelerating parallel electric field dependence on radius, under
the assumptions that the high-energy emission is dominated by curvature
radiation and the geometry (radius of emission and minimum radius of curvature
of the magnetic field lines) is determined by the best fitting light curves for

Upon correcting energies of measured nuclear levels for shell and pairing

proportion to the square of isospin, allowing for an interpretation of the
coefficient of proportionality in terms of a symmetry coefficient for a given
nucleus. In the (A,Z) regions where there are enough data, we demonstrate a
Z-independence of that coefficient. We further concentrate on the A-dependence
of the coefficient, in order to learn about the density dependence of symmetry
energy in uniform matter, given the changes of the density in the surface
region. In parallel to the analysis of data, we carry out an analysis of the
coefficient for nuclei calculated within the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF)
approach, with known symmetry energy for uniform matter. While the data from
isobaric analog states suggest a simple interpretation for the A-dependent
symmetry coefficient, in terms of the surface and volume symmetry coefficients,
the SHF results point to a more complicated situation within the isovector

counts after a log-likelihood ratio transformation (the `Berk-Jones

statistic has a superior performance to the Berk-Jones statistic in the case of
very sparse alternatives (sparsity coefficient $\beta \gtrapprox 0.75$), while
the situation is reversed for $\beta \lessapprox 0.75$. The average likelihood

set in a domain with boundary to solutions of the Euler equations in the large
Reynolds number limit is a challenging open problem both in 2 and 3 space
dimensions. In particular it is distinct from the question of existence in the
large of a smooth solution of the initial-boundary value problem for the Euler
equations. The present paper proposes three results in that direction. First,
if the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations satisfy a slip boundary
condition with vanishing slip coefficient in the large Reynolds number limit,
we show by an energy method that they converge to the classical solution of the
Euler equations on its time interval of existence. Next we show that the
incompressible Navier-Stokes limit of the Boltzmann equation with Maxwell's
accommodation condition at the boundary is governed by the Navier-Stokes
equations with slip boundary condition, and we express the slip coefficient at
the fluid level in terms of the accommodation parameter at the kinetic level.
This second result is formal, in the style of [Bardos-Golse-Levermore, J. Stat.

of the Boltzmann equation set in a domain with boundary with Maxwell's

set the overall luminosity scale of the observed bursts. When combined with a
measured blackbody normalization, this leads to a distance and anisotropy
independent measurement of the ratio between the redshift 1+z and color
correction factor f_c. We find 1+z=1.19-1.28 for f_c=1.4-1.5. We then compare
the evolution of the blackbody normalization with flux in the cooling tail of
bursts with predictions from spectral models of Suleimanov et al. (2011b). The
observations are well described by the models at luminosities greater than
about one third of the peak luminosity, with deviations emerging at
luminosities below that. We show that this comparison leads to distance

algorithm monotonically minimizes an elegant underlying k-means-like clustering
objective that includes a penalty for the number of clusters. We generalize
this analysis to the case of clustering multiple data sets through a similar
asymptotic argument with the hierarchical Dirichlet process. We also discuss
further extensions that highlight the benefits of our analysis: i) a spectral
relaxation involving thresholded eigenvectors, and ii) a normalized cut graph
clustering algorithm that does not fix the number of clusters in the graph.

First, clustering effects are investigated in the structure function F_2 of
Be-9 for explaining an unusual nuclear correction found in a JLab experiment.
We propose that high densities created by formation of clustering structure
like 2*alpha+neutron in Be-9 is the origin of the unexpected JLab result by
using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD). There is an approved
proposal at JLab to investigate the structure functions of light nuclei
including the cluster structure, so that much details will become clear in a
few years. Second, tensor-polarized quark and antiquark distributions are
obtained by analyzing HERMES measurements on the structure function b_1 for the
deuteron. The result suggests a finite tensor polarization for antiquark
distributions, which is an interesting topic for further theoretical and
experimental investigations. An experimental proposal exists at JLab for
measuring b_1 of the deuteron as a new tensor-structure study in 2010's.
Furthermore, the antiquark tensor polarization could be measured by polarized
deuteron Drell-Yan processes at hadron facilities such as J-PARC and GSI-FAIR.
Third, the recent CDF dijet anomaly is investigated within the standard model
by considering possible modifications of the strange-quark distribution. We
find that the shape of a dijet-mass spectrum changes depending on the
strange-quark distribution. It indicates that the CDF excess could be partially
explained as a PDF effect, particularly by the strangeness in the nucleon,
within the standard model if the excess at m_{jj}~140 GeV is not a sharp peak.

These two findings are combined to form a theory that may potentially explain

protein aggregation. Hence, complex organisms tend to be diploid because they
tend to synthesize long, aggregation-prone proteins. On the other hand, simple
organisms tend to be haploid because they synthesize short proteins that are
less prone to aggregation. The theory may also explain ecological trends
associated with organisms of different ploidy level. Two mathematical models
are also developed that may explain: 1) how protein aggregation results in
truncation selection that maintains numerous polymorphisms in natural

Heisenberg limit ({\Delta}=0), there exist finite temperature phase transitions
for the two kinds of DH lattices above. The systems are also investigated in
the range of -\infty<{\Delta}<0 and it is found that they exhibit XY-like fixed

calculated. The results show that for the lattice with d_{f}=2.58, the value of
the Ising critical exponent {\nu}_{I} is the same as that of classical Ising
model and the isotropic Heisenberg critical exponent {\nu}_{H} is a finite
value, and for the lattice with d_{f}=3, the values of {\nu}_{I} and {\nu}_{H}
agree well with those obtained on the simple cubic lattice. We also discuss the
quantum fluctuation at all temperatures and find the fluctuation of XY-like
model is stronger than the anistropic Heisenberg model at the low-temperature

Here $d(x, y)$ denotes the Hamming distance between the two strings $x$ and

  1. a variant of {\em Consensus String with Outliers} where the number of
outliers $k$ is fixed and the objective is to minimize the total distance
$\sum_{s_i \in S^*} d(s_i, s)$ admits a simple PTAS. (ii) Under the natural
assumption that the number of outliers $k$ is small, the PTAS for the distance
minimization version of {\em Consensus String with Outliers} performs well. In
particular, as long as $k\leq cn$ for a fixed constant $c < 1$, the algorithm
provides a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution in time
$f(1/\epsilon)(n\ell)^{O(1)}$ and thus, is an EPTAS.
  2. In order to improve the PTAS for {\em Consensus String with Outliers} to
an EPTAS, the assumption that $k$ is small is necessary. Specifically, when $k$
is allowed to be arbitrary the {\em Consensus String with Outliers} problem
does not admit an EPTAS unless FPT=W[1]. This hardness result holds even for
binary alphabets.
  3. The decision version of {\em Consensus String with Outliers} is fixed
parameter tractable when parameterized by $\frac{d}{n-k}$. and thus, also when
parameterized by just $d$.
  To the best of our knowledge, {\em Consensus String with Outliers} is the
first problem that admits a PTAS, and is fixed parameter tractable when
parameterized by the value of the objective function but does not admit an
EPTAS under plausible complexity assumptions.

engineers as these attacks cannot be defended by traditional cryptography-based
mechanisms. In this paper, a security solution is proposed for detecting
compromised and faulty nodes in a WSN. The mechanism also isolates a
compromised node from the network so that it cannot participate in any network
activity. The proposed mechanism is based on misbehavior classification,

packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially

The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make
the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient
network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is
fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election

Within each investment style we matched every ETF with all the passive index

the period 2002-2010. We then applied the Wilcoxon signed rank test to examine
if ETFs had better performances than index mutual funds during the sample

index mutual funds in 134 of the times in terms of Sharpe Ratio, however, the

emission, absorption, and Compton scattering. Shell-averaged temperature is,
except for the lowest resolution run, nearly independent of resolution;
shell-averaged plasma \beta\ decreases steadily with resolution but shows signs
of convergence. The azimuthal correlation lengths of density, internal energy,
and temperature decrease steadily with resolution but show signs of
convergence. In contrast, the azimuthal correlation length of magnetic field
decreases nearly linearly with grid size. We argue by analogy with local
models, however, that convergence should be achieved with another factor of 2
in resolution. Synthetic spectra are, except for the lowest resolution run,
nearly independent of resolution. The convergence behavior is consistent with
that of higher physical resolution local model (shearing box) calculations and
with the recent nonrelativistic global convergence studies of Hawley et al.

the challenges of terrestrial life, it is important to understand the
mechanistic basis of water transport through these tissues from soil to the
canopy of trees, in some cases almost 100 meters high. The answers to these
questions involve not only the biology of plant vasculature, but also the
physical properties of water that enable such transport. Although early
researchers proposed the hypothesis of cohesion-tension of water as the likely
mechanism for sap ascent, the exact mechanism of transport continues to be a
hotly debated topic in the field of plant physiology. This debate continues to
be enriched with several sophisticated studies on plants of various
morphologies growing in diverse habitats. Although a wealth of evidence has
upheld the cohesion-tension theory as being fundamentally correct, several
important details about how plants deal with vascular stress remain unknown.

  1. For any eps > 0, we show the existence of an n vertex graph G where every
set of o(n) vertices has expansion 1 - eps, but G's adjacency matrix has more
than exp(log^delta n) eigenvalues larger than 1 - eps, where delta depends only

improving over the previously known gadget with blowup of 2^K.
  3. An n variable integrality gap for Unique Games that that survives
exp(poly(log log n)) rounds of the SDP + Sherali Adams hierarchy, improving on
the previously known bound of poly(log log n).

set expansion in certain related Cayley graphs, and use this connection to
derandomize the noise graph on the Boolean hypercube.

Yahoo! front page module. Our approach is based on a novel multilevel
hierarchical model that we refer to as a User Profile Model with Graphical
Lasso (UPG). The UPG provides a personalized recommendation to users by
simultaneously incorporating both user covariates and historical user
interactions with items in a model based way. In fact, we build a per-item
regression model based on a rich set of user covariates and estimate individual
user affinity to items by introducing a latent random vector for each user. The
vector random effects are assumed to be drawn from a prior with a precision
matrix that measures residual partial associations among items. To ensure
better estimates of a precision matrix in high-dimensions, the matrix elements
are constrained through a Lasso penalty. Our model is fitted through a
penalized-quasi likelihood procedure coupled with a scalable EM algorithm. We
employ several computational strategies like multi-threading, conjugate
gradients and heavily exploit problem structure to scale our computations in
the E-step. For the M-step we take recourse to a scalable variant of the
Graphical Lasso algorithm for covariance selection. Through extensive
experiments on a new data set obtained from Yahoo! front page and a benchmark
data set from a movie recommender application, we show that our UPG model
significantly improves performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods
in the literature, especially those based on a bilinear random effects model
(BIRE). In particular, we show that the gains of UPG are significant compared
to BIRE when the number of users is large and the number of items to select
from is small. For large item sets and relatively small user sets the results
of UPG and BIRE are comparable. The UPG leads to faster model building and
produces outputs which are interpretable.

multifluid MHD plasma with parameters matching those of a typical molecular
cloud. The instability is capable of transforming well-ordered flows into
disordered flows. As a result, it may be able to convert the energy found in,
for example, bowshocks from stellar jets into the turbulent energy found in
molecular clouds. As these clouds are weakly ionised, the ideal
magnetohydrodynamic approximation does not apply at scales of around a tenth of
a parsec or less. This paper extends the work of Jones & Downes (2011) on the
evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the presence of multifluid
magnetohydrodynamic effects. These effects of ambipolar diffusion and the Hall
effect are here studied together under physical parameters applicable to
molecular clouds. We restrict our attention to the case of a single shear layer
with a transonic, but super-Alfvenic, velocity jump and the computational
domain is chosen to match the wavelength of the linearly fastest growing mode
of the instability.
  We find that while the introduction of multifluid effects does not affect the
linear growth rates of the instability, the non-linear behaviour undergoes
considerable change. The magnetic field is decoupled from the bulk flow as a
result of the ambipolar diffusion, which leads to a significant difference in
the evolution of the field. The Hall effect would be expected to lead to a
noticeable re-orientation of the magnetic field lines perpendicular to the

that the proximity effect can be strong enough to induce a gap in the surface

field lines plays an important role in the evolution of the kink instability in
coronal loops. This study presents the observational signatures of the kink
instability in long coronal loops when parallel thermal conduction is included.
The 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic equations are solved numerically to
simulate the evolution of a coronal loop that is initially in an unstable
equilibrium. The loop has length 80 Mm, width 8 Mm and an initial maximum twist
of Phi = 11.5 pi, where Phi is a function of the radius. The initial loop
parameters are obtained from a highly twisted loop observed in the TRACE 171 A
waveband. Synthetic observables are generated from the data. These observables
include spatial and temporal averaging to account for the resolution and
exposure times of TRACE images. Parallel thermal conduction reduces the maximum
local temperature by up to an order of magnitude. This means that different
spectral lines are formed and different internal loop structures are visible
with or without the inclusion of thermal conduction. However, the response
functions sample a broad range of temperatures. The result is that the
inclusion of parallel thermal conductivity does not have as large an impact on
observational signatures as the order of magnitude reduction in the maximum
temperature would suggest; the net effect is a blurring of internal features of
the loop structure.

of the physical conditions in the blue (B2) and red-shifted (R) lobes to
compare the excitation conditions. A total of 5 ortho- and para-H216O plus one
o-H218O transitions were observed in B2 and R with a wide range of excitation
energies (27 K<=Eu<=215 K). The H2O spectra, observed in the two shocked
regions, show that the H2O profiles are markedly different in the two regions.
In particular, at the bow-shock R, we observed broad (~30 km s-1 with respect
to the ambient velocity) red-shifted wings where lines at different excitation
peak at different red-shifted velocities. The B2 spectra are associated with a
narrower velocity range (~6 km s-1), peaking at the systemic velocity. The
excitation analysis suggests, for B2, low values of column density NH2O
<=5{\times}1013 cm-2, a density range of 105 <=nH2 <=107 cm-3, and warm
temperatures (>=300 K). The presence of the broad red-shifted wings and
multiple peaks in the spectra of the R region, prompted the modelling of two
components. High velocities are associated with relatively low temperatures
(~100K),NH2O{\simeq}5{\times}1012-5{\times}1013 cm-2 and densities

external massive star-forming regions in a sample of (U)LIRGs. We use high
angular resolution ACS images from the HST B and I bands, as well as
Halpha-line emission maps obtained with IFS. We find 31 external
Halpha-emitting (young star-forming) complexes in 11 (U)LIRGs. These complexes
have in general similar sizes, luminosities, and metallicities to extragalactic
giant HII regions and TDG candidates found in less luminous mergers and compact
groups of galaxies. We assess the mass content and the likelihood of survival
as TDGs of the 22 complexes with simple structures in the HST images based on
their photometric, structural, and kinematic properties. The dynamical tracers
used (radius-sigma and luminosity-sigma diagrams) indicate that most of the
complexes might be self-gravitating entities. The resistance to forces from the
parent galaxy is studied by considering the tidal mass of the candidate and its
relative velocity with respect to the parent galaxy. After combining the
results of previous studies of TDG searches in ULIRGs a total of 9 complexes
satisfy most of the applied criteria and thus show a high-medium or high
likelihood of survival, their total mass likely being compatible with that of
dwarf galaxies. They are defined as TDG candidates. We propose that they
probably formed more often during the early phases of the interaction.
Combining all data for complexes with IFS data where a significant fraction of
the system is covered, we infer a TDG production rate of 0.3 candidates with
the highest probabilities of survival per system for the (U)LIRGs class. This
rate, though, might decrease to 0.1 after the systems in (U)LIRGs have evolved
for 10 Gyr, for long-lived TDGs, which would imply that no more than 5-10 % of
the overall dwarf population could be of tidal origin.

character of commutation relations for operators of the atomic representation
can induce pseudogap behavior of the spectral characteristics of an ensemble of
Hubbard fermions. Mathematically, the presence of the kinematic interaction
manifests itself in modification of the faithful representation of a
single-particle Green's function of Hubbard fermions $D(\textbf{k},i\omega_n)$,
which involves, apart from self-energy operator
$\Sigma_L(\textbf{k},i\omega_n)$, strength operator $P(\textbf{k},i\omega_n)$.
It is important that the strength operator enters both the numerator and the
denominator of the exact expression for $D(\textbf{k},i\omega_n)$. The
kinematic interaction, therefore, not only renormalizes the spectrum of
elementary excitations but significantly affects their spectral weight. It
results in strong modulation of spectral intensity $A(\textbf{k},\omega)$
occurring on a Fermi contour. Calculations of the spectral properties for the
$t-J$ model in the one-loop approximation yield good quantitative agreement
with the ARPES data obtained on cuprate superconductors.

functions measured in $PbPb$ and $pp$ collisions appear very similar in spite
of a large medium-induced energy loss (we will call this ""jet fragmentation
scaling"", JFS). To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the
propagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we
adopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$
quasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of
the coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of
""mesons"" with a finite mass and the screening of ""quark"" charge that are
crucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that
this approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$
annihilation at $z\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion
measurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta). In QCD medium, we
find that the JFS is reproduced if the mean free path $\lambda$ of the jet is
short, $\lambda \leq 0.3$ fm, which is in accord with the small shear viscosity
inferred from the measurements of the collective flow. The JFS holds since at
short mean free path the quantum interference (analogous to the
Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED) causes the produced mesons to have low
momenta $p \sim m$, where $m \simeq 0.6$ GeV is the typical meson mass.
Meanwhile the induced jet energy loss at short mean free path is much larger
than naively expected in string models.

strongly coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field stored in a
cavity, a research field named cavity quantum electrodynamics or CQED. CQED has
recently received renewed attention due to its implementation with
superconducting artificial atoms and coplanar resonators in the so-called
circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. In cQED, the couplings can
be much stronger than in CQED due to the design flexibility of superconducting
circuits and to the enhanced field confinement in one-dimensional cavities.
This enabled the realization of fundamental quantum physics and quantum
information processing experiments with a degree of control comparable to that
obtained in CQED.
  The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the situation where the
resonator to which the atom is coupled is made nonlinear with a Kerr-type
nonlinearity, causing its energy levels to be nonequidistant. The system is
then described by a nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. This considerably
enriches the physics since a pumped nonlinear resonator displays bistability,
parametric amplification, and squeezing. The interplay of strong coupling and
these nonlinear effects constitutes a novel model system for quantum optics
that can be implemented experimentally with superconducting circuits.
  This chapter is organized as follows. In a first section we present the
system consisting of a superconducting Kerr nonlinear resonator strongly
coupled to a transmon qubit. In the second section, we describe the response of
the sole nonlinear resonator to an external drive. In the third section, we
show how the resonator bistability can be used to perform a high-fidelity
readout of the transmon qubit. In the last section, we investigate the quantum
backaction exerted by the intracavity field on the qubit.

improve the coverage and performance of next-generation wireless networks. In
this paper, we propose a framework for macrocell-femtocell cooperation under a
closed access policy, in which a femtocell user may act as a relay for
macrocell users. In return, each cooperative macrocell user grants the
femtocell user a fraction of its superframe. We formulate a coalitional game
with macrocell and femtocell users being the players, which can take individual
and distributed decisions on whether to cooperate or not, while maximizing a
utility function that captures the cooperative gains, in terms of throughput
and delay.We show that the network can selforganize into a partition composed
of disjoint coalitions which constitutes the recursive core of the game
representing a key solution concept for coalition formation games in partition
form. Simulation results show that the proposed coalition formation algorithm
yields significant gains in terms of average rate per macrocell user, reaching
up to 239%, relative to the non-cooperative case. Moreover, the proposed
approach shows an improvement in terms of femtocell users' rate of up to 21%
when compared to the traditional closed access policy.

the relations between the dimension groups of the two systems. First, we
interpret the torsion subgroup of the quotient of the dimension groups
$K_0(X)/K_0(Y)$ in terms of intermediate extensions which are extensions of
$(Y,S)$ by a compact abelian group. Then we show that, by contrast, the
existence of an intermediate non-abelian finite group extension can produce a
situation where the dimension group of $(Y,S)$ embeds into a proper subgroup of
the dimension group of $(X,T)$, yet the quotient of the dimension groups is
nonetheless torsion free.
  Next we define higher order cohomology groups $H^n(X \mid Y)$ associated to
an extension, and study them in various cases (proximal extensions, extensions
by, not necessarily abelian, finite groups, etc.). Our main result here is that
all the cohomology groups $H^n(X \mid Y)$ are torsion groups. As a consequence
we can now identify $H^0(X \mid Y)$ as the torsion group of $ K_0(X)/K_0(Y)$.

electrically neutral and interact only weakly with ordinary matter; they thus
propagate through the Universe without absorption or deflection, pointing back
to their origin. Their feeble interaction, however, makes them extremely
difficult to detect. The years 2008-2010 have witnessed remarkable steps in
developing high energy neutrino telescopes. In 2010, the cubic-kilometre
neutrino telescope IceCube at the South Pole has been completed. In the
Mediterranean Sea the first-generation neutrino telescope ANTARES takes data
since 2008, and efforts are directed towards KM3NeT, a telescope on the scale
of several cubic kilometres. The next years will be key years for opening the
neutrino window to the high energy Universe. With an instrumented volume of a
cubic kilometre, IceCube is entering a region with realistic discovery
potential. Discoveries or non-discoveries of IceCube will have a strong impact
on the future of the field and possibly mark a ""moment of truth"". In this

it is the matter that drives the expansion's acceleration. So here we will not

Recovery Condition (ERC) is extended to a first exact recovery analysis of

guaranteed to exactly recover the unknown support in at most k iterations.
Moreover, we provide a closer look at the analysis of both OMP and OLS when the
ERC is not fulfilled. The existence of dictionaries for which some subsets are
never recovered by OMP is proved. This phenomenon also appears with basis
pursuit where support recovery depends on the sign patterns, but it does not
occur for OLS. Finally, numerical experiments show that none of the considered
algorithms is uniformly better than the other but for correlated dictionaries,
guaranteed exact recovery may be obtained after fewer iterations for OLS than

blind search of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The pulsars
were found with a novel hierarchical search method originally developed for
detecting continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars.
Designed to find isolated pulsars spinning at up to kHz frequencies, the new
method is computationally efficient, and incorporates several advances,
including a metric-based gridding of the search parameter space (frequency,
frequency derivative and sky location) and the use of photon probability
weights. The nine pulsars have spin frequencies between 3 and 12 Hz, and
characteristic ages ranging from 17 kyr to 3 Myr. Two of them, PSRs J1803-2149
and J2111+4606, are young and energetic Galactic-plane pulsars (spin-down power
above 6e35 erg/s and ages below 100 kyr). The seven remaining pulsars, PSRs
J0106+4855, J0622+3749, J1620-4927, J1746-3239, J2028+3332, J2030+4415,
J2139+4716, are older and less energetic; two of them are located at higher
Galactic latitudes (|b| > 10 deg). PSR J0106+4855 has the largest
characteristic age (3 Myr) and the smallest surface magnetic field (2e11 G) of
all LAT blind-search pulsars. PSR J2139+4716 has the lowest spin-down power
(3e33 erg/s) among all non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars ever found. Despite
extensive multi-frequency observations, only PSR J0106+4855 has detectable
pulsations in the radio band. The other eight pulsars belong to the increasing
population of radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars.

which can solve the hierarchy problem in the same way as the so-called Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and presents solutions to some of its
problems. Supersymmetry is broken in a secluded sector and mediated to the
observable sector by messengers of a gauge group G under which the first two
generations transform. The group G spontaneously breaks (almost)
supersymmetrically at a scale at most a few orders of magnitude below the scale
of gauge messengers M_*\sim 10^{15} GeV. By gauge mediation sfermions of the
first two generations acquire supersymmetry breaking masses \hat m \sim 10 TeV.
Supersymmetry breaking is also mediated by gravity which generates masses for
all sfermions, Higgsinos and gauginos at the TeV scale and can provide
appropriate values to the \mu and B_\mu parameters by D-term effective
operators. If gravity mediation is Minimal Flavor Violating there is no
supersymmetric flavor problem. In the presence of R-parity dark matter can be
the lightest neutralino, as in the MSSM, and the LHC model phenomenology is
characterized by the fact that only third generation squarks and sleptons are

spherical holes is calculated by matching exactly for the infinite set of
Wilson coefficients in an effective world line theory and then performing the
ensuing Gaussian integration. The partition is then re-calculated using
conformal field theory techniques, and the equality of the two results is made
manifest. It is then demonstrated that there is an exact correspondence between
the Wilson coefficients (susceptabilities) in the effective field theory and
the weights of the individual excitations of the closed string coherent state
on the boundary. We calculate the partition function for the case of three
holes where CFT techniques necessitate a closed form for the map from the
corresponding closed string pants diagrams. Finally, it is shown that the
Wilson coefficients for the case of quartic and higher order kernels, where
standard CFT techniques are no longer applicable, can also be completely

This implies that radiation plays an important role for the heat transport in
porous materials. Furthermore, the influence of this new model on the Hertz

of cometary activity are discussed. Finally, the limitations of this new model

initially ordered and coupled at the boundary to a heat reservoir. The adoption
of a proper microcanonical dynamics allows a detailed study of the time
evolution of the system. As expected, thermal propagation displays a diffusive
character and the spatial correlations decay exponentially in the direction
orthogonal to the heat flow. However, we show that the approach to equilibrium
presents an unexpected slow behavior. In particular, when the thermostat is at
infinite temperature, correlations decay to their asymptotic values by a power
law. This can be rephrased in terms of a correlation length vanishing
logarithmically with time. At finite temperature, the approach to equilibrium
is also a power law, but the exponents depend on the temperature in a
non-trivial way. This complex behavior could be explained in terms of two
dynamical regimes characterizing finite and infinite temperatures,
respectively. When finite sizes are considered, we evidence the emergence of a
much more rapid equilibration, and this confirms that the microcanonical
dynamics can be successfully applied on finite structures. Indeed, the slowness
exhibited by correlations in approaching the asymptotic values are expected to
be related to the presence of an unsteady heat flow in an infinite system.

surface gravity that was derived by radial-velocity and light-curve analysis
that could not be explained.
  Since then, emission lines of the secondary were identified in optical
spectra and its orbital-velocity amplitude was measured. Thus, the masses of
both components are known, however, within relatively large error ranges. The
secondary's mass was found to be around the stellar hydrogen-burning mass limit
and, thus, it may be a brown dwarf or a late M-type dwarf. In addition, a
precise determination of the primary's rotational velocity showed recently,
that it rotates at about 65% of bound rotation - much slower than previously
assumed.
  A new spectral analysis by means of metal-line blanketed, state-of-the-art,

result for the surface gravity is, within the error limits, in agreement with

provide evidence of a mismatch between the local (short-range) and the average

systems, chooses a signal with a noise-like character and much higher bandwidth
than necessary. This paper advocates spread spectrum modulation for
interstellar communication, motivated by robust immunity to radio-frequency
interference (RFI) of technological origin in the vicinity of the receiver
while preserving full detection sensitivity in the presence of natural sources
of noise. Receiver design for noise immunity alone provides no basis for
choosing a signal with any specific character, therefore failing to reduce
ambiguity. By adding RFI to noise immunity as a design objective, the
conjunction of choice of signal (by the transmitter) together with optimum
detection for noise immunity (in the receiver) leads through simple
probabilistic argument to the conclusion that the signal should possess the
statistical properties of a burst of white noise, and also have a large
time-bandwidth product. Thus spread spectrum also provides an implicit
coordination between transmitter and receiver by reducing the ambiguity as to
the signal character. This strategy requires the receiver to guess the specific
noise-like signal, and it is contended that this is feasible if an appropriate
pseudorandom signal is generated algorithmically. For example, conceptually
simple algorithms like the binary expansion of common irrational numbers like
Pi are shown to be suitable. Due to its deliberately wider bandwidth, spread
spectrum is more susceptible to dispersion and distortion in propagation
through the interstellar medium, desirably reducing ambiguity in parameters
like bandwidth and carrier frequency. This suggests a promising new direction
in interstellar communication using spread spectrum modulation techniques.

termination shock (91-113 AU). The correlation coefficient between the
intensities the Earth and V1 during this time period, is 0.936, allowing for a
~0.9 year delay due to the solar wind propagation time from the Earth to the
outer heliosphere. To describe these intensity changes and to predict the
absolute intensities measured at all three locations we have used a simple
spherically symmetric (no drift) two-zone heliospheric transport model with
specific values for the diffusion coefficient in both the inner and outer
zones. The diffusion coefficient in the outer zone, from about 90 to 120 (130)
AU, is determined to be ~5-10 times smaller than that in the inner zone out to
90 AU. This means that the outer zone acts much like a diffusing barrier in
this model. The absolute magnitude of the intensities and the intensity changes
at V1 and the Earth are described to within a few percent by a diffusion
coefficient that varies with time by a factor ~4 in the inner zone and only
~1.8 (1.25) in the outer zone over the time period from 2004-2010. These
diffusion coefficients and their variations are essentially the same as those
derived earlier from a similar study using He nuclei of the same energy. This
model and the diffusion coefficients used provide a total modulation potential
at the Earth ~250 MV in 2009. The difference ~10-20% between calculated and
observed intensities at V2 can be explained if the heliosphere is squashed by
~10% in distance (non-spherical) so that the HTS is closer to the Sun in the
