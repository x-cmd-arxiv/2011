holographic approach, we study baryon properties using Skyrmions generated from
holographic instantons. First we employ Atiyah and Manton's early observation
to show that the instanton approximation gives the correct infrared behavior
for the Skyrmion solution, and thus those of the electromagnetic form factors
of the nucleon. We then use Skyrmions generated from flat-space instanton
solutions to study various baryon properties, treating the instanton size as an
arbitrary variable. It is found that, a large instanton size is required to
reproduce the physical axial coupling. From such an instanton configuration,
the predictions for other baryon quantities in the Skyrme model improve the
original results quite a lot. Some of the results reproduce those by quantizing
the full instanton solution, while no fine-tuning of the mesonic parameters are
needed. From these we conclude that the baryons in the low energy region can be
effectively described by large instantons.

ongoing ram pressure stripping in multiple wavelengths: at the leading edge of
the interaction, the Halpha and dust extinction curve sharply out of the disk;
on the trailing side, a long Halpha/UV tail has been found which is located
upwind of a long HI tail. We complete the multiwavelength study with IRAM 30m
HERA CO(2-1) and VLA 6 cm radio continuum observations of NGC 4330. The data
are interpreted with the help of a dynamical model including ram pressure and,
for the first time, star formation. Our best-fit model reproduces qualitatively
the observed projected position, radial velocity of the galaxy, the molecular
and atomic gas distribution and velocity field, and the UV distribution in the
region where a gas tail is present. However, the observed red UV color on the
windward side is currently not reproduced by the model. Based on our model, the
galaxy moves to the north and still approaches the cluster center with the
closest approach occurring in ~100 Myr. In contrast to other Virgo spiral
galaxies affected by ram pressure stripping, NGC 4330 does not show an
asymmetric ridge of polarized radio continuum emission. We suggest that this is
due to the relatively slow compression of the ISM and the particular projection
of NGC 4330. The observed offset between the HI and UV tails is well reproduced
by our model. Since collapsing and starforming gas clouds decouple from the ram
pressure wind, the UV-emitting young stars have the angular momentum of the gas
at the time of their creation. On the other hand, the gas is constantly pushed
by ram pressure. The reaction (phase change, star formation) of the multiphase
ISM (molecular, atomic, ionized) to ram pressure is discussed in the framework
of our dynamical model.

optically-thick CSM by invoking an approximation for the effects of radiative
diffusion. In the context of this model, we provide predictions for the time of
forward shock break-out from the optically-thick part of the CSM envelope. We
also introduce a hybrid LC model that incorporates ejecta-CSM interaction plus
Ni-56 and Co-56 radioactive decay input. We fit this hybrid model to the LC of
the Super-Luminous Supernova (SLSN) 2006gy. We find that this model provides a
better fit to the LC of this event than previously presented models. We also
address the relation between Type IIL and Type IIn SN with ejecta-CSM
interaction models. Forward and reverse shock power input due to CSM
interaction can produce the LCs of Type IIn SNe in terms of duration, shape and
decline rate. This model can also produce LCs that are symmetric in shape
around peak luminosity. We conclude that the observed LC variety of SNe Type
IIn and of the SLSNe is likely to be a byproduct of the large range of

measurement of eta meson decay using WASA-at-COSY detector which tests
predictions of the Standard Model. The aim of this thesis is to estimate the
time of measurement for which the current branching ratio limit of eta -> 4pi0
decay can be improved. In order to estimate the time of measurement Monte Carlo
simulations were performed. Kinematics of the pp -> ppeta -> pp4pi0 -> pp8gamma
reactions were simulated using PLUTO program. Next, by means of the GEANT3
program the response of the WASA-at-COSY detector was simulated for each
particle. Received signals were analysed in RootSorter software package based
on ROOT. Studies of the reaction with many gamma quanta in the exit channel
required the investigation of WASA-at-COSY calorimeter functioning. Tests of a
cluster building algorithm with emphasis on merging and splitting of detected
signals were done. The obtained result shows that only about 3% of eta -> 4p0
decays can be properly reconstructed. The identification of the eta -> 4pi0 ->
8gamma decay was based on the invariant mass method for both pi0 and eta
mesons. As a result, the resolution of the invariant mass determination of the
eta meson was established to sigma = 31 MeV/c2. The acceptance of the
WASA-at-COSY detector for pp -> ppeta -> pp4pi0 -> pp8gamma reaction was
determined to Aeta=(Neta detected) / (Neta produced) = 1.5%. The time of
measurement for obtaining a statistical precision equal to the current
branching ratio limit for Tbeam = 1.3 GeV is about 13 hours. It was also
established that the lower the excess energy in the eta production is the
shorter the time of the measurement needed.

and redshift (z) has long been used as a method for locating high-z radio
galaxies. We use 9 highly spectroscopically complete radio samples, selected at
different frequencies and flux limits, to determine the efficiency of this
method, and compare consistently observed correlations between alpha,
luminosity, linear size, and redshift. We observe a weak correlation between z
and alpha which remains even when Malmquist bias is removed. The strength of
this correlation depends on both the k-correction and sample selection
frequency, in addition to the frequency at which alpha is measured, and
consistent results for both high and low frequency selected samples are only
seen if analysis is restricted to just extended radio galaxies. Many of the
highest redshift radio galaxies are very compact and often display a negatively
curved or peaked spectrum, and therefore the low-frequency radio spectrum as a
whole should be studied; this is something for which the LOFAR will be crucial.
We quantify both the efficiency and the completeness of various techniques used
to select high-z radio galaxies. A steep-spectrum cut applied to low-frequency
selected samples can more than double the fraction of high-z sources, but at a
cost of excluding over half of the high-z sources present in the original
sample. An angular size cut is an almost as equally effective method as a
steep-spectrum cut, and works for both high and low frequency selected samples.
In multi-wavelength data, selection first of infrared-faint radio sources
remains by far the most efficient method of selecting high-z sources. We
present a simple method for selecting high-z radio galaxies, based purely on
combining their radio properties of alpha and angular size, with the addition
of the K-band magnitude if available.[abridged]

especially a high dependence of the photon absorption on the relative
orientation and geometry of the nanotube-nanofiber setup in the optical and
near infrared domain. In particular, we calculate photon absorption
probabilities for a straight nanotube and nanofiber depending on their relative
angle. Nanotubes orthogonal to the fiber are found to perform much better than
parallel nanotubes when they are short. As the nanotube gets longer the
absorption of parallel nanotubes is found to exceed the orthogonal nanotubes
and approach 100% for extremely long nanotubes. In addition, we show that if
the nanotube is wrapped around the fiber in an appropriate way the absorption
is enhanced. We find that optical and near infrared photons could be converted
to excitations with efficiencies that may exceed 90%. This may provide
opportunities for future photodetectors and we discuss possible setups.

I$, where $\rho$ is a density matrix, $c_{\rho}$ is a non-negative number
related to $\rho$, and $I$ is the identity matrix. The general form of
entanglement witnesses is deduced from Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, that
can be reinterpreted as that all quantum states can be obtained by a maximally
quantum entangled state pass through certain completely positive maps.
Furthermore, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition of the
entanglement witness $W=\rho-c_{\rho}I$ in operation, as well as in theory.

Fixed antennas allow continuous contact with the Earth, solving the problem of

a simple caging design based on the DISCOS 1972 drag-free mission, an all

novel Bayesian inference framework for testing the strong-field dynamics of
General Relativity using coalescing compact binaries was proposed. Unlike
methods that were used previously, our technique addresses the question whether
one or more 'testing coefficients' (e.g. in the phase) parameterizing
deviations from GR are non-zero, rather than all of them differing from zero at
the same time. The framework is well-adapted to a scenario where most sources
have low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from multiple sources as seen
in multiple detectors can readily be combined. In our previous work, we
conjectured that this framework can detect generic deviations from GR that can
in principle not be accomodated by our model waveforms, on condition that the
change in phase near frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive is
comparable to that induced by simple shifts in the lower-order phase
coefficients of more than a few percent ($\sim 5$ radians at 150 Hz). To
further support this claim, we perform additional numerical experiments in
Gaussian and stationary noise according to the expected Advanced LIGO/Virgo
noise curves, and coherently injecting signals into the network whose phasing
differs structurally from the predictions of GR, but with the magnitude of the
deviation still being small. We find that even then, a violation of GR can be
established with good confidence.

unpaired fermionic degrees of freedom that cause sign problems and collect them

problems. A resummation of all unpaired fermion degrees of freedom inside the
bag is sufficient to solve the fermion sign problem in a variety of interesting
cases. Using a concept of duality we then argue that the size of the fermion
bags is small both at strong and weak couplings. This allows us to construct

  The invisible axion is a hypothetical elementary particle and a cold dark
matter candidate. I present an improved computation of the constraints on the
parameter space of the cold dark matter axion in the standard cosmology, that
includes the contributions from anharmonicities in the axion potential and from
the decay of axionic strings. In this scenario, I update the value of the mass
of the cold dark matter axion, finding the value $(67\pm17){\rm \mu eV}$,
approximately one order of magnitude larger than previous computations.
  The effect of nonstandard cosmological scenarios on the parameter space of
axion cold dark matter is studied for the first time. In particular, I consider
the cases of low-temperature reheating and kination cosmologies, and I show
that the mass of the cold dark matter axion can differ from the value in the
standard cosmological scenario by orders of magnitude.
  Finally, I consider the family of axion-like particles, assuming that these
particles serve as the inflaton in the context of warm inflation. I find that
the axion energy scale $f$, which in the standard inflation scenario is of the
order of the Planck mass, can be lowered to the much safer Grand Unification
Theory scale $f \sim 10^{16}{\rm GeV}$. I also constrain the parameter space
and the amount of gravitational waves from this model, using results from the

  of the paper is separated into a new paper; submitted",,,,"math.GT math.AT math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental group of the complement of a hyperplane arrangement plays an
important role in studying the corresponding arrangements. In particular, for
large families of hyperplane arrangements, this fundamental group, being
isomorphic to the fundamental group of a complement of a line arrangement, has
some remarkable properties: either it is a direct sum of free groups and a free
abelian group, or it has a conjugation-free geometric presentation.
  In this paper, we first give a complete proof to the following key lemma: if
we draw a new line through only one intersection point of a given real line
arrangement whose fundamental group is conjugation-free, then the fundamental
group of the new arrangement is also conjugation-free.
  Second, we generalize this lemma to the case of conic-line arrangements.
Moreover, we prove that once the graph associated to conic-line arrangements
(defined slightly different than the corresponding graph for line arrangements)
has no cycles, then the fundamental group of its complement has a
conjugation-free geometric presentation and in addition can be written as a
direct sum of free groups and a free abelian group. Also, we show that if the
graph consists of one cycle, and the conic does not pass through all the
multiple points corresponding to the vertices of the cycle, then the
fundamental group has a conjugation-free geometric presentation as well.
  For conclusion, we extend the family of real line arrangements having a
conjugation-free geometric presentation (for their fundamental group) by
defining the notion of a conjugation-free graph. We also extend this notion to
certain families of conic-line arrangements.

Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solver, capable of using very large timesteps without loss
of numerical stability or accuracy. A fundamental feature of the method is the
segregation of particle-orbit computations from the field solver, while
remaining fully self-consistent. This paper describes a very efficient,
mixed-precision hybrid CPU-GPU implementation of the implicit PIC algorithm
exploiting this feature. The JFNK solver is kept on the CPU in double precision
(DP), while the implicit, charge-conserving, and adaptive particle mover is
implemented on a GPU (graphics processing unit) using CUDA in single-precision
(SP). Performance-oriented optimizations are introduced with the aid of the
roofline model. The implicit particle mover algorithm is shown to achieve up to
400 GOp/s on a Nvidia GeForce GTX580. This corresponds to 25% absolute GPU
efficiency against the peak theoretical performance, and is about 300 times
faster than an equivalent serial CPU (Intel Xeon X5460) execution. For the test
case chosen, the mixed-precision hybrid CPU-GPU solver is shown to over-perform
the DP CPU-only serial version by a factor of \sim 100, without apparent loss

primarily determined by the figure of merit, zT. Rather than a fundamental
thermodynamic limit, this bound can be traced to the difficulty of maintaining
thermoelectric compatibility. Self-compatibility locally maximizes the cooler's
coefficient of performance for a given zT and can be achieved by adjusting the
relative ratio of the thermoelectric transport properties that make up zT. In
this study, we investigate the theoretical performance of thermoelectric
coolers that maintain self-compatibility across the device. We find such a
device behaves very differently from a Peltier cooler, and term self-compatible
coolers ""Thomson coolers"" when the Fourier heat divergence is dominated by the
Thomson, as opposed to the Joule, term. A Thomson cooler requires an
exponentially rising Seebeck coefficient with increasing temperature, while
traditional Peltier coolers, such as those used commercially, have
comparatively minimal change in Seebeck coefficient with temperature. When
reasonable material property bounds are placed on the thermoelectric leg, the
Thomson cooler is predicted to achieve approximately twice the maximum
temperature drop of a traditional Peltier cooler with equivalent figure of
merit (zT). We anticipate the development of Thomson coolers will ultimately
lead to solid state cooling to cryogenic temperatures.

the sum over quasinormal modes and their high-frequency asymptotics via a sum
rule. We derive the asymptotics of the quasinormal mode frequencies and their

provide the first X-ray broadband (0.5--60 keV) spectrum from which we confirm
a large intrinsic column density (nH = 1.6e23 /cm2), and we constrain the
cutoff energy for the first time (Ec = 19 keV). A prolonged (> 30 ks)
attenuation of the X-ray flux was observed which we tentatively attribute to an
eclipse of the probable neutron star by its massive companion, in a binary
system with an orbital period between 4 and 9 days, and inclination angles > 50
degrees. For IGR J17391-3021, we witnessed a transition from quiescence to a
low-activity phase punctuated by weak flares whose peak luminosities in the
0.5--10 keV band are only a factor of 5 times that of the pre-flare emission.
These micro flares are accompanied by an increase in nH which suggests the
accretion of obscuring clumps of wind. We now recognize that these low-activity
epochs constitute the most common emission phase for this system, and perhaps
in other supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) as well. We close with an

show very broad (v-b) lines with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of order
10^4 kms; at these times the blast wave was primarily interacting with the HII
region around the progenitor. Since then, the X-ray emission has been
increasingly dominated by narrower components as the blast wave encounters
dense equatorial ring (ER) material. Even so, continuing v-b emission is seen
in the grating spectra suggesting that interaction with HII region material is
on-going. Based on the deep HETG 2007 and 2011 data sets, and confirmed by RGS
and other HETG observations, the v-b component has a width of 9300 +/-2000 kms
FWHM and contributes of order 20% of the current 0.5--2 keV flux. Guided by
this result, SN 1987A's X-ray spectra are modeled as the weighted sum of the
non-equilibrium-ionization (NEI) emission from two simple 1D hydrodynamic
simulations, this ""2x1D"" model reproduces the observed radii, light curves, and
spectra with a minimum of free parameters. The interaction with the HII region
(rho_init \sim 130 amu/cc, +/- 15 degrees opening angle) produces the
very-broad emission lines and most of the 3-10 keV flux. Our ER hydrodynamics,
admittedly a crude approximation to the multi-D reality, gives ER densities of
order 10^4 amu/cc, requires dense clumps (x5.5 density enhancement in \sim 30%
of the volume), and it predicts that the 0.5-2 keV flux will drop at a rate of
\sim 17% per year once no new dense ER material is being shocked.

achieved via a coupling of this model with a simpler process in which the
internal dynamics has been replaced by a direct gradient sensing of the
chemoattractants concentrations. In the companion paper \cite{limits}, we have
rigorously shown, using a pathwise probabilistic technique, that both processes
converge towards the same advection-diffusion process in the diffusive
asymptotics. In this work, a direct coupling is achieved between paths of
individual bacteria simulated by both models, by using the same sets of random
numbers in both simulations. This coupling is used to construct a hybrid scheme
with reduced variance. We first compute a deterministic solution of the kinetic
density description of the direct gradient sensing model; the deviations due to
the presence of internal dynamics are then evaluated via the coupled
individual-based simulations. We show that the resulting variance reduction is

regions (age ranging from 100--500 Myr). Taking clues from dust/PAH, HI and CO
emission images we interpret NGC 3801 to have a kinamatically decoupled core or
an extremely warped gas disk. From the HST data we also show evidence of
ionised gas outflow similar to that observed in HI and molecular gas (CO) data,

colour of the galaxy. However, from these panchromatic data we interpret that
the expanding shock shells from the young ($\sim$2.4 million years) radio jets

this galaxy at a rare stage of its evolutionary sequence where post-merger star
formation has already declined and new powerful jet feedback is about to affect
the gaseous star forming outer disk within the next 10 Myr, to further

frontier which we address here with the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple
Species (BEAMS) algorithm and the full three years of data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey II Supernova Survey (SDSS-II SN). BEAMS is a Bayesian
framework for using data from multiple species in statistical inference when
one has the probability that each data point belongs to a given species,
corresponding in this context to different types of supernovae with their
probabilities derived from their multi-band lightcurves. We run the BEAMS
algorithm on both Gaussian and more realistic SNANA simulations with of order
10^4 supernovae, testing the algorithm against various pitfalls one might
expect in the new and somewhat uncharted territory of photometric supernova
cosmology. We compare the performance of BEAMS to that of both mock
spectroscopic surveys and photometric samples which have been cut using typical
selection criteria. The latter typically are either biased due to contamination
or have significantly larger contours in the cosmological parameters due to
small data-sets. We then apply BEAMS to the 792 SDSS-II photometric supernovae
with host spectroscopic redshifts. In this case, BEAMS reduces the area of the
(\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda) contours by a factor of three relative to the case
where only spectroscopically confirmed data are used (297 supernovae). In the
case of flatness, the constraints obtained on the matter density applying BEAMS
to the photometric SDSS-II data are \Omega_m(BEAMS)=0.194\pm0.07. This
illustrates the potential power of BEAMS for future large photometric supernova
surveys such as LSST.

based on diamond. Here, we report on the realization of such an integrated
diamond photonic platform, diamond on insulator (DOI), consisting of a thin
single crystal diamond film on top of an insulating silicon dioxide/silicon

operate in a wide wavelength range, including the visible (630nm) and

stringent bounds that approach the levels suggested by the Boron-8 solar data.
We next explore the possibility that the mediators of the NSI can be produced
at colliders. The constraints are found to be strongest for mediator masses in
the 10^2-10^3 GeV range, with the best bounds above ~ 200 GeV coming from ATLAS
and below from CDF. For mediators with masses below 30 GeV the monojet bounds
are weaker than in the contact limit. These results also directly apply to
light dark matter searches. Lastly, we discuss how neutrino NSI can be
distinguished from dark matter or Kaluza-Klein states with charged lepton
searches.

biological cells. Identifying the key controllers of such processes is
important for understanding the dynamical systems and planning further
analysis. Here we quantify the dynamical impact of a node as the probability of
damage spreading after switching the node's state. We find that the leading
eigenvector of the adjacency matrix is a good predictor of dynamical impact in
the case of long-term spreading. This so-called eigenvector centrality is also
a good proxy measure of the influence a node's initial state has on the
attractor the system eventually arrives at. Quality of prediction is further
improved when eigenvector centrality is based on the weighted matrix of
activities rather than the unweighted adjacency matrix. Simulations are
performed with ensembles of random Boolean networks and a Boolean model of
signaling in fibroblasts. The findings are supported by analytic arguments from
a linear approximation of damage spreading.

functions via the category of polynomial functors. In a prequel, we used
polynomial functors to categorify the Fock space representations of type A
affine Lie algebras. In the current work we continue the study of polynomial
functors from the point of view of higher representation theory. Firstly, we
categorify the Fock space representation of the Heisenberg algebra on the
category of polynomial functors. Secondly, we construct commuting actions of
the affine Lie algebra and the level p action of the Heisenberg algebra on the
derived category of polynomial functors over a field of characteristic p > 0,
thus weakly categorifying the Fock space representation of $\hat{gl}_p$.
Moreover, we study the relationship between these categorifications and
Schur-Weyl duality. The duality is formulated as a functor from the category of
polynomial functors to the category of linear species. The category of linear
species is known to carry actions of the Kac-Moody algebra and the Heisenberg
algebra. We prove that Schur-Weyl duality is a morphism of these
categorification structures.

convex hull of $n$ points chosen uniformly and independently from a convex
shape.
  (i) We show that the expected number of vertices of the convex hull of $n$
points, chosen uniformly and independently from a disk is $O(n^{1/3})$, and
$O(k \log{n})$ for the case a convex polygon with $k$ sides. Those results are
well known (see \cite{rs-udkhv-63,r-slcdn-70,ps-cgi-85}), but we believe that
the elementary proof given here are simpler and more intuitive.
  (ii) Let $\D$ be a set of directions in the plane, we define a generalized
notion of convexity induced by $\D$, which extends both rectilinear convexity
and standard convexity.
  We prove that the expected complexity of the $\D$-convex hull of a set of $n$
points, chosen uniformly and independently from a disk, is $O(n^{1/3} +
\sqrt{n\alpha(\D)})$, where $\alpha(\D)$ is the largest angle between two
consecutive vectors in $\D$. This result extends the known bounds for the cases
of rectilinear and standard convexity.
  (iii) Let $\B$ be an axis parallel hypercube in $\Re^d$. We prove that the
expected number of points on the boundary of the quadrant hull of a set $S$ of
$n$ points, chosen uniformly and independently from $\B$ is $O(\log^{d-1}n)$.
Quadrant hull of a set of points is an extension of rectilinear convexity to
higher dimensions. In particular, this number is larger than the number of
maxima in $S$, and is also larger than the number of points of $S$ that are
vertices of the convex hull of $S$.
  Those bounds are known \cite{bkst-anmsv-78}, but we believe the new proof is
simpler.

very massive black hole provides a unique opportunity to investigate the origin
of very high energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission generated in
relativistic outflows and the surroundings of super-massive black holes. M 87
has been established as a VHE gamma-ray emitter since 2006. The VHE gamma-ray
emission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In this
paper, results from a joint VHE monitoring campaign on M 87 by the MAGIC and
VERITAS instruments in 2010 are reported. During the campaign, a flare at VHE
was detected triggering further observations at VHE (H.E.S.S.), X-rays
(Chandra), and radio (43 GHz VLBA). The excellent sampling of the VHE gamma-ray
light curve enables one to derive a precise temporal characterization of the
flare: the single, isolated flare is well described by a two-sided exponential
function with significantly different flux rise and decay times. While the
overall variability pattern of the 2010 flare appears somewhat different from
that of previous VHE flares in 2005 and 2008, they share very similar
timescales (~day), peak fluxes (Phi(>0.35 TeV) ~= (1-3) x 10^-11 ph cm^-2
s^-1), and VHE spectra. 43 GHz VLBA radio observations of the inner jet regions
indicate no enhanced flux in 2010 in contrast to observations in 2008, where an
increase of the radio flux of the innermost core regions coincided with a VHE
flare. On the other hand, Chandra X-ray observations taken ~3 days after the
peak of the VHE gamma-ray emission reveal an enhanced flux from the core. The
long-term (2001-2010) multi-wavelength light curve of M 87, spanning from radio
to VHE and including data from HST, LT, VLA and EVN, is used to further
investigate the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission. No unique, common MWL
signature of the three VHE flares has been identified.

3 times. Two of these occasions can be associated with TeV flaring, and at the

rapidity of the intensity drop of the nucleus, we infer that the size of the

comparable to the same sort of estimate for the TeV emitting region. We also
find evidence of spectral evolution in the X-ray band which seems consistent

in the formation of a stable triaxial minimum in the energy surface of the IVBM

a perturbed $SU^{\ast}(3)$ dynamical symmetry, the theory is applied for the

relaxation time decreases monotonically with the electric field, which differs
from the two-dimensional case and is recognized due to to the cubic form of the
Dresselhauss spin-orbit coupling of the $\Gamma$ valley in bulk. In addition to
the direct modulation of the spin relaxation time, the electric field also
strongly influences the density and temperature dependences of the spin
relaxation. In contrast to the monotonic decrease with increasing lattice
temperature in the field-free condition, the spin relaxation time is shown to
decrease more slowly under the influence of the electric field and even to
increase monotonically in the case with small electron density and high
electric field. We even predict a peak in weakly doped samples under moderate
electric field due to the anomalous lattice-temperature dependence of the
hot-electron temperature. As for the $L$ valleys, we show that instead of
playing the role of a ""drain"" of the total spin polarization as in quantum well
systems, in bulk they serve as a ""momentum damping area"", which prevents
electrons from drifting to higher momentum states. This tends to suppress the

are transmitted from the deeper layers of the solar atmosphere and are
amplified in the corona, triggering nonlinear interactions. However trapping is
not perfect, some energy leaks down to the chromosphere, thus limiting the
turbulence development and the associated heating. We consider the combined
effects of turbulence and leakage in determining the energy level and
associated heating rate in models of coronal loops which include the
chromosphere and transition region. We use a piece-wise constant model for the
Alfven speed and a Reduced MHD - Shell model to describe the interplay between
turbulent dynamics in the direction perpendicular to the mean field and
propagation along the field. Turbulence is sustained by incoming fluctuations
which are equivalent, in the line-tied case, to forcing by the photospheric
shear flows. While varying the turbulence strength, we compare systematically
the average coronal energy level (E) and dissipation rate (D) in three models
with increasing complexity: the classical closed model, the semi-open corona
model, and the corona-chromosphere (or 3-layer) model, the latter two models
allowing energy leakage. We find that:
  (i) Leakage always plays a role (even for strong turbulence), E and D are
systematically lower than in the line-tied model. (ii) E is close to the

also introduce the representation of the above estimators in the harmonic

is shown to be almost entirely due to low multipoles, so it may have a
cosmological and even primordial origin. Contrary, the anti-symmetry one is
mainly due to intermediate multipoles that probably suggests its
non-fundamental nature. We have demonstrated that these anomalies are not

self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on percolation clusters. The length-distribution of
these SAWs encompasses to distinct averages, viz. the averages over cluster-
and SAW-conformations. For the latter average, there are two basic options, one
being static and one being kinetic. It is well known for static averaging that
if the disorder of the underlying medium is weak, differences to the ordered
case appear merely in non-universal quantities. Using dynamical field theory,
we show that the same holds true for kinetic averaging. For strong disorder,
i.e., the medium being close to the percolation point, we employ a field theory
for the nonlinear random resistor network in conjunction with a real-world
interpretation of Feynman diagrams, and we calculate the scaling exponents for
the shortest, the longest and the mean or average SAW to 2-loop order. In
addition, we calculate to 2-loop order the entire family of multifractal
exponents that governs the moments of the the statistical weights of the
elementary constituents (bonds or sites of the underlying fractal cluster)
contributing to the SAWs. Our RG analysis reveals that kinetic averaging leads
to renormalizability whereas static averaging does not, and hence, we argue
that the latter does not lead to a well-defined scaling limit. We discuss the
possible implications of this finding for experiments and numerical simulations
which have produced wide-spread results for the exponent of the average SAW. To
corroborate our results, we also study the well-known Meir-Harris model for
SAWs on percolation clusters. We demonstrate that this model leads back to
2-loop order to the renormalizable real world formulation with kinetic
averaging if the replica limit is consistently performed at the first possible
instant of the calculation.

'consistent quantum theory' that he has developed, the issue of whether, as is
often claimed, quantum mechanics entails a need for faster-than-light transfers
of information over long distances. He argues that the putative proofs of this
property that involve hidden variables include in their premises some
essentially classical-physics-type assumptions that are fundamentally
incompatible with the precepts of quantum physics. One cannot logically prove
properties of a system by establishing, instead, properties of a system
modified by adding properties alien to the original system. Hence Griffiths'
rejection of hidden-variable-based proofs is logically warranted. Griffiths
mentions the existence of a certain alternative proof that does not involve
hidden variables, and that uses only macroscopically described observable
properties. He notes that he had examined in his book proofs of this general
kind, and concluded that they provide no evidence for nonlocal influences. But
he did not examine the particular proof that he cites. An examination of that
particular proof by the method specified by his 'consistent quantum theory'
shows that the cited proof is valid within that restrictive version of quantum
theory. An added section responds to Griffiths' reply, which cites general
possibilities of ambiguities that make what is to be proved ill-defined, and
hence render the pertinent 'consistent framework' ill defined. But the vagaries
that he cites do not upset the proof in question, which, both by its physical
formulation and by explicit identification, specify the framework to be used.
Griffiths confirms the validity of the proof insofar as that framework is used.
The section also shows, in response to Griffiths' challenge, why a putative
proof of locality that he has described is flawed.

jets observed in star forming regions, but there has been some debate to how
they form. From a theoretical perspective, the consequences of disc and outflow
generation are crucial to understanding the very nature of how stars are
assembled. We have performed 3D ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of
collapsing Bonnor-Ebert spheres, employing sink particles with a radius of 3.2
AU alongside an AMR grid and using a cooling function to model radiative
cooling of the gas. This has allowed us to explore 2-8x10^4 yr further into the
evolution of an early Class 0 disc-outflow system than previous simulations.
Our outflow is precessing, kinked, turbulent, contains internal shocks and has
a scale of 0.1 pc end-to-end. We form a rotationally dominated disc with a
radius of 100 AU embedded inside a transient, unstable, flattened, rotating
core extending out to 2000 AU. The larger flattened structure launches a low
speed wind (v_r < 1.5 km/s) dominated by B_phi, while the inner disc launches a
centrifugally driven jet dominated by B_p with speeds up to 20$ km/s. From the
inner disk, the value of dM/dt_out/dM/dt_in ~ 0.1, wheras in the outer core
dM/dt_out/dM/dt_in ~ 1.0. The inner disc becomes unstable to a warping
instability due to the magnetic structure of the outflow and warps to 30 deg
with respect to the z-axis by the end of the simulation. The envelope is
cleared out and is less massive than the disc. We measure star formation
efficiencies of eta_core=0.63 (and growing), higher than theoretical
predictions. This indicates that outflows are not as efficient at expelling
envelope mass as some current models estimate. We discuss the relevance of our
disc misalignment concerning the formation of mis-aligned hot Jupiters.

quasars is set to increase by over an order of magnitude. These new discoveries
will enable a move from single-quasar studies to investigations of statistical
samples, presenting new opportunities to test theoretical models for the
structure of quasar accretion discs and broad emission line regions (BELRs). As
one crucial step in preparing for this influx of new lensed systems, a
large-scale exploration of microlensing convergence-shear parameter space is
warranted, requiring the computation of O(10^5) high resolution magnification
maps. Based on properties of known lensed quasars, and expectations from
accretion disc/BELR modelling, we identify regions of convergence-shear
parameter space, map sizes, smooth matter fractions, and pixel resolutions that
should be covered. We describe how the computationally time-consuming task of
producing ~290000 magnification maps with sufficient resolution (10000^2
pixel/map) to probe scales from the inner edge of the accretion disc to the
BELR can be achieved in ~400 days on a 100 teraflop/s high performance
computing facility, where the processing performance is achieved with graphics
processing units. We illustrate a use-case for the parameter survey by
investigating the effects of varying the lens macro-model on accretion disc
constraints in the lensed quasar Q2237+0305. We find that although all
constraints are consistent within their current error bars, models with more
densely packed microlenses tend to predict shallower accretion disc radial
temperature profiles. With a large parameter survey such as the one described
here, such systematics on microlensing measurements could be fully explored.

non-weighted and weighted directed complex networks. We introduce an efficient
method that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality
based on shortest paths of lengths not longer than $\ell = 1,...,L$ in case of
non-weighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities
based on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than $w_{\ell}=\ell
\Delta$, $\ell=1,2...,L=R/\Delta$. These measures provide a systematic
description on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its
network neighborhoods 1-step out, 2-steps out, etc. up to including the whole
network. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws
for large non-weighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality
measures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently
estimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the
traditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the
ranking top-list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities
quickly freezes as function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top-list
can be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest
node-to-node distance for a network of $N$ nodes, exploiting the aforementioned
scaling behavior. These observations are illustrated on model networks and on a
large social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs ($\sim 5.5\times 10^6$
nodes and $\sim 2.7\times 10^7$ edges). Finally, we apply these concepts to
efficiently detect the vulnerability backbone of a network (defined as the
smallest percolating cluster of the highest betweenness nodes and edges) and
illustrate the importance of weight-based centrality measures in weighted
networks in detecting such backbones.

is shown that it can be described exactly for arbitrary distribution of AF

analytically in this model. We consider continuous P(J) which is zero above

ferromagnetic phase emerges continuously in a field H > H_c = 2J_1. At 0 >

  The Method considers the borrower's income not simply as a known quantity at
the time the loan is made, but as an uncertain quantity following a statistical
distribution at some later point in the life of the loan. This allows a
probability to be associated with an income level leading to default, so that
the relative risk associated with different serviceability levels can be
quantified. In a sense, the Method can be thought of as an extension of the
Merton Model to quantities that fail to satisfy Merton's 'critical' assumptions
relating to the efficient markets hypothesis.

Using appropriate shifting of the order parameter in the Polyakov loop

10368 has been analyzed. It was observed by the Solar Broadband Radio
Spectrometer (SBRS/Huairou station, Beijing) in the 5.2-7.6 GHz range. It
proved to be only the third case of a neat zebra structure appearing among all
observations at such high frequencies. Despite the short duration of the burst
(25 s), it provided a wealth of data for studying the superfine structure with
millisecond resolution (5 ms). We localize the site of emission sources in the
flare region, estimate plasma parameters in the generation sites, and suggest
applicable mechanisms for interpretating spikes and zebra-structure generation.
Positions of radio bursts were obtained by the Siberian Solar Radio Telescope
(SSRT) (5.7 GHz) and Nobeyama radioheliograph (NoRH) (17 GHz). The sources in
intensity gravitated to tops of short loops at 17 GHz, and to long loops at 5.7
GHz. Short pulses at 17 GHz (with a temporal resolution of 100 ms) are
registered in the R-polarized source over the N-magnetic polarity
(extraordinary mode). Dynamic spectra show that all the emission comprised
millisecond pulses (spikes) of 5-10 ms duration in the instantaneous band of 70
to 100 MHz, forming the superfine structure of different bursts, essentially in
the form of fast or slow-drift fibers and various zebra-structure stripes. Five
scales of zebra structures have been singled out. As the main mechanism for
generating spikes (as the initial emission) we suggest the coalescence of
plasma waves with whistlers in the pulse regime of interaction between
whistlers and ion-sound waves. In this case one can explain the appearance of
fibers and sporadic zebra-structure stripes exhibiting the frequency splitting.

constraint of weak mixing angle by introducing localized brane kinetic terms in
higher dimensional GHU models with bulk and simple gauge groups. We find that
those terms lead to a ratio between Higgs and W boson masses, which is a little
bit deviated from the one derived in the standard model. From numerical
analysis, we find that the current lower bound on the Higgs mass tends to
prefer to exceptional groups E(6), E(7), E(8) rather than other groups like
SU(3l), SO(2n+1), G(2), and F(4) in 6-dimensional(D) GHU models irrespective of
the compactification scales. For the compactification scale below 1 TeV, the
Higgs masses in 6D GHU models with SU(3l), SO(2n+1), G(2), and F(4) groups are
predicted to be less than the current lower bound unless a model parameter
responsible for re-scaling SU(2) gauge coupling is taken to be unnaturally
large enough. To see how the situation is changed in more higher dimensional
GHU model, we take 7D S^{3}/ Z_{2} and 8D T^{4}/ Z_{2} models. It turns out
from our numerical analysis that these higher dimensional GHU models with gauge
groups except for E(6) can lead to the Higgs boson whose masses are predicted
to be above the current lower bound only for the compatification scale above 1
TeV without taking unnaturally large value of the model parameter, whereas the
Higgs masses in the GHU models with E(6) are compatible with the current lower
bound even for the compatification scale below 1 TeV.

growth of seed super-massive black-holes in galaxies at z>6. Specifically, we
find that the density at the centre of typical high redshift galaxies was at a
level where the Bondi accretion rate implies a diffusion speed of photons that
was slower than the gravitational infall velocity, resulting in photons being
trapped within the accretion flow and advected into the black-hole. We show
that there is a range of black-hole masses (M_bh ~ 10^3-10^5 solar masses)
where the accretion flow traps radiation, corresponding to black-holes that
were massive enough to generate a photon trapping accretion flow, but small
enough that their Bondi radii did not exceed the isothermal scale height of
self-gravitating gas. Under these conditions we find that the accretion reaches
levels far in excess of the Eddington rate. A prediction of this scenario is
that X-ray number counts of active galactic nuclei at z>6 would exhibit a
cutoff at the low luminosities corresponding to black-hole masses below ~10^5
solar masses. At low redshifts we find photon trapping to be unimportant
because it could only occur in rare low spin halos, and would require
black-hole masses in excess of expectations from the observed black-hole - halo
mass relation. The super-Eddington growth of ~10^5 solar mass seed black-holes
at high redshift may have provided a natural acceleration towards the growth of
super-massive black-holes at z~6-7, less than a billion years after the Big
Bang.

to be difficult if not impossible to find. We review some of the main tools for
(dis)proving decidability and apply them to problems in quantum information

prediction scores using high-dimensional data such as gene expression data for
clinical endpoints that are subject to censoring. In the presence of
well-established clinical risk factors, investigators often prefer a procedure
that also adjusts for these clinical variables. While accelerated failure time
(AFT) models are a useful tool for the analysis of censored outcome data, it
assumes that covariate effects on the logarithm of time-to-event are linear,
which is often unrealistic in practice. We propose to build risk prediction
scores through regularized rank estimation in partly linear AFT models, where
high-dimensional data such as gene expression data are modeled linearly and
important clinical variables are modeled nonlinearly using penalized regression
splines. We show through simulation studies that our model has better operating
characteristics compared to several existing models. In particular, we show
that there is a nonnegligible effect on prediction as well as feature selection
when nonlinear clinical effects are misspecified as linear. This work is
motivated by a recent prostate cancer study, where investigators collected gene
expression data along with established prognostic clinical variables and the
primary endpoint is time to prostate cancer recurrence.

simulations, we follow the dynamical formation of filaments and protostars
until a star formation efficiency of 20%. Despite the different initial
configurations, the global ensemble of all protostars in a setup shows a
similar energy evolution and forms sub-virial clusters with an energy ratio
$E_\mathrm{kin}/|E_\mathrm{pot}|\sim0.2$. Concentrating on the innermost
central region, the clusters show a roughly virialised energy balance. However,
the region of virial balance only covers the innermost $\sim10-30%$ of all the
protostars. In all simulations with multiple protostars, the total kinetic
energy of the protostars is higher than the kinetic energy of the gas cloud,
although the protostars only contain 20% of the total mass. The clusters vary
significantly in size, mass, and number of protostars, and show different
degrees of substructure and mass segregation. Flat density profiles and
compressive turbulent modes produce more subclusters then centrally
concentrated profiles and solenoidal turbulence. We find that dynamical
relaxation and hence dynamical mass segregation is very efficient in all cases

of energy transport at room temperature in Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic

harvesting complex to the reaction center (""sink"") is analyzed using an
effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We show that, as the coupling to the
reaction center is varied, maximal efficiency in energy transport is achieved
in the vicinity of the superradiance transition, characterized by a segregation
of the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the effective non-Hermitian

provides a quasi--continuum in the energy spectrum) is the dominant effect in
the energy transfer which takes place even in absence of a thermal bath. This
approach allows one to study the effects of finite temperature and the effects
of any coupling scheme to the reaction center. Moreover, taking into account a
realistic electric dipole interaction, we show that the optimal distance from
the reaction center to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson system occurs at the
superradiance transition, and we show that this is consistent with available

organisational complexity that social technologies are often hoped to cut
across is, in reality, something that shapes their uptake and use. We argue the
idea of a single, central social network site for supporting cooperative work

supporting organisations in managing what can best be referred to as a social

line with previous work, on three-dimensional off-lattice models, we show that
the liquid-vapor phase diagram exhibits a re-entrant or ""pinched"" shape for the
same range of \epsilon^\star_AB, suggesting that the ratio of the energy scales
- and the corresponding empty fluid regime - is independent of the
dimensionality of the system and of the lattice structure. In addition, the
model exhibits an order-disorder transition that is ferromagnetic in the
re-entrant regime. The use of low-dimensional lattice models allows the
simulation of sufficiently large systems to establish the nature of the
liquid-vapor critical points and to describe the structure of the liquid phase
in the empty fluid regime, where the size of the ""voids"" increases as the
temperature decreases. We have found that the liquid-vapor critical point is in
the 2D Ising universality class, with a scaling region that decreases rapidly
as the temperature decreases. The results of simulations and theoretical
analysis suggest that the line of order-disorder transitions intersects the
condensation line at a multicritical point at zero temperature and density, for
patchy particle models with a re-entrant, empty fluid, regime.

first suggested in 1977, in the light of modern understanding of the role of
Pop III stars and acceleration of particles in supernova shocks. We concentrate
on the production of cosmogenic UHE neutrinos in supernova explosions that
accompany the death of Pop III stars. Accelerated protons produce neutrinos in
collisions with CMB photons. We deliberately use simplified assumptions which
make our results transparent. Pop III stars are assumed to be responsible for
the reionization of the universe as observed by WMAP. Since the evolution of
Pop III stars is much faster than the Hubble rate, we consider the burst of UHE
proton production to occur at fixed redshift (z_b=10-20). We discuss the
formation of collisionless shocks and particle acceleration in the early
universe. The composition of accelerated particles is expected to be proton
dominated. A simple calculation is presented to illustrate the fact that the
diffuse neutrinos flux from the bright phase burst is concentrated in a
relatively narrow range around $7.5 \times 10^{15}(20/z_b)^2$ eV. The $\nu_\mu$
flux may be detectable by IceCube without violating the cascade upper limit and
the expected energetics of SNe associated with Pop III stars. A possible
signature of the neutrino production from Pop III stars may be the detection of
resonant neutrino events. For the burst at $z_b=20$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$-flux at
the cascade upper limit, the number of resonant events in IceCube may be as
high as 10 events in 5 years of observations. These events have equal energies,
$E=6.3\times 10^{15}$ eV, in the form of e-m cascades. Given the large
uncertainties in the existing predictions of UHE cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we
argue that neutrinos from the first stars might become one of the most reliable
hopes for UHE neutrino astronomy.

Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere instrument at the Dunn Solar
Telescope, to reveal how the generation of transverse waves in Type I spicules

Here we show how pressure oscillations, with periodicities in the range 130 -
440 s, manifest in small-scale photospheric magnetic bright points, and
generate kink waves in the Sun's outer atmosphere with transverse velocities
approaching the local sound speed. Through comparison of our observations with
advanced two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, we provide evidence
for how magnetoacoustic oscillations, generated at the solar surface, funnel
upwards along Type I spicule structures, before undergoing
longitudinal-to-transverse mode conversion into waves at twice the initial
driving frequency. The resulting kink modes are visible in chromospheric
plasma, with periodicities of 65 -220 s, and amplitudes often exceeding 400 km.
A sausage mode oscillation also arises as a consequence of the photospheric
driver, which is visible in both simulated and observational time series. We
conclude that the mode conversion and period modification is a direct
consequence of the 90 degree phase shift encompassing opposite sides of the
photospheric driver. The chromospheric energy flux of these waves are estimated
to be approximately 300,000 W/m^2, which indicates that they are sufficiently
energetic to accelerate the solar wind and heat the localized corona to its
multi-million degree temperatures.

possibility, since a double source is inferred at this wavelength. IRS 3 shows
a clear jet-like morphology at 3.6 cm. Over a time-span of four years, we
observed changes in the morphology of this source that we interpret as due to
ejection of ionized material in a jet. The emission at 3 mm of IRS 3 is
angularly resolved, with a deconvolved size (FWHM) of ~120 AU, and seems to be
tracing a dusty circumstellar disk perpendicular to the radio jet. An

takes place on the atmospheric structure, the core entropy, and subsequently on
the cooling of the interior of the planet. We address in a consistent fashion
the coupling between the day and the night sides of a planet by means of model
atmosphere calculations with heat redistribution. We assume that strong
convection leads to the same entropy on the day and night sides and that
gravity is the same on both hemispheres. We argue that the core cooling rates
from the two hemispheres of a strongly irradiated planet may not be the same
and that the difference depends on several important parameters. If the
day-night heat redistribution is very efficient or if it takes place at the
large optical depth, then the day-side and the night-side cooling may be
comparable. However, if the day-night heat transport is not efficient or if it
takes place at a shallow optical depth then there can be a large difference
between the day- and the night-side cooling and the night side will cool more
efficiently. If stellar irradiation becomes stronger, e.g. owing to stellar
evolution or migration, cooling from both the day and the night sides is
reduced. Enhanced metallicity of the atmosphere would act as an added ""blanket""
and reduces both the day- and the night-side cooling. However, a stratosphere
on the planetary day side can enhance day-side cooling since its opacity acts
as a ""sunshade"" that screens the stellar irradiation. These effects may also
influence the well-known gravity darkening and bolometric albedo effects in
interacting binaries, especially for strongly irradiated cold components.

package \GL\ \citep{FHT2007a} is popular, fast, and allows one to efficiently
build a path of models for different values of the tuning parameter.
Convergence of \GL\ can be tricky; the converged precision matrix might not be
the inverse of the estimated covariance, and occasionally it fails to converge
with warm starts. In this paper we explain this behavior, and propose new
algorithms that appear to outperform \GL.
  By studying the ""normal equations"" we see that, \GL\ is solving the {\em

a result which can also be found in \cite{BGA2008}.
  In this dual, the target of estimation is $\B\Sigma$, the covariance matrix,
rather than the precision matrix $\B\Theta$. We propose similar primal
algorithms \PGL\ and \DPGL, that also operate by block-coordinate descent,
where $\B\Theta$ is the optimization target. We study all of these algorithms,

model which exhibits the observed power laws and relates exponents to the
dimensionality of 2D space in which traffic networks are embedded. The model is
studied both analytically and in simulations and the conditions which result

self-organizing system, where the interactions among dynamical units form a
heterogeneous topology. Even if the dynamics of each microscopic unit is known,
a real understanding of their contributions to the macroscopic system behaviour
is still lacking. Here we develop information-theoretical methods to
distinguish the contribution of each individual unit to the collective
out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We show that for a system of units connected by a
network of interaction potentials with an arbitrary degree distribution, highly
connected units have less impact on the system dynamics as compared to
intermediately connected units. In an equilibrium setting, the hubs are often
found to dictate the long-term behaviour. However, we find both analytically
and experimentally that the instantaneous states of these units have a
short-lasting effect on the state trajectory of the entire system. We present
qualitative evidence of this phenomenon from empirical findings about a social
network of product recommendations, a protein-protein interaction network, and
a neural network, suggesting that it might indeed be a widespread property in
nature.

collaboration, they are still insufficiently taken into account in current
collaboration models and tools. In this paper, the concept of service protocols
is proposed as a model for human interactions supporting social requirements,
i.e., sets of constraints on the relations among interacting humans. Service
protocols have been proposed as an answer to the need for models for human
interactions in which not only the potential sequences of activities are
specified-as in process models-but also the constraints on the relations among
collaborators. Service protocols are based on two main ideas: first, service
protocols are rooted in the service-oriented architecture (SOA): each service
protocol contains a service-oriented summary which provides a representation of
the activities of an associated process model in SOA terms. Second, a
class-based graph-referred to as a service network schema-restricts the set of
potential service elements that may participate in the service protocol by
defining constraints on nodes and constraints on arcs, i.e., social
requirements. Another major contribution to the modelling of human interactions
is a unified approach organized around the concept of service, understood in a
broad sense with services being not only Web services, but also provided by
humans.

as a test for single site addressing. The effects we find can be attributed to
a dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms due to mutual exchange of

calculated by including collisional ionisation, stellar X-rays, cosmic rays and
the decay of radionuclides as ionisation sources, and by solving a simplified
chemical network which includes the effect of the absorption of free charges by

presence of evacuated cavities with radii ~2-8 AU, consistent with having been
carved by embedded giant planets. We found parameter values consistent with
those previously given in the literature, indicating a mild degree of grain
growth and dust settling, which deserves to be investigated with further

revisited. It is shown that the transition nature changes from critical to
sub-critical via a tri-critical point when frequency of vibration is increased
continuously. So (i) the transition is not hyper-critical as asserted
previously, but (ii) the fluctuations amplitude is spontaneously reinforced at
the tri-critical point compared to the one at other frequencies. So, (iii) this
analysis still contradicts a recent study which asserts that the bifurcation is
always critical, and that fluctuations shall depend on the number of grains
only. Beside, (iv) it is proposed a way to build an experiment, based on some
modification of the ""Maxwell's demon in granular gas"" set up, which undergoes a
hyper-critical bifurcation, with the use of some controlled feed-back of the
flows. This last idea can be generalised and used in other domains where
bifurcation theory applies, i.e. physics, chemistry, population dynamics,
economy, to improve regulation, but generating hyper- fluctuations. Finally it
is shown that the dynamical result is sensitive to the very-details of the
regulation.

carried out on the 4-m VISTA telescope in the ZYJHKs filters. In addition to
the multi-band imaging the variability monitoring campaign in the Ks filter has
started. Data reduction is carried out using the pipeline at the Cambridge
Astronomical Survey Unit. The photometric and astrometric calibration is
performed via the numerous 2MASS sources observed in each pointing. The first
data release contains the aperture photometry and astrometric catalogues for
348 individual pointings in the ZYJHKs filters taken in the 2010 observing
season. The typical image quality is ~0.9-1.0"". The stringent photometric and
image quality requirements of the survey are satisfied in 100% of the JHKs
images in the disk area and 90% of the JHKs images in the bulge area. The
completeness in the Z and Y images is 84% in the disk, and 40% in the bulge.
The first season catalogues contain 1.28x10^8 stellar sources in the bulge and
1.68x10^8 in the disk area detected in at least one of the photometric bands.
The combined, multi-band catalogues contain more than 1.63x10^8 stellar
sources. About 10% of these are double detections due to overlapping adjacent
pointings. These overlapping multiple detections are used to characterise the
quality of the data. The images in the JHKs bands extend typically ~4 mag
deeper than 2MASS. The magnitude limit and photometric quality depend strongly
on crowding in the inner Galactic regions. The astrometry for Ks=15-18 mag has
rms ~35-175 mas.

Transducers (OST) detect the heat transferred from a cavity's quench point via
""Second Sound"" through the superfluid He bath, needed to cool the
superconducting cavity. The observed response of an OST is a complex, but
reproducible pattern of oscillations. A small helium evaporation cryostat was
built which allows the investigation of the response of an OST in greater
detail. The distance between a point-like electrical heater and the OST can be
varied. The OST can be mounted either parallel or perpendicular to the plate,
housing the heat source. If the artificial quench-point releases an amount of
energy compatible to a real quench spot on a cavity's surface, the OST signal
starts with a negative pulse, which is usually strong enough to allow automatic
detection. Furthermore, the reflection of the Second Sound on the wall is
observed. A reflection coefficient R = 0.39 +- 0.05 of the glass wall is
measured. This excludes a strong influence of multiple reflections in the
complex OST response. Fourier analyses show three main frequencies, found in

We aim at
minimizing the energy consumption while enforcing two constraints: a prescribed
bound on the execution time (or makespan), and a reliability threshold. Dynamic
voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an approach frequently used to reduce
the energy consumption of a schedule, but slowing down the execution of a task
to save energy is decreasing the reliability of the execution. In this work, to
improve the reliability of a schedule while reducing the energy consumption, we
allow for the re-execution of some tasks. We assess the complexity of the
tri-criteria scheduling problem (makespan, reliability, energy) of deciding
which task to re-execute, and at which speed each execution of a task should be
done, with two different speed models: either processors can have arbitrary
speeds (continuous model), or a processor can run at a finite number of
different speeds and change its speed during a computation (VDD model). We
propose several novel tri-criteria scheduling heuristics under the continuous
speed model, and we evaluate them through a set of simulations. The two best
heuristics turn out to be very efficient and complementary.

(GNO), and Super-Kamiokande experiments, their statistical analyses were
performed to search for whether there existed a time variation of these fluxes.
The results of the analysis for the three experiments indicate that these
fluxes are varying quasi-biennially. This means that both efficiencies of the
initial p-p and the pp-III reactions of the proton-proton chain are varying
quasi-biennially together with a period of about 26 months. Since this time
variation prospectively generated by these two reactions strongly suggests that
the efficiency of the proton-proton chain as the main energy source of the Sun
has a tendency to vary quasi-biennially due to some chaotic or non-linear
process taking place inside the gravitationally stabilized solar fusion
reactor. It should be, however, remarked that, at the present moment, we have
no theoretical reasoning to resolve this mysterious result generally referred
to as the quasi-biennial periodicity in the time variation of the fluxes of
solar neutrinos. There is an urgent need to search for the reason why such a
quasi-biennial periodicity is caused through some physical process as related
to nuclear fusion deep inside the Sun.

obtained solutions of the Langevin Equations allow us to study the entanglement
generation between the oscillators in terms of the time evolution of the

findings, namely that significant entanglement between oscillators embedded in
a free bosonic bath can only be achieved if the system are within a microscopic
distance. We also consider the case where the bosonic spectral density is
substantially modified by imposing boundary conditions on the bath modes. For
boundary conditions corresponding to a wave-guide like geometry of the bath we
find significantly enlarged entanglement generation. This phenomenon is
additionally illustrated within an approximative model that allows for an

correlation is driven by the motion of objects or positioning of the vision
sensors. It concentrates on the problem where images are encoded with
compressed linear measurements. We propose a geometry-based correlation model
in order to describe the common information in pairs of images. We assume that
the constitutive components of natural images can be captured by visual
features that undergo local transformations (e.g., translation) in different
images. We first identify prominent visual features by computing a sparse
approximation of a reference image with a dictionary of geometric basis
functions. We then pose a regularized optimization problem to estimate the
corresponding features in correlated images given by quantized linear
measurements. The estimated features have to comply with the compressed
information and to represent consistent transformation between images. The
correlation model is given by the relative geometric transformations between
corresponding features. We then propose an efficient joint decoding algorithm
that estimates the compressed images such that they stay consistent with both
the quantized measurements and the correlation model. Experimental results show
that the proposed algorithm effectively estimates the correlation between
images in multi-view datasets. In addition, the proposed algorithm provides
effective decoding performance that compares advantageously to independent
coding solutions as well as state-of-the-art distributed coding schemes based
on disparity learning.

better understandings of obesity and eating disorders have been attracting
