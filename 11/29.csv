(L_kin) and well-characterized SEDs, we found (Meyer et al., 2011) that
Intermediate synchrotron-peaking (ISP) blazars may have lower gamma-ray output
than high synchrotron-peaking (HSP) blazars of similar L_kin, consistent with
our hypothesis that ISP blazars are less-beamed versions of HSP blazars, rather
than a distinct population. Further, by using the radio core dominance as a
measure of relative beaming, we find that gamma-ray luminosity depends on
beaming in a consistent way for blazars ranging over all jet kinetic powers
(10^42 - 10^46 ergs/s). We re-examine the gamma-ray properties of this core
sample of blazars using the 1-year LAT catalog (Abdo et al., 2010). We find
that for weak jets, the ratio of inverse Compton to synchrotron emission
remains constant with increased beaming, consistent with an SSC model for the
jet emission, while the most powerful jets show a strong increase in Compton
dominance with orientation, consistent with an external Compton (EC) emission
model.

produces a table which satisfies the marginal constraints. However, in general,
the interval may not be equal to the support of the marginal distribution. In
this case, the SIS procedure may produce tables which do not satisfy the
marginal constraints, leading to rejection Chen et al 2006. In this paper we
consider the uniform distribution as the target distribution. First we show
that if we fix the number of rows and columns of the design matrix of the model

We then show experimentally that in general the SIS procedure may have large
rejection rates even with small tables. Further we show that in general the
classical SIS procedure in Chen et al, 2005 can have a large rejection rate

study, we used the univariate and bivariate logistic regression models since

solved by a combinatorial randomized algorithm in time
$$\widetilde{O}(n^{2}\sqrt {n + \min\{MWT(A_G), MWT(A_G^t)\}})$$
  As a corollary, we conclude that the transitive closure of a directed graph
$G$ can be computed by a combinatorial randomized algorithm in the

discuss which definition of epsilon_n gives the best estimator of v_n. We find
that the common practice of using an r^2 weight in the definition of

r^n weight, for n > 2. We similarly study the importance of additional
properties of the initial state. For example, we show that in order to
correctly predict v_4 and v_5 for non-central collisions, one must take into

(epsilon_2)*(epsilon_3), respectively. We find that it makes no difference
whether one calculates the eccentricities over a range of rapidity, or in a

We verify the consistence of this framework by using it to develop some
twinlike self-dual Maxwell-Higgs models. We use a combination of theoretical
and numerical techniques to show that these models exhibit the very same
topological BPS structures, including their field configurations and total
energy. The study shows that it is possible to develop a completely consistent
prescription, which extends the idea of twinlike models to the case of vortices
in Maxwell-Higgs theories.

days. Mode frequencies are extracted from the observed Fourier spectrum of the
light curve. Numerical stellar models are then computed to determine the
characteristics of the star (mass, age, etc...) from the comparison with
observational constraints. We provide evidence for the presence of solar-like
oscillations at low frequency, between 10 and 20\,$\mu$Hz, with a regular
spacing of $(1.7\pm0.1)\mu$Hz between consecutive radial orders. Only radial
modes are clearly visible. From the models compatible with the observational
constraints used here, We find that HR\,2582 (HD\,50890) is a massive star with
a mass in the range (3--\,5\,$M_{\odot}$), clearly above the red clump. It
oscillates with rather low radial order ($n$ = 5\,--\,12) modes. Its
evolutionary stage cannot be determined with precision: the star could be on
the ascending red giant branch (hydrogen shell burning) with an age of
approximately 155 Myr or in a later phase (helium burning). In order to obtain
a reasonable helium amount, the metallicity of the star must be quite subsolar.
Our best models are obtained with a mixing length significantly smaller than
that obtained for the Sun with the same physical description (except
overshoot). The amount of core overshoot during the main-sequence phase is
found to be mild, of the order of 0.1\,$H_{\rm p}$.

spectral triple admits a twisted index pairing with unitaries satisfying a
modular condition. The twist means that the dimensions of kernels and cokernels
are measured with respect to two different but intimately related traces. The
twisted index pairing can be expressed by pairing Chern characters in reduced
versions of twisted cyclic theories. We end the paper by giving a local formula
for the reduced Chern character in the case of quantum SU(2). It appears as a
twisted coboundary of the Haar-state. In particular we present an explicit

energy-dependent and with amplitude increasing with energy. We demonstrate this
using time-dependent numerical simulations of blazar variability.

and Boltzmann Fock spaces that is a refinement of the $q$-Fock space of [BS91].
Starting with a real, separable Hilbert space $H$, we construct the
$(q,t)$-Fock space and the corresponding creation and annihilation operators,
$\{a_{q,t}(h)^\ast\}_{h\in H}$ and $\{a_{q,t}(h)\}_{h\in H}$, satifying the
$(q,t)$-commutation relation $a_{q,t}(f)a_{q,t}(g)^\ast-q \,a_{q,t}(g)^\ast
a_{q,t}(f)= <f,g>_{_H}\, t^{N},$ for $h,g\in H$, with $N$ denoting the number
operator. Interpreting the bounded linear operators on the $(q,t)$-Fock space
as non-commutative random variables, the analogue of the Gaussian random
variable is given by the deformed field operator
$s_{q,t}(h):=a_{q,t}(h)+a_{q,t}(h)^\ast$, for $h\in H$. The resulting
refinement is particularly natural, as the moments of $s_{q,t}(h)$ are encoded
by the joint statistics of crossings \emph{and nestings} in pair partitions.
Furthermore, the orthogonal polynomial sequence associated with the normalized
$(q,t)$-Gaussian $s_{q,t}$ is that of the $(q,t)$-Hermite orthogonal
polynomials, a deformation of the $q$-Hermite sequence that is given by the
recurrence $zH_n(z;q,t)=H_{n+1}(z;q,t)+[n]_{q,t}H_{n-1}(z;q,t),$ with
$H_0(z;q,t)=1$, $H_1(z;q,t)=z$, and $[n]_{q,t}=\sum_{i=1}^n q^{i-1}t^{n-i}$.
The $q=0<t$ specialization yields a new single-parameter deformation of the
full Boltzmann Fock space of free probability. The probability measure

polaron formation depends on features in the electronic structure near the

reveals that a hybrid functional approach is superior to GGA+U in correctly

  robustness and sensitivity",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key step in many perceptual decision tasks is the integration of sensory
inputs over time, but fundamental questions remain about how this is
accomplished in neural circuits. One possibility is to balance decay modes of
membranes and synapses with recurrent excitation. To allow integration over
long timescales, however, this balance must be precise; this is known as the
fine tuning problem. The need for fine tuning can be overcome via a
ratchet-like mechanism, in which momentary inputs must be above a preset limit
to be registered by the circuit. The degree of this ratcheting embodies a
tradeoff between sensitivity to the input stream and robustness against
parameter mistuning.
  The goal of our study is to analyze the consequences of this tradeoff for
decision making performance. For concreteness, we focus on the well-studied
random dot motion discrimination task. For stimulus parameters constrained by
experimental data, we find that loss of sensitivity to inputs has surprisingly
little cost for decision performance. This leads robust integrators to
performance gains when feedback becomes mistuned. Moreover, we find that
substantially robust and mistuned integrator models remain consistent with
chronometric and accuracy functions found in experiments. We explain our
findings via sequential analysis of the momentary and integrated signals, and
discuss their implication: robust integrators may be surprisingly well-suited
to subserve the basic function of evidence integration in many cognitive tasks.

  When $\Omega$ is the unit ball, we demonstrate that translates of
polyharmonic splines are fundamental by considering two related problems: the
fundamentality in the space of functions vanishing at the boundary and
fundamentality of the restricted kernel in the space of continuous function on
the sphere. This gives rise to a new approximation scheme composed of two

reconcile the OPERA claim of neutrino superluminality with other observational
constraints. The severity of the supernova bound and of the kinematical
constraints of Cohen-Glashow type lead us to focus on scenarios where all types
of particles are superluminal inside matter. In contrast to the Dvali-Vikman
proposal, this matter effect needs to be very short-ranged to avoid constraints
from experiments on the Earth's surface in low-density environments. Due to
this short range, the interaction underlying such a matter effect would have to
be far stronger than permitted by fifth-force bounds. As a conceivable way out
we suggest to make the matter effect ""binary"", i.e., dense matter does not
directly trigger superluminality, but merely induces the transition to a
different phase of some weakly coupled hidden sector. This phase exhibits
spontaneous Lorentz violation or at least a stronger than usual mediation of
some residual Lorentz violation to all matter. The effect has not been observed
before since we have never before been able to measure the velocity of
high-energy particles in dense matter with sufficient precision.

nonlocal interactions. The time required for thermalization to occur in such
models should reflect the relaxation times associated with classical black
holes in general relativity. Moreover, the time required for a particularly
strong form of thermalization to occur, sometimes known as scrambling,
determines the time scale on which black holes should start to release
information. It has been conjectured that black holes scramble in a time
logarithmic in their entropy, and that no system in nature can scramble faster.
In this article, we address the conjecture from two directions. First, we
exhibit two examples of systems that do indeed scramble in logarithmic time:
Brownian quantum circuits and the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a sparse
random graph. Unfortunately, both fail to be truly ideal fast scramblers for
reasons we discuss. Second, we use Lieb-Robinson techniques to prove a
logarithmic lower bound on the scrambling time of systems with finite norm
terms in their Hamiltonian. The bound holds in spite of any nonlocal structure
in the Hamiltonian, which might permit every degree of freedom to interact
directly with every other one.

  arXiv:1105.2053",,,"LBNL 5203E","quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The principle of sufficient reason asserts that anything that happens does so
for a reason: no definite state of affairs can come into being unless there is
a sufficient reason why that particular thing should happen. This principle is
usually attributed to Leibniz, although the first recorded Western philosopher
to use it was Anaximander of Miletus. The demand that nature be rational, in
the sense that it be compatible with the principle of sufficient reason,
conflicts with a basic feature of contemporary orthodox physical theory, namely
the notion that nature's response to the probing action of an observer is
determined by pure chance, and hence on the basis of absolutely no reason at
all. This appeal to pure chance can be deemed to have no rational fundamental
place in reason-based Western science. It is argued here, on the basis of the
other basic principles of quantum physics, that in a world that conforms to the
principle of sufficient reason, the usual quantum statistical rules will
naturally emerge at the pragmatic level, in cases where the reason behind
Nature's choice of response is unknown, but that the usual statistics can
become biased in an empirically manifest and apparently retrocausal way when
the reason for the choice is empirically identifiable. It is shown here that if
the statistical laws of quantum mechanics were to be biased in a certain
plausible way then the basically forward-in-time unfolding of empirical reality
described by orthodox quantum mechanics would generate the appearance of
backward-time-causation of the kind that have been reported in the scientific
literature.

to have different vertical scale heights, their thickness increasing with age.
Using SEGUE spectroscopic survey data, we have recently shown that
mono-abundance sub-populations, defined in the [\alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] space, are
well described by single exponential spatial-density profiles in both the
radial and the vertical direction; therefore any star of a given abundance is
clearly associated with a sub-population of scale height h_z. Here, we work out
how to determine the stellar surface-mass density contributions at the solar
radius R_0 of each such sub-population, accounting for the survey selection
function, and for the fraction of the stellar population mass that is reflected
in the spectroscopic target stars given populations of different abundances and
their presumed age distributions. Taken together, this enables us to derive
\Sigma_{R_0}(h_z), the surface-mass contributions of stellar populations with
scale height h_z. Surprisingly, we find no hint of a thin-thick disk
bi-modality in this mass-weighted scale-height distribution, but a smoothly
decreasing function, approximately \Sigma_{R_0}(h_z)\propto \exp(-h_z), from
h_z ~ 200 pc to h_z ~ 1 kpc. As h_z is ultimately the structurally defining
property of a thin or thick disk, this shows clearly that the Milky Way has a
continuous and monotonic distribution of disk thicknesses: there is no 'thick
disk' sensibly characterized as a distinct component. We discuss how our result
is consistent with evidence for seeming bi-modality in purely geometric disk
decompositions, or chemical abundances analyses. We constrain the total visible
stellar surface-mass density at the Solar radius to be \Sigma^*_{R_0} = 30 +/-
1 M_\odot pc^{-2}.

the literature. For both the LMC and the SMC the metallicity spread exceeds 1
dex in [Fe/H]. The distribution of metallicities in both Clouds is very
uniform, and no significant metallicity gradient is detectable. We also do not
find any pronounced populations of extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae candidates
with metallicities well below -2 dex, although we need to caution that the
photometric method used may overestimate the metallicities of metal-deficient
stars. Moreover, because of stellar evolutionary effects one does not expect to
observe many RR Lyrae stars among very metal-poor horizontal branch stars. We
suggest that the Magellanic Clouds experienced fairly rapid and efficient early
enrichment involving pre-enriched gas as well as possibly gas infall, while
metal loss through outflows does not seem to have played a significant role.
Moreover we suggest that the differences in the metallicities of the old
population of LMC and SMC make an origin from a single, common progenitor
unlikely, unless the separation happened very early on.

photometric-redshift estimates and combining 1- and 2-point statistics will
give marginal 1-sigma errors of Delta(sigma_8) ~ 0.036 and Delta(Omega_m) ~

the local, orthogonal and equilateral model, respectively. Measuring redshifts

highlight the existence of an intrinsic history bias which makes the nature
versus nurture (as well as the mass versus environment) debate inherently ill
posed. In particular we show that: (i) surviving massive satellites were
accreted later than their less massive counterparts, from more massive haloes;
(ii) the mixing of galaxy populations is incomplete during halo assembly, which
creates a correlation between the time a galaxy becomes satellite and its
present distance from the parent halo centre. The weakest trends are found for
the most massive satellites, as a result of efficient dynamical friction and
late formation times of massive haloes. A large fraction of the most massive
group/cluster members are accreted onto the main progenitor of the final halo
as central galaxies, while about half of the galaxies with low and intermediate
stellar mass are accreted as satellites. Large fractions of group and cluster
galaxies (in particular those of low stellar mass) have therefore been
`pre-processed' as satellites of groups with mass ~10^13 Msun. To quantify the
relevance of hierarchical structure growth on the observed environmental
trends, we have considered observational estimates of the passive galaxy
fractions, and their variation as a function of halo mass and cluster-centric
distance. Comparisons with our theoretical predictions require relatively long
times (~5-7 Gyr) for the suppression of star formation in group and cluster
satellites. [abridged]

stellar feedback on the formation and evolution of giant star-forming gas
'clumps' in high-redshift, gas-rich galaxies. Such galactic disks are unstable
to the formation of bound gas-rich clumps whose properties initially depend
only on global disk properties, not the microphysics of feedback. In
simulations without stellar feedback, clumps turn an order-unity fraction of
their mass into stars and sink to the center, forming a large bulge and kicking
most of the stars out into a much more extended stellar envelope. By contrast,
strong radiative stellar feedback disrupts even the most massive clumps after
they turn ~10-20% of their mass into stars, in a timescale of ~10-100 Myr,
ejecting some material into a super-wind and recycling the rest of the gas into
the diffuse ISM. This suppresses the bulge formation rate by direct 'clump
coalescence' by a factor of several. However, the galactic disks do undergo
significant internal evolution in the absence of mergers: clumps form and
disrupt continuously and torque gas to the galactic center. The resulting
evolution is qualitatively similar to bar/spiral evolution in simulations with
a more homogeneous ISM.

found that there is a potentially dominant effect on mildly non-linear scales
due to power in modes of size equal to and larger than the survey volume. This
{\it beat coupling} effect has been derived analytically in perturbation theory
and while it has been tested with simulations, some questions remain
unanswered. Moreover, there is an additional effect of these large modes, which
has so far not been included in analytic studies, namely the effect on the
estimated {\it average} density which enters the power spectrum estimate. In
this article, we work out analytic, perturbation theory based expressions
including both the beat coupling and this {\it local average effect} and we
show that while, when isolated, beat coupling indeed causes large excess
covariance in agreement with the literature, in a realistic scenario this is
compensated almost entirely by the local average effect, leaving only $\sim 10
%$ of the excess. We test our analytic expressions by comparison to a suite of
large N-body simulations. For the variances, we find excellent agreement with
the analytic expressions for $k < 0.2 h$Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0.5$, while the
correlation coefficients agree to beyond $k=0.4 h$Mpc$^{-1}$. As expected, the
range of agreement increases towards higher redshift and decreases slightly
towards $z=0$. We finish by including the large-mode effects in a full
covariance matrix description for arbitrary survey geometry and confirming its
validity using simulations. This may be useful as a stepping stone towards
building an actual galaxy (or other tracer's) power spectrum covariance matrix.

there has been a long-standing debate about the interpretation of the wave
function---the central object of the theory. Two prominent views are that (i)
it corresponds to an element of reality, i.e. an objective attribute that
exists before measurement, and (ii) it is a subjective state of knowledge about
some underlying reality. A recent result [Pusey et al. arXiv:1111.3328] has
placed the subjective interpretation into doubt, showing that it would
contradict certain physically plausible assumptions, in particular that
multiple systems can be prepared such that their elements of reality are
uncorrelated. Here we show, based only on the assumption that measurement
settings can be chosen freely, that a system's wave function is in one-to-one
correspondence with its elements of reality. This also eliminates the
possibility that it can be interpreted subjectively.

prevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another, limiting the
ability of studying galaxy clustering on all scales. We present a new method
for correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy clustering statistics
based on spectroscopic observations. Our method makes use of observations in
tile overlap regions to measure the contributions from the collided population,
and to therefore recover the full clustering statistics. The method is rooted
in solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs.
We demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the full
three-dimensional redshift-space two-point correlation functions on scales both
below and above the fiber collision scale, superior to the commonly used
nearest neighbor and angular correction methods. We discuss potential
systematic effects in our method. The statistical correction accuracy of our
method is only limited by sample variance, which scales down with (the square
root of) the volume probed. For a sample similar to the final SDSS-III BOSS
galaxy sample, the statistical correction error is expected to be at the level
of 1% on scales 0.1--30Mpc/h for the two-point correlation functions. The
systematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by non-perfect correction
of collision multiplets, and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5%.
Our correction method, which can be generalized to other clustering statistics
as well, enables more accurate measurements of full three-dimensional galaxy
clustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys. (abridged)

CMB by contributing to the radiation density, which alters the expansion rate
of the universe during the epoch leading up to recombination. In this paper, we
consider an alternative possibility that the excess kinetic energy implied by
these measurements was possessed by dark matter particles that were produced
through a non-thermal mechanism, such as late-time decays. In particular, we
find that if a small fraction (<1%) of the dark matter in the universe today
were produced through the decays of a heavy and relatively long-lived state,
the expansion history of the universe can be indistinguishable from that
predicted in the standard cosmological model with an additional neutrino.
Furthermore, if these decays take place after the completion of big bang
nucleosynthesis, this scenario can avoid tension with the value of three
neutrino species preferred by measurements of the light element abundances.

continuum luminosity at 5100A (L_5100). From the distribution of the ""virial

SE spectra, we estimate the uncertainty due to the combined variability as ~
0.05 dex (12%). This is subdominant with respect to the total uncertainty in SE
mass estimates, which is dominated by uncertainties in the size-luminosity
relation and virial coefficient, and is estimated to be ~ 0.46 dex (factor of ~
3). By comparing the Hbeta line profile of the SE, mean, and root-mean-square
(rms) spectra, we find that the Hbeta line is broader in the mean (and SE)
spectra than in the rms spectra by ~ 0.1 dex (25%) for our sample with
FWHM_Hbeta < 3000 km/s. This result is at variance with larger mass black holes
where the difference is typically found to be much less than 0.1 dex. To
correct for this systematic difference of the Hbeta line profile, we introduce

half-light radii ($\sim 60-90$ pc) but a wide range of ellipticities. Both Leo
V and CVn II show hints of stream-like overdensities at large radii. An
analysis of the satellite color-magnitude diagrams shows that all three objects
are old ($>$ 10 Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\sim -2$), though neither the
models nor the data have sufficient precision to assess when the satellites
formed with respect to cosmic reionization. The lack of an observed younger
stellar population ($\la 10$ Gyr) possibly sets them apart from the other
satellites at Galactocentric distances $\ga 150$ kpc. We present a new
compilation of structural data for all Milky Way satellite galaxies and use it

ellipticity distribution of the two groups is consistent at the

stellar mass function on galactic and subgalactic scales. This difference is
usually reconciled by assuming that the galaxy formation efficiency drops
sharply with decreasing halo mass, so that virtually no dwarf galaxies form in
halos less massive than ~ 10^10 M_sun. In turn, this implies that, at any given
radius, the dark mass enclosed by a galaxy must exceed a certain minimum. We
use rotation curves of dwarf galaxies compiled from the literature to explore
whether their enclosed mass is consistent with these constraints. We find that
almost one half of the dwarfs in our sample with stellar mass between 10^6-10^7
M_sun are at odds with this restriction: either they live in halos with masses
substantially below 10^10 M_sun or there is a mechanism capable of reducing the
dark mass enclosed by some of the faintest dwarfs. Neither possibility is
easily accommodated within the standard LCDM scenario. Extending galaxy
formation to halos well below 10^10 M_sun would lead to large numbers of dwarf
galaxies in excess of current estimates; at the same time, the extremely low
stellar mass of the systems involved makes it unlikely that baryonic effects
can reduce their dark matter content. Resolving this challenge seems to require
new insights into dwarf galaxy formation, or perhaps a radical revision of the
prevailing paradigm.

fundamentally important to cell motility. A measure of the effectiveness of an
engine is the velocity the engine is able to produce at a given force, the
force-velocity curve. One type of force-velocity curve, consisting of a concave
region where velocity is insensitive to increasing force followed by a decrease
in velocity, is indicative of an adaptive response. In contrast, an engine
whose velocity rapidly decays as a convex curve in response to increasing force
would indicate a lack of adaptive response. Even taken outside of a cellular
context, branching actin networks have been observed to exhibit both concave
and convex force-velocity curves. The exact mechanism that can explain both
force-velocity curves is not yet known. We carried out an agent-based
stochastic simulation to explore such a mechanism. Our results suggest that
upon loading, branching actin networks are capable of remodeling by increasing
the number filaments growing against the load. Our model provides a mechanism
that can account for both convex and concave force-velocity relationships
observed in branching actin networks. Finally, our model gives a potential
explanation to the experimentally observed force history dependence for actin

theory the dependence of the vertex functional on the background field is
controlled by a canonical transformation w.r.t. the Batalin-Vilkovisky bracket,
naturally associated with the BRST symmetry of the theory. Since it only relies
on the Slavnov-Taylor identity of the model, this result holds both in
perturbation theory and in the non-perturbative regime. It provides a general
consistent framework for the systematic implementation of the BFM in
non-perturbative approaches to QCD, like e.g. those based on the
Schwinger-Dyson equations or the lattice, in the presence of topologically
non-trivial background configurations. The analysis is carried out in an
arbitrary (background) R_\xi-gauge.

satisfaction problem (CSP) where the constraints are preserved by a
semi-lattice operation can be solved in polynomial time. This is one of the
basic facts for the so-called universal-algebraic approach to a systematic
theory of tractability and hardness in finite domain constraint satisfaction.
  Not surprisingly, the theorem of Jeavons et al. fails for arbitrary infinite
domain CSPs. Many CSPs of practical interest, though, and in particular those
CSPs that are motivated by qualitative reasoning calculi from Artificial
Intelligence, can be formulated with constraint languages that are rather
well-behaved from a model-theoretic point of view. In particular, the
automorphism group of these constraint languages tends to be large in the sense
that the number of orbits of n-subsets of the automorphism group is bounded by
some function in n.
  In this paper we present a generalization of the theorem by Jeavons et al. to
infinite domain CSPs where the number of orbits of n-subsets grows
sub-exponentially in n, and prove that preservation under a semi-lattice
operation for such CSPs implies polynomial-time tractability. Unlike the result
of Jeavons et al., this includes many CSPs that cannot be solved by Datalog.

higher order Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). We demonstrate that a given
density field can be expressed as the sum of a linear and a nonlinear component
which are tightly coupled to each other by the tidal field tensor within the
LPT framework. The linear component corresponds to the initial density field in
Eulerian coordinates, and its mean relation with the total field can be
approximated by a logarithm (giving theoretical support to recent attempts to
find such component). We also propose to use a combination of the linearisation
method and the continuity equation to find the mapping between Eulerian and
Lagrangian coordinates. In addition, we note that this method opens the
possibility of use directly higher order LPT on nonlinear fields. We test our
linearization scheme by applying it to the z~0.5 density field from an N-body
simulation. We find that the linearised version of the full density field can
be successfully recovered on >~5 h^{-1}Mpc, reducing the skewness and kurtosis
of the distribution by about one and two orders of magnitude, respectively.
This component can also be successfully traced back in time, converging towards
the initial unevolved density field at z~100. We anticipate a number of
applications of our results, from predicting velocity fields to estimates of
the initial conditions of the universe, passing by improved constraints on
cosmological parameters derived from galaxy clustering via reconstruction
methods.

likely indicative of persistent asymmetry in the electron-scattering
photosphere. However, the degree of polarization across the Si II 6355

6355 shows enhanced polarization at the same position angle (PA) as the
polarized continuum. During two epochs near maximum, however, Si II 6355
absorption has a lower degree of polarization, with a PA that is 90deg from the
continuum. After maximum, the absorption feature has the same degree of
polarization and PA as the adjacent continuum. Another absorption feature in
the blue (either Si II 5051 or a blend with Fe II lines) shows qualitatively
similar changes, although the changes are shifted in time to an earlier epoch.
This behavior is similar to that seen in broad absorption-line quasars, where
the polarization in absorption features has been interpreted as the line
absorbing some of the unpolarized continuum flux. This behavior, along with the
90deg shifts of the polarization PA with time, imply a time-dependent
large-scale asymmetry in the explosion.

Tycho; both thought to be the remnants of Type Ia explosion events. We detect a
warm dust component in Kepler's remnant with T = 82K and mass 0.0031Msun; this
is spatially coincident with thermal X-ray emission optical knots and
filaments, consistent with the warm dust originating in the circumstellar
material swept up by the primary blast wave of the remnant. Similarly for
Tycho's remnant, we detect warm dust at 90K with mass 0.0086Msun. Comparing the
spatial distribution of the warm dust with X-rays from the ejecta and swept-up

dust is swept up interstellar material. We find no evidence of a cool (25-50 K)
component of dust with mass >0.07Msun as observed in core-collapse remnants of
massive stars. Neither the warm or cold dust components detected here are
spatially coincident with supernova ejecta material. We compare the lack of
observed supernova dust with a theoretical model of dust formation in Type Ia
remnants which predicts dust masses of 0.088(0.017)Msun for ejecta expanding
into surrounding densities of 1(5)cm-3. The model predicts that silicon- and
carbon-rich dust grains will encounter the interior edge of the observed dust
emission at 400 years confirming that the majority of the warm dust originates
from swept up circumstellar or interstellar grains (for Kepler and Tycho
respectively). The lack of cold dust grains in the ejecta suggests that Type Ia
remnants do not produce substantial quantities of iron-rich dust grains and has
important consequences for the 'missing' iron mass observed in ejecta.

improves the estimate of the cosmic flow in comparison to linear theory not

regions. In particular we test two estimates of the linear component: the log-
normal model and the iterative Lagrangian linearisation. The present approach
relies on a rigorous higher order Lagrangian perturbation theory analysis which
incorpo- rates a nonlocal relation. It does not require additional fitting from
simulations being in this sense parameter free, it is independent of
statistical-geometrical optimisation and it is straightforward and efficient to
compute. The method is demonstrated to yield an unbiased estimator of the
velocity field on scales ~> 5 Mpc/h with closely Gaussian distributed errors.
Moreover, the statistics of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field is
extremely well recovered showing a good agreement with the true one from N-body
simulations. The typical errors of about 10 km/s (1 sigma confidence intervals)
are reduced by more than 80% with respect to linear theory in the scale range

through a gaseous medium is modified by sufficiently strong large-scale
magnetic fields. Using linear perturbation theory, we calculate the structure
of the wake generated by, and the gravitational drag force on, a body traveling
in a straight-line trajectory in a uniformly magnetized medium. The functional
form of the drag force as a function of the Mach number (V_0/c_s, where V_0 is
the velocity of the body and c_s the sound speed) depends on the strength of
the magnetic field and on the angle between the velocity of the perturber and
the direction of the magnetic field. In particular, the peak value of the drag
force is not near Mach number 1 for a perturber moving in a sufficiently
magnetized medium. As a rule of thumb, we may state that for supersonic motion,
magnetic fields act to suppress dynamical friction; for subsonic motion,
magnetic fields tend to enhance dynamical friction. For perturbers moving along
the magnetic field lines, the drag force at some subsonic Mach numbers may be
stronger than it is at supersonic velocities. We also mention the relevance of
our findings to black hole coalescence in galactic nuclei.

permitting motion towards this site following a rate increase. This

cusps over a range of frequencies relevant to ground based interferometers,

compute the sensitivity (at $2 \sigma$ level) in the parameter space for AdLV,

function, i.e., the probability for an extensive air shower (EAS) to trigger an
individual detector of a ground based array as a function of distance to the
shower axis, taking into account energy, mass and direction of the primary
cosmic ray. We apply this concept to the surface array of the Pierre Auger
Observatory consisting of a 1.5 km spaced grid of about 1600 water Cherenkov
stations. Using Monte Carlo simulations of ultra-high energy showers the LTP
functions are derived for energies in the range between 10^{17} and 10^{19} eV
and zenith angles up to 65 degs. A parametrization combining a step function
with an exponential is found to reproduce them very well in the considered
range of energies and zenith angles. The LTP functions can also be obtained
from data using events simultaneously observed by the fluorescence and the
surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory (hybrid events). We validate
the Monte-Carlo results showing how LTP functions from data are in good
agreement with simulations.

Identifying the separate universe assumption as being analogous to a

the bundle, thereby allowing us to monitor evolution towards the adiabatic
limit, as well as providing a useful means of understanding the behaviour in
$f_NL$. Finally, viewing our random potential as a toy model of inflation in
the string landscape, we build distributions for observables by evolving
trajectories for a large number of realisations of the potential and comment on
the prospects for testing such models. We find the distributions for
observables to be insensitive to the number of fields over the range 2 to 6,
but that these distributions are highly sensitive to the scale of features in
the potential. Most sensitive to the scale of features is the spectral index,
with more than an order of magnitude increase in the dispersion of predictions
over the range of feature scales investigated. Least sensitive was the
non-Gaussianity parameter $f_NL$, which was consistently small; we found no
examples of realisations whose non-Gaussianity is capable of being observed by
any planned experiment.

used to identify initial perturbations with finite kinetic energy E_{0} which
generate the largest gain in perturbation kinetic energy (across all possible
time intervals) for plane Couette flow. Two different representative flow
geometries are chosen corresponding to those used previously by Butler &
Farrell (1992) and Monokrousos et al. (2011). In the former (smaller geometry)
case as E_{0} increases from 0, we find an optimal which is a smooth nonlinear
continuation of the well-known linear result at $E_{0} = 0$. At $E_{0} =
E_{c}$, however, completely unrelated states are uncovered which trigger
turbulence and our algorithm consequently fails to converge. As $E_{0}
\rightarrow E^{+}_{c}, we find good evidence that the turbulence triggering
initial conditions approach a 'minimal seed' which corresponds to the state of
lowest energy on the laminar-turbulent basin boundary or 'edge'. This situation
is repeated in the Monokrousos et al. (2011) (larger) geometry albeit with one
notable new feature - the appearance of a nonlinear optimal (as found recently
in pipe flow by Pringle & Kerswell (2010) and boundary layer flow by Cherubini
et al. (2010)) at finite $E_{0} < E_{c}$ which has a very different structure
to the linear optimal. Again the minimal seed at $E_{0} = E_{c}$ does not
resemble the linear or now the nonlinear optimal. Our results support the first
of two conjectures recently posed by Pringle et al. (2011) but contradict the
second. Importantly, their prediction that the form of the functional optimised
is not important for identifying E_{c} providing heightened values are produced
by turbulent flows is confirmed: we find the what looks to be the same E_{c}
and minimal seed using energy gain as opposed to total dissipation in the
Monokrousos et al. (2011) geometry.

has been termed) can be used to probe the distribution of mass in a galaxy that
is acting as a gravitational lens. Microlensing and nanolensing light curve
fluctuations are indicative of the mass of the compact objects within the lens,
but the size of the source is important, as large sources will smooth out a
light curve. Numerical studies have been made in the past that investigate a
range of sources sizes and masses in the lens. We extend that work in two ways
- by generating high quality maps with over a billion small objects down to a
mass of 2.5\times10-5M\odot, and by investigating the temporal properties and
observability of the nanolensing events. The system studied is a mock quasar
system similar to MG 0414+0534. We find that if variability of 0.1 mag in
amplitude can be observed, a source size of ~ 0.1 Einstein Radius (ER) would be
needed to see the effect of 2.5\times10-5M\odot masses, and larger, in the
microlensing light curve. Our investigation into the temporal properties of
nanolensing events finds that there are two scales of nanolensing that can be
observed - one due to the crossing of nanolensing caustic bands, the other due
to the crossing of nanolensing caustics themselves. The latter are very small,
having crossing times of a few days, and requiring sources of size ~ 0.0001 ER
to resolve. For sources of the size of an accretion disk, the nanolensing
caustics are slightly smoothed-out, but can be observed on time scales of a few
days. The crossing of caustic bands can be observed on times scales of about 3
months.

accurately modelled using hydrodynamic simulations. All published simulations,
however, have considered only a uniform external medium, while a stratified
external medium is expected around long duration GRB progenitors. Here we
present simulations of the dynamics of GRB jets and the resulting afterglow
emission for both uniform and stratified external media with $\rho \propto
r^{-k}$ for k = 0, 1, 2. The simulations are performed in 2D using the special
relativistic version of the Mezcal code. The dynamics for stratified external
media are broadly similar to those derived for expansion into a uniform
external medium. The jet half-opening angle start increasing logarithmically
with time once the Lorentz factor drops below 1/theta_0. For larger k values
the lateral expansion is faster at early times and slower at late times with
the jet expansion becoming Newtonian and slowly approaching spherical symmetry
over progressively longer timescales. We find that contrary to analytic
expectations, there is a reasonably sharp jet break in the lightcurve for k = 2
although the shape of the break is affected more by the viewing angle than by
the slope of the external density profile. Steeper density profiles are found
to produce more gradual jet breaks while larger viewing angles cause smoother
and later appearing jet breaks. The counter-jet becomes visible as it becomes
sub-relativistic, and for k=0 this results in a clear bump-like feature in the
light curve. However, for larger k values the jet decelerates more gradually,
causing only a mild flattening in the radio light curve that might be hard to
discern when k=2. Late time radio calorimetry is likely to consistently
over-estimate the true energy by up to a factor of a few for k=2, and either
over-predict or under-predict it by a smaller factor for k = 0,1.

bounded interval. Although there are fundamental limits on the performance of
locality preserving functions, fortunately, our problem only requires distance
preservation in the ""easier"" direction, and the well-known Hilbert

is simple from the publisher's point of view: the publisher just needs to map
the data, sort them, group them, add Laplace noise and publish the dataset. The

explore the evolution of the sub-millimeter brightness. The model galaxy is
employed from an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic simulation of a primordial
galaxy by Mori & Umemura, where the SFR is ~ 10 Msun/yr at t<0.3 Gyr and
several Msun/yr at t>0.3 Gyr. The former phase well reproduces the observed
properties of LAEs and the latter does LBGs. We solve the three-dimensional
radiative transfer in the clumpy interstellar media in this model galaxy,
taking the size distributions of dust grains into account, and calculate the
dust temperature as a function of galactic evolutionary time. We find that the
clumpiness of interstellar media plays an important role for the sub-millimeter
brightness. In the LAE phase, dust grains are concentrated on clumpy
star-forming regions that are distributed all over the galaxy, and the grains
can effectively absorb UV radiation from stars. As a result, the dust is heated
up to T>35 K. In the LBG phase, the continuous supernovae drive dust grains far
away from star-forming regions. Then, the grains cannot absorb much radiation
from stars, and becomes into a cold state close to the CMB temperature.
Consequently, the dust temperature decreases with the evolutionary time, where
the mass-weighted mean temperature is T=26 K at t=0.1 Gyr and T=21 K at t=1.0
Gyr. By this analysis, it turns out that the sub-millimeter brightness is
higher in the LAE phase than that in the LBG phase, although the dust-to-gas
ratio increases monotonically as a function of time. We derive the spectral
energy distributions by placing the model galaxy at a given redshift. The peak
flux at 850 micron is found to be S_850 ~ 0.2 - 0.9 mJy if the model galaxy is
placed at 6>z>2. This means that ALMA can detect an early star-forming galaxy
with SFR of ~ 10 Msun/yr by less than one hour integration with 16 antennas.

embedded into low-acceleration bubbles where modified gravity theories a` la
MOND predict significant deviations from Newton's laws. As has been pointed out
recently, the Earth-Sun bubble may be visited by the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft
in the near future, providing a unique occasion to put these theories to a

System's gravitational potential to determine accurate positions and motions of
these saddle points and study the predicted dynamical anomalies within the
framework of quasi-linear MOND. Considering the expected sensitivity of the
LISA Pathfinder probe, we argue that interpolation functions which exhibit a
""faster"" transition between the two dynamical regimes have a good chance of
surviving a null result. An example of such a function is the QMOND analog of
the so-called simple interpolating function which agrees well with much of the
extragalactic phenomenology. We have also discovered that several of Saturn's
outermost satellites periodically intersect the Saturn-Sun bubble, providing
the first example of Solar System objects that regularly undergo the MOND

transceiver design criteria including weighted mean-square-error (MSE)
minimization, capacity maximization, worst-MSE/MAX-MSE minimization and
weighted sum-rate maximization, are considered and unified into a single
matrix-variate optimization problem. A general robust design algorithm is
proposed to solve the unified problem. Specifically, by exploiting majorization
theory and properties of matrix-variate functions, the optimal structure of the
robust transceiver is derived when either the covariance matrix of channel
estimation errors seen from the transmitter side or the corresponding
covariance matrix seen from the receiver side is proportional to an identity
matrix. Based on the optimal structure, the original transceiver design
problems are reduced to much simpler problems with only scalar variables whose
solutions are readily obtained by iterative water-filling algorithm. A number
of existing transceiver design algorithms are found to be special cases of the
proposed solution. The differences between our work and the existing related
work are also discussed in detail. The performance advantages of the proposed

then the problem can be solved in linear time. For a Hamming graph $G$ having
thresholds $\theta(v)=2$ for each vertex $v$ of $G$, we precisely determine an
optimal target set $S$ for $(G,\theta)$. These results partially answer an open
problem raised by Dreyer and Roberts \cite{Dreyer2009}.

present-day L* galaxies. Clustering analyses have suggested that LAEs at z ~ 3
might evolve into LAEs at z ~ 2, but it is unclear whether the physical nature
of these galaxies is compatible with this hypothesis. Several groups have
investigated the properties of LAEs using spectral energy distribution (SED)
fitting, but direct comparison of their results is complicated by
inconsistencies in the treatment of the data and in the assumptions made in
modeling the stellar populations, which are degenerate with the effects of
galaxy evolution. By using the same data analysis pipeline and SED fitting
software on two stacked samples of LAEs at z = 3.1 and z = 2.1, and by
eliminating several systematic uncertainties that might cause a discrepancy, we
determine that the physical properties of these two samples of galaxies are
dramatically different. LAEs at z = 3.1 are found to be old (age ~ 1 Gyr) and
metal-poor (Z < 0.2 Z_Sun), while LAEs at z = 2.1 appear to be young (age ~ 50
Myr) and metal-rich (Z > Z_Sun). The difference in the observed stellar ages
makes it very unlikely that z = 3.1 LAEs evolve directly into z = 2.1 LAEs.
Larger samples of galaxies, studies of individual objects and spectroscopic
measurements of metallicity at these redshifts are needed to confirm this
picture, which is difficult to reconcile with the effects of 1 Gyr of
cosmological evolution.

  Position",,,,,"cs.CG cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interference at a wireless node s can be modelled by the number of
wireless nodes whose transmission ranges cover s. Given a set of positions for
wireless nodes, the interference minimization problem is to assign a
transmission radius (equivalently, a power level) to each node such that the
resulting communication graph is connected, while minimizing the maximum
interference. We consider the model introduced by von Rickenback et al. (2005),
in which each transmission range is represented by a ball and edges in the
communication graph are symmetric. The problem is NP-complete in two dimensions
(Buchin 2008) and no polynomial-time approximation algorithm is known.
Furthermore, even in one dimension (the highway model), the problem's
complexity is unknown and the maximum interference of a set of n wireless nodes
can be as high as Theta(sqrt(n)) (von Rickenback et al. 2005). In this paper we
show how to solve the problem efficiently in settings typical for wireless ad
hoc networks. In particular, we show that if node positions are represented by
a set P of n points selected uniformly and independently at random over a
d-dimensional rectangular region, for any fixed d, then the topology given by
the closure of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of P has maximum
interference O(log n) with high probability. We extend this bound to a general
class of communication graphs over a broad set of probability distributions.
Next we present a local algorithm that constructs a graph from this class; this
is the first local algorithm to provide an upper bound on the expected maximum
interference. Finally, we discuss an empirical evaluation of our algorithm with
a suite of simulation results.

right-handed neutrinos are gauge singlets, and may therefore have large
Majorana masses. The standard seesaw mechanism, however, does not address the
apparent lack of hierarchy in the neutrino masses compared to the quarks and
charged leptons, nor the large leptonic mixing angles compared to the small
angles of the CKM matrix. In this paper, we will show that the singlet nature
of the right-handed neutrinos may be taken advantage of in one further way in
order to solve these remaining problems: Unlike particles with gauge
interactions, whose numbers are constrained by anomaly cancellation, the number
of gauge singlet particles is essentially undetermined. If large numbers of
gauge singlet fermions are present at high energies - as is suggested, for
example, by various string constructions - then the effective low energy
neutrino mass matrix may be determined as a sum over many distinct Yukawa
couplings, with the largest ones being the most important. This can reduce
hierarchy, and lead to large mixing angles. Assuming a statistical distribution
of fundamental parameters, we will show that this scenario leads to a good fit
to low energy phenomenology, with only a few qualitative assumptions guided by
the known quark and lepton masses. The scenario leads to predictions of a
normal hierarchy for the neutrino masses, and a value for the |m_ee| mass
matrix element of about 1-6 meV.

evaluate the effect of the distributed greedy heuristic on aggregate utility

that near-IR (3 {\mu}m)-mid- IR (11 {\mu}m) color can be used as an indicator
of the specific star formation rate and the presence of intermediate age
stellar populations. From the MIR observations, we find that red-sequence
galaxies consist not only of passively evolving red early-type galaxies, but
also of 1) ""weak-SFG"" (disk-dominated star-forming galaxies which have star
formation rates lower by \sim 4 \times than blue-cloud galaxies), and 2)
""intermediate- MXG"" (bulge-dominated galaxies showing stronger MIR dust
emission than normal red early-type galaxies). Those two populations can be a
set of transition galaxies from blue, star-forming, late-type galaxies evolving
into red, quiescent, early-type ones. We find that the weak-SFG are predominant
at intermediate masses (1010M\odot < M\star < 1010.5M\odot) and are typically
found in local densities similar to the outskirts of galaxy clusters. As much
as 40% of the supercluster member galaxies in this mass range can be classified
as weak-SFGs, but their proportion decreases to < 10% at larger masses (M\star
> 1010.5 M\odot) at any galaxy density. The fraction of the intermediate-MXG
among red- sequence galaxies at 1010M\odot < M\star < 1011M\odot also decreases
as the density and mass increase. In particular, \sim42% of the red-sequence
galaxies with early-type morphologies are classified as intermediate-MXG at
intermediate densities. These results suggest that the star formation activity
is strongly dependent on the stellar mass, but that the morphological
transformation is mainly controlled by the environment.

we show that the Euclidean distance-based distortion of a unit norm complex

Euclidean path integral for the Holst action with non-zero cosmological

be satisfied by the spacetime manifold in order for the Holst action and its
surface integral to be non-zero: (i) the metric has to be non-diagonalizable;
(ii) the Pontryagin number of the manifold has to be non-zero. The latter is a
strong topological condition, and rules out many of the known solutions to the
Einstein field equations. This result leads us to evaluate the on-shell
first-order Holst action and corresponding Euclidean partition function on the
Taub-NUT-ADS solution. We find that $\gamma$ shows up as a finite rotation of
the on-shell partition function which corresponds to shifts in the energy and
entropy of the NUT charge. In an appendix we also evaluate the Holst action on
the Taub-NUT and Taub-bolt solutions in flat spacetime and find that in that

equivalence relations on barriers on the Ellentuck space. We then apply our

ultrafilter which is Tukey reducible to $\mathcal{U}_1$ is isomorphic to a
countable iteration of Fubini products of ultrafilters from among a fixed
countable collection of ultrafilters. Moreover, we show that there is exactly
one Tukey type of nonprincipal ultrafilters strictly below that of

$r=|x_1-x_2|_p$ with the center at $x_1$ or at $x_2$. If the 2-periodic cycle
is an indifferent, then in each step the balls transfer to each other. All the
other spheres with radius $>r$ and the center at $x_1$ and $x_2$ are invariant
independently of the attractiveness of the cycle.
  (ii) In the case where the fixed point $x_0$ is unique we prove that if the
point is attracting then there exists $\delta>0$, such that the basin of
attraction for $x_0$ is the ball of radius $\delta$ and the center at $x_0$ and
any sphere with radius $\geq \delta$ is invariant.
  If $x_0$ is an indifferent point then all spheres with the center at $x_0$
are invariant. If $x_0$ is a repelling point then there exits $\delta>0$, such
that the trajectory which starts at an element of the ball of radius $\delta$
with the center in $x_0$ leaves this ball, whereas any sphere with radius $\geq
\delta$ is invariant.
  (iii) In case of existence of two fixed points, we show that Siegel disks may
either coincide or be disjoint for different fixed points of the dynamical
system. Besides, we find the basin of the attractor of the system. Varying the
parameters it is proven that there exists an integer $k\geq 2$, and spheres
$S_{r_1}(x_i), ..., S_{r_k}(x_i)$ such that the limiting trajectory will be
periodically traveling the spheres $S_{r_j}$. For some values of the parameters
there are trajectories which go arbitrary far from the fixed points.

coordinates of image before embedding the watermark. The proposed algorithm is
flexible depending on the length of the watermark text. If the length of the
watermark text is more than ((MxN)/8)-2 the proposed algorithm will also embed
the extra of the watermark text in the second LSB. We compare our proposed
algorithm with the 1-LSB algorithm and Lee's algorithm using Peak

curves which allow estimating the lower mass limits of a subsample of objects.
We measured fluxes and intensity ratios of the emission lines in the visible
region of the spectrum (lambda 4000-9000 A) for 75 galaxy members. Moreover,
for some of them (55%), the spectra obtained with the Keck II telescope have
sufficient wavelength and spatial resolution to derive their rotation curve.
These galaxies turn out to be disk like systems, with a high fraction (~50%) of
interacting systems. The spectroscopic classification of 42 galaxies, using the
emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams, shows that the NEPR sample is
predominantly composed of starburst galaxies (71%), while the fraction of AGNs
(7%) and LINERs (21%) is small. The dynamical analysis allows us to estimate
the lower mass limits of 39 galaxies. The rest-frame FIR luminosity
distribution of these galaxies spans the same range as that of the FIR selected
complete sample, i.e. three orders of magnitude, with the same mean value,
log(L_FIR)=10.2. This emphasizes that such galaxies represent FIR properties of
the whole sample well. Moreover, their optical properties are typical of the
sample itself since 62% of these belong to the 60mu selected complete sample.

in order to follow the evolution of the problem domains. Generally, the
software system architecture cannot follow the rapid evolution of a problem
domain which results in the discrepancies between the implemented and designed
architecture. Software architecture illustrates a system's structure and global
properties and consequently determines not only how the system should be
constructed but also leads its evolution. Architecture plays an important role
to ensure that a system satisfies its business and mission goals during
implementation and evolution. However, the capabilities of the designed
architecture may possibly be lost when the implementation does not conform to
the designed architecture. Such a loss of consistency causes the risk of
architectural decay. The architectural decay can be avoided if architectural
changes are made as early as possible. The paper presents the Process Model for
Architecture-Centric Evolution which improves the quality of software systems
through maintaining consistency between designed architecture and
implementation. It also increases architecture awareness of developers which
assists in minimizing the risk of architectural decay. In the proposed approach
consistency checks are performed before and after the change implementation.

Shannon entropy shows large variation in amplitude of the oscillation, the EUR
is maintained throughout time for all cases and it confirms its generality. We
also study the dynamics in a very tight trap when the condensate becomes highly

aperiodic and fluctuating nature in very tight trap. We also calculate

and, as a result, the magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{M}$) is extremely
sensitive to the direction of applied field and can be negative (normal MCE) or
positive (inverse MCE). For hexagonal HoMnO$_3$ and YbMnO$_3$ systems, a very
small inverse MCE is observed only for $H$ parallel to c axis and it decreases
with increasing $H$ and crosses over to normal one above $H_c$. On the other
hand, for orthorhombic DyMnO$_3$ and TbMnO$_3$, though the inverse MCE
disappears above $H_c$ along easy-axis of magnetization, it increases rapidly

problem: those that are fast but compute unsatisfying approximation ratios, and
those that guarantee high quality ratios but are slow. In this paper we prove
that this tradeoff between runtime and solution quality is necessary. For the
problem a minimum number of edges in a graph need to be found that, when cut,
partition the vertices into k equal-sized sets. We develop a reduction
framework which identifies some necessary conditions on the considered graph
class in order to prove the hardness of the problem. We focus on two
combinatorially simple but very different classes, namely trees and solid grid
graphs. The latter are finite connected subgraphs of the infinite 2D grid
without holes. First we use the framework to show that for solid grid graphs it
is NP-hard to approximate the optimum number of cut edges within any satisfying
ratio. Then we consider solutions in which the sets may deviate from being
equal-sized. Our framework is used on grids and trees to prove that no fully
polynomial time algorithm exists that computes solutions in which the sets are
arbitrarily close to equal-sized. This is true even if the number of edges cut
is allowed to increase the more stringent the limit on the set sizes is. These
are the first bicriteria inapproximability results for the problem.

tedious problem. This is because of the foreground components of the night sky
brightness, much larger than the EBL itself: the Zodiacal Light (ZL),
Integrated Starlight (ISL), Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL) and, for ground-based
observations, the Airglow (AGL) and the tropospheric scattered light. We have
been developing a method for the EBL measurement which utilises the screening
effect of a dark nebula on the EBL. A differential measurement in the direction
of a high-latitude dark nebula and its surrounding area provides a signal that
is due to two components only, i.e. the EBL and the diffusely scattered ISL
from the cloud. We present a progress report of this method where we are now
utilising intermediate resolution spectroscopy with ESO's VLT telescope. We
detect and remove the scattered ISL component by using its characteristic
Fraunhofer line spectral signature. In contrast to the ISL, in the EBL spectrum
all spectral lines are washed out. We present a high quality spectrum
representing the difference between an opaque position within our target cloud

vapour diffusion. For contact angles below $90^\circ$, the evaporative flux
from the droplet tends to diverge in the vicinity of the contact line.
Therefore, the description of the flow inside an evaporating drop has remained
a challenge. Here, we focus on the asymptotic behaviour near the pinned contact
line, by analytically solving the Stokes equations in a wedge geometry of
arbitrary contact angle. The flow field is described by similarity solutions,
with exponents that match the singular boundary condition due to evaporation.
We demonstrate that there are three contributions to the flow in a wedge: the
evaporative flux, the downward motion of the liquid-air interface and the
eigenmode solution which fulfils the homogeneous boundary conditions. Below a
critical contact angle of $133.4^\circ$, the evaporative flux solution will
dominate, while above this angle the eigenmode solution dominates. We
demonstrate that for small contact angles, the velocity field is very
accurately described by the lubrication approximation. For larger contact
angles, the flow separates into regions where the flow is reversing towards the
drop centre.

techniques that we designate as Source Localization with Nuclear Norm (SLNN)
and Source Localization with l1-norm (SL-l1), which extend to arbitrary real
dimensions, including 3D, our prior work on 2D source localization formulated
in the complex plane. Broadly, our approach is based on formulating a
Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation problem for the source position, and then
using convex relaxation techniques to obtain a semidefinite program (SDP) that
can be globally and efficiently solved. SLNN directly approximates the Gaussian
ML solution, and the relaxation is shown to be tighter than in other methods in
the same class. We present an analysis of the convexity properties of the
constraint set for the 2D complex version of SLNN (SLCP) to justify the
observed tightness of the relaxation. In terms of global accuracy of
localization, SLNN outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based methods with
either iterative or closed-form formulations. We propose the SL-l1 algorithm to
address the Laplacian noise case, which models the presence of outliers in
range measurements. We overcome the nondifferentiability of the Laplacian
likelihood function by rewriting the ML problem as an exact weighted version of
the Gaussian case, and compare two solution strategies. One of them is
iterative, based on block coordinate descent, and uses SLNN as a subprocessing
block. The other, attaining only slightly worse performance, is noniterative
and based on an SDP relaxation of the weighted ML problem.

sequential program, scalable parallelization on many-core processors involves
hard and interesting parallelism adaptation and mapping challenges. These
challenges include tailoring data locality to the memory hierarchy, structuring
independent tasks hierarchically to exploit multiple levels of parallelism,
tuning the synchronization grain, balancing the execution load, decoupling the
execution into thread-level pipelines, and leveraging heterogeneous hardware
with specialized accelerators. The polyhedral framework allows to model,
construct and apply very complex loop nest transformations addressing most of
the parallelism adaptation and mapping challenges. But apart from
hardware-specific, back-end oriented transformations (if-conversion, trace
scheduling, value prediction), loop nest optimization has essentially ignored
dynamic and speculative techniques. Research in polyhedral compilation recently
reached a significant milestone towards the support of dynamic, data-dependent
control flow. This opens a large avenue for blending dynamic analyses and
speculative techniques with advanced loop nest optimizations. Selecting
real-world examples from SPEC benchmarks and numerical kernels, we make a case
for the design of synergistic static, dynamic and speculative loop

anomalies in the low-field isothermal magnetization curves, is in contradiction
with our earlier results in the underdoped La(1.9)Sr(0.1)CuO(4) [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 84, 3157 (2000)]. These seemingly intrinsic anomalies are being presented
in various influential works as a 'thermodynamic evidence' for phase incoherent
superconductivity in the pseudogap regime, this last being at present a central
and debated issue of the cuprate superconductors' physics. Here we have
extended our magnetization measurements in La(1.9)Sr(0.1)CuO(4) to two samples
with different chemical disorder, in one of them close to the one associated
with the random distribution of Sr ions. For this sample, the corresponding
Tc-distribution may be approximated as symmetric around the average Tc, while
in the most disordered sample is strongly asymmetric. The comparison between
the magnetization measured in both samples provides a crucial check of the
chemical disorder origin of the observed diamagnetism anomalies, which are
similar to those claimed as due to phase fluctuations by other authors. This
conclusion applies also to the sample affected only by the intrinsic-like
chemical disorder, providing then a further check that the intrinsic
diamagnetism above the superconducting transition of underdoped cuprates is not
affected by the opening of a pseudogap in the normal state. It is also shown
here that once these disorder effects are overcome, the remaining precursor
diamagnetism may be accounted at a quantitative level in terms of the GGL
approach under a total energy cutoff.

a long period showed an increased packing factor, a larger intergrain contact

solid-state self-sintering of MgB2. Consequently the connectivity of the
sintered ex-situ samples exceeded the typical connectivity range 5-15% of the

connectivity potential of ex-situ MgB2, though its intergrain coupling is not

superposition of two almost anti-parallel propagating parametric waves making a

contrasts with the classical Faraday parametric waves, which are exactly

unraveling the physical processes at work on local and global scales. We wish
to expand the sample of extreme starbursts, represented by local LIRGs and
ULIRGs, with high quality observations in the 1-0 line of HCN. We study if a
universal law can account for the star formation relations observed for the
dense molecular gas in normal star forming galaxies and extreme starbursts. We
have used the IRAM 30m telescope to observe a sample of 19 LIRGs in the 1-0
lines of CO, HCN and HCO+. The analysis of the new data proves that the
efficiency of star formation in the dense molecular gas (SFE-dense) of extreme
starbursts is a factor 3-4 higher compared to normal galaxies. We find a
duality in Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws that is reinforced if we account for the
different conversion factor for HCN (alpha-HCN) in extreme starbursts and for
the unobscured star formation rate in normal galaxies. This result extends to
the higher molecular densities probed by HCN lines the more extreme bimodal
behavior of star formation laws, derived from CO molecular lines by two recent
surveys. We have confronted our observations with the predictions of
theoretical models in which the efficiency of star formation is determined by
the ratio of a constant star formation rate per free-fall time (SFR-ff) to the
local free-fall time. We find that it is possible to fit the observed
differences in the SFE-dense between normal galaxies and LIRGs/ULIRGs using a
common constant SFR-ff and a set of physically acceptable HCN densities, but
only if SFR-ff~0.005-0.01 and/or if alpha-HCN is a factor of a few lower than
our favored values. Star formation recipes that explicitly depend on the galaxy
global dynamical time scales do not significantly improve the fit to the new
HCN data presented in this work.

early-type galaxies by searching for obscured emission using Spitzer Space
Telescope mid-infrared (MIR) imaging at 24mu. Of a total sample of 95
early-type galaxies, 53 objects are detected, including 16 showing
kiloparsec-scale dust in optical images. One dimensional and two dimensional
surface photometry of the 37 detections without extended dust features reveals
that the MIR light is more centrally concentrated than the optical light as
traced by Hubble Space Telescope F850LP-band images. No such modeling was
performed for the sources with dust detected in the optical images. We explore
several possible sources of the MIR excess emission, including obscured nuclear
emission. We find that radial metallicity gradients in the stellar population
appear to be a natural and most likely explanation for the observed behavior in
a majority of the sources. Alternatively, if the concentrated MIR emission were
due to nuclear activity, it would imply a MIR-to-X luminosity ratio ~5-10 for
the low luminosity AGN detected in X-rays by our survey. This ratio is an order
of magnitude larger than that of typical low-luminosity AGN and would imply an
unusual spectral energy distribution. We conclude that the black holes found by
our survey in quiescent early-type galaxies in Virgo have low bolometric
Eddington ratios arising from low accretion rates and/or highly radiatively
inefficient accretion.

unambiguous detection at optical wavelengths of the `iron curtain' of disc
material which has been previously reported to veil the white dwarf in this

a distortion of the outer disc that we see also in Doppler images. This is
evidence for considerable radial motion in the outer disk, at up to 90 km/s

mechanism in nova outbursts for a wide range of possible compositions of the
layer underlying the accreted envelope. Previous surveys studied this mechanism
only for solar composition matter accreted on top of carbon oxygen (C-O) white
dwarfs. Since, during the runaway, mixing with carbon enhances the hydrogen
burning rates dramatically, one should question whether significant enrichment
of the ejecta is possible also for other underlying compositions (He, O, Ne,
Mg), predicted by stellar evolution models. We simulated several non-carbon
cases and found significant amounts of those underlying materials in the
ejected hydrogen layer. Despite large differences in rates, time scales and
energetics between the cases, our results show that the convective dredge up
mechanism predicts significant enrichment in all our non-carbon cases,
including helium enrichment in recurrent novae. The results are consistent with
observations.

observations of indirect dark matter detection experiments in all possible
cosmic-ray channels. For this purpose we calculate in detail the gravitino
decay widths in theories with bilinear violation of R parity, particularly
focusing on decay channels with three particles in the final state. Based on
these calculations we predict the fluxes of gamma rays, charged cosmic rays and
neutrinos expected from decays of gravitino dark matter. Although the predicted
spectra could in principal explain the anomalies observed in the cosmic-ray
positron and electron fluxes as measured by PAMELA and Fermi LAT, we find that
this possibility is ruled out by strong constraints from gamma-ray and
antiproton observations.
  Therefore, we employ current data of indirect detection experiments to place
strong constraints on the gravitino lifetime and the strength of R-parity
violation. In addition, we discuss the prospects of forthcoming searches for a
gravitino signal in the spectrum of cosmic-ray antideuterons, finding that they
are in particular sensitive to rather low gravitino masses. Finally, we discuss
in detail the prospects for detecting a neutrino signal from gravitino dark
matter decays, finding that the sensitivity of neutrino telescopes like IceCube
is competitive to observations in other cosmic ray channels, especially for
rather heavy gravitinos.
  Moreover, we discuss the prospects for a direct detection of gravitino dark
matter via R-parity violating inelastic scatterings off nucleons. We find that,
although the scattering cross section is considerably enhanced compared to the
case of elastic gravitino scattering, the expected signal is many orders of
magnitude too small in order to hope for a detection in underground detectors.

Reynolds numbers of Re = 5 x 10^5 to 2 x 10^6 with a stationary outer cylinder
and a mean bubble diameter around 1 mm. We measure the drag reduction (DR)
based on the global dimensional torque as a function of the global gas volume
fraction a_global over the range 0% to 4%. We observe a moderate DR of up to 7%
for Re = 5.1 x 10^5. Significantly stronger DR is achieved for Re = 1.0 x 10^6
and 2.0 x 10^6 with, remarkably, more than 40% of DR at Re = 2.0 x 10^6 and
a_global = 4%.
  To shed light on the two apparently different regimes of moderate DR and
strong DR, we investigate the local liquid flow velocity and the local bubble
statistics, in particular the radial gas concentration profiles and the bubble
size distribution, for the two different cases; Re = 5.1 x 10^5 in the moderate
DR regime and Re = 1.0 x 10^6 in the strong DR regime, both at a_global = 3 +/-
0.5%.
  By defining and measuring a local bubble Weber number (We) in the TC gap
close to the IC wall, we observe that the crossover from the moderate to the
strong DR regime occurs roughly at the crossover of We ~ 1. In the strong DR
regime at Re = 1.0 x 10^6 we find We > 1, reaching a value of 9 (+7, -2) when
approaching the inner wall, indicating that the bubbles increasingly deform as
they draw near the inner wall. In the moderate DR regime at Re = 5.1 x 10^5 we
find We ~ 1, indicating more rigid bubbles, even though the mean bubble
diameter is larger, namely 1.2 (+0.7, -0.1) mm, as compared to the Re = 1.0 x
10^6 case, where it is 0.9 (+0.6, -0.1) mm. We conclude that bubble
deformability is a relevant mechanism behind the observed strong DR. These
local results match and extend the conclusions from the global flow experiments
as found by van den Berg et al. (2005) and from the numerical simulations by
Lu, Fernandez & Tryggvason (2005).

images taken a couple of months earlier, when the X-ray flux was a factor of 2
higher. We conclude that during the 2010 September observations, the optical
counterpart was dominated by emission from an irradiated disk (which responds
to the varying X-ray luminosity), rather than by a star cluster around the
black hole (which would not change). We modelled the Comptonized, irradiated
X-ray spectrum of the disk, and found that the optical luminosity and colours
in the 2010 November data are still consistent with emission from the
irradiated disk, with a characteristic outer radius r_{out} ~ 2800 r_{in} ~
10^{13} cm and a reprocessing fraction ~ 2 x 10^{-3}. The optical colours are
also consistent with a stellar population with age <~ 6 Myr (at solar
metallicity) and mass ~ 10^4 M_{sun}; this is only an upper limit to the mass,
if there is also a significant contribution from an irradiated disk. We
strongly rule out the presence of a young super-star-cluster, which would be
too bright. An old globular cluster might be associated with HLX-1, as long as
its mass <~ 2 x 10^6 M_{sun} for an age of 10 Gyr, but it cannot significantly
contribute to the observed very blue and variable optical/UV emission.

is measured using a wide-gap Couette rheometer equipped with a Particle Image
Velocimetry (PIV) device that allows measuring the velocity field. The
suspensions made of PMMA particles (31$\mu$m in diameter) suspended in a
Newtonian index- and density-matched liquid are transparent enough to allow an
accurate measurement of the local velocity for particle concentrations as high
as 50%. In the wide-gap Couette cell, the shear induced particle migration is
evidenced by the measurement of the time evolution of the flow profile. A
peculiar radial zone in the gap is identified where the viscosity remains
constant. At this special location, the local particle volume fraction is taken
to be the mean particle concentration. The local shear transient response of
the suspensions when the shear flow is reversed is measured at this point where
the particle volume fraction is well defined. The local rheological
measurements presented here confirm the macroscopic measurements of
Gadala-Maria and Acrivos (1980). After shear reversal, the viscosity undergoes
a step-like reduction, decreases slower and passes through a minimum before
increasing again to reach a plateau. Upon varying the particle concentration,
we have been able to show that the minimum and the plateau viscosities do not
obey the same scaling law with respect to the particle volume fraction. These
experimental results are consistent with the scaling predicted by Mills and
Snabre (2009) and with the results of numerical simulation performed on random
suspensions [Sierou and Brady (2001)]. The minimum seems to be associated with
the viscosity of an isotropic suspension, or at least of a suspension whose
particles do not interact through non-hydrodynamic forces, while the plateau
value would correspond to the viscosity of a suspension structured by the shear
where the non-hydrodynamic forces play a crucial role.

consider a very complete set of chemical families, including hydrocarbons and
aromatics, hydrides, halogens and phosphorous-bearing species. Derived
abundances are compared to the latest observational data from large surveys and
Herschel. Results. The shocks induce a non-equilibrium chemistry in the dust
formation zone of IRC+10216 where the collision destruction of CO in the
post-shock gas triggers the formation of O-bearing species (H2O, SiO). Most of
the modelled abundances agree very well with the latest values derived from
Herschel data on IRC+10216. Hydrides form a family of abundant species that are
expelled into the intermediate envelope. In particular, HF traps all the atomic
fluorine in the dust formation zone. Halogens are also abundant and their
chemistry is independent of the C/O ratio of the star. Therefore, HCl and other
Cl-bearing species should also be present in the inner wind of O-rich AGB or
supergiant stars. We identify a specific region ranging from 2.5 R* to 4 R*,
where polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form and grow. The estimated carbon
dust-to-gas mass ratio derived from the mass of aromatics ranges from 1.2 x
10^(-3) to 5.8 x 10^{-3} and agrees well with existing observational values.
The aromatic formation region is located outside hot layers where SiC2 is
produced as a bi-product of silicon carbide dust synthesis. Finally, we predict
that some molecular lines will show flux variation with pulsation phase and
time (e.g., H2O) while other species will not (e.g., CO). These variations
merely reflect the non-equilibrium chemistry that destroys and reforms
molecules over a pulsation period in the shocked gas of the dust formation
zone.

defined fundamentally by a topological field theory with a quantized axion
angle theta of zero or pi. It was recently shown that fractional quantized
values of theta are consistent with time-reversal invariance if deconfined,
gapped, fractionally charged bulk excitations appear in the low-energy spectrum
due to strong correlation effects, leading to the concept of a fractional
topological insulator. These fractionally charged excitations are coupled to
emergent gauge fields which ensure that the microscopic degrees of freedom, the
original electrons, are gauge-invariant objects. A first step towards the
construction of microscopic models of fractional topological insulators is to
understand the nature of these emergent gauge theories and their corresponding
phases. In this work, we show that low-energy effective gauge theories of both
Abelian or non-Abelian type are consistent with a fractional quantized axion
angle if they admit a Coulomb phase or a Higgs phase with gauge group broken
down to a discrete subgroup. The Coulomb phases support gapless but
electrically neutral bulk excitations while the Higgs phases are fully gapped.
The Higgs and non-Abelian Coulomb phases exhibit multiple ground states on
boundaryless spatial 3-manifolds with nontrivial first homology, while the
Abelian Coulomb phase has a unique ground state. The ground state degeneracy
receives an additional contribution on manifolds with boundary due to the
induced boundary Chern-Simons term.

reinforce coherence. We conclude from various details of the mathematical

arranged in terms of a formation time constraint such that coherent emissions
can be treated consistently. Emerging partons are hadronised by the Lund string
model, tuned to describe LEP data in conjunction with the parton shower. Based

the stochastic Schr\""odinger equation with stochastic coefficients, which was
mathematically introduced in the '90s, and we develop it in order to describe
the non Markovian evolution of a quantum system continuously measured and
controlled thanks to a measurement based feedback. Indeed, realistic
descriptions of a feedback loop have to include delay and thus need a non
Markovian theory. The theory allows to put together non Markovian evolutions
and measurements in continuous time in agreement with the modern axiomatic
formulation of quantum mechanics. To illustrate the possibilities of such a
theory, we apply it to a two-level atom stimulated by a laser. We introduce
closed loop control too, via the stimulating laser, with the aim to enhance the
""squeezing"" of the emitted light, or other typical quantum properties. Note
that here we change the point of view with respect to the usual applications of
control theory. In our model the ""system"" is the two-level atom, but we do not
want to control its state, to bring the atom to a final target state. Our aim
is to control the ""Mandel $Q$-parameter"" and the spectrum of the emitted light;
in particular the spectrum is not a property at a single time, but involves a
long interval of times (a Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of
the observed output is needed).

broad, or wide peaks in scattering or production processes. In the eyes of
nearly all experimentalists, any suchlike bump is a true resonance as soon as
its statistical significance exceeds certain minimal values. However, this
simple point of view ignores possible effects from competing hadronic channels
and the opening of the corresponding thresholds. On the other hand, most
theoretical hadron-model builders consider mesons merely bound states of a
quark and an antiquark, or of more exotic combinations sometimes involving
valence gluons as well. Also the latter description is much too naive, since
considerable mass shifts or even the dynamical generation of extra states due
to unquenching are equally ignored.
  In the present paper, a largely empirical yet very successful approach to
meson spectroscopy is revisited, in which all the above phenomena can be
accounted for non-perturbatively, with concrete examples of some enigmatic
mesonic states described in detail. First, the X(4260) charmonium enhancement
is argued to be a non-resonant structure resulting from depletion effects due
to competing channels and resonances. Then, the X(3872) charmonium-like meson
is described as a unitarised $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $c\bar{c}$ state. Also, the
unusual pattern of masses and widths of the open-charm axial-vector mesons
$D_1(2420)$, $D_1(2430)$, $D_{s1}(2536)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ is shown to follow
from highly non-perturbative coupled-channel and mixing effects. Finally, first
indications of a very light scalar boson are presented, on the basis of

great importance, in particular when the observational data are compared with
theoretical models. To this aim, we have developed an algorithm solving the
radiative transfer equation in the Fokker-Planck approximation when both
thermal and bulk Comptonization take place. The algorithm is essentially a
relaxation method, where stable solutions are obtained when the system has
reached its steady-state equilibrium. We obtained the solution of the radiative
transfer equation in the two-dimensional domain defined by the photon energy E
and optical depth of the system tau using finite-differences for the partial
derivatives, and imposing specific boundary conditions for the solutions. We
treated the case of cylindrical accretion onto a magnetized neutron star. We
considered a blackbody seed spectrum of photons with exponential distribution
across the accretion column and for an accretion where the velocity reaches its
maximum at the stellar surface and at the top of the accretion column,
respectively. In both cases higher values of the electron temperature and of
the optical depth tau produce flatter and harder spectra. Other parameters
contributing to the spectral formation are the steepness of the vertical
velocity profile, the albedo at the star surface, and the radius of the
accretion column. The latter parameter modifies the emerging spectra in a
specular way for the two assumed accretion profiles. The algorithm has been
implemented in the XSPEC package for X-ray spectral fitting and is specifically
dedicated to the physical framework of accretion at the polar cap of a neutron
star with a high magnetic field (> 10^{12} G), which is expected to be typical
of accreting systems such as X-ray pulsars and supergiant fast X-ray
transients.

oxides with layered structure, RAMO$_4$, where R$^{3+}$=In or Sc; A$^{3+}$=Al
or Ga; and M$^{2+}$=Ca, Cd, Mg, or Zn, are investigated using first-principles
density functional approach. The compositional complexity of RAMO$_4$ leads to
a wide range of band gap values varying from 2.45 eV for InGaCdO$_4$ to 6.29 eV
for ScAlMgO$_4$. Strikingly, despite the different band gaps in the oxide
constituents, namely, 2-4 eV in CdO, In$_2$O$_3$, or ZnO; 5-6 for Ga$_2$O$_3$
or Sc$_2$O$_3$; and 7-9 eV in CaO, MgO, or Al$_2$O$_3$, the bottom of the
conduction band in the multicomponent oxides is formed from the s-states of all
cations and their neighboring oxygen p-states. We show that the hybrid nature
of the conduction band in multicomponent oxides originates from the unusual
five-fold atomic coordination of A$^{3+}$ and M$^{2+}$ cations which enables
the interaction between the spatially-spread s-orbitals of adjacent cations via
shared oxygen atoms. The effect of the local atomic coordination on the band
gap, the electron effective mass, the orbital composition of the conduction
band, and the expected (an)isotropic character of the electron transport in
layered RAMO$_4$ is thoroughly discussed.

generally have a freedom in the choice of units, where different choices
correspond to different physical systems that are described by the same
equations. Since there are three basic physical units, of mass, length and
time, there are up to three free parameters in such a rescaling of the units,
$N_f \leq 3$. In Newtonian hydrodynamics, e.g., there are indeed usually three
free parameters, $N_f = 3$. If, however, the dynamical equations contain a
universal dimensional constant, such as the speed of light in vacuum $c$ or the
gravitational constant $G$, then the requirement that its value remains the
same imposes a constraint on the rescaling, which reduces its number of free
parameters by one, to $N_f = 2$. This is the case, for example, in
magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) or special relativistic hydrodynamics, where $c$
appears in the dynamical equations and forces the length and time units to
scale by the same factor, or in Newtonian gravity where the gravitational
constant $G$ appears in the equations. More generally, when there are $N_{udc}$
independent (in terms of their units) universal dimensional constants, then the
number of free parameters is $N_f = max(0,3-N_{udc})$. When both gravity and
relativity are included, there is only one free parameter ($N_f = 1$, as both
$G$ and $c$ appear in the equations so that $N_{udc} = 2$), and the units of
mass, length and time must all scale by the same factor. The explicit
rescalings for different types of systems are discussed and summarized here.
Such rescalings of the units also hold for discrete particles, e.g. in N-body
or particle in cell simulations. They are very useful when numerically
investigating a large parameter space or when attempting to fit particular
experimental results, by significantly reducing the required number of
simulations.

spreadsheets and the range and number of spreadsheets dealt with by individuals
on a daily basis. In so doing, this paper prompts important questions that can

with initially strong deviation from stoichiometric composition ({\delta}>0.06)
changes easily in both directions at temperatures Tp >=870 K, and the result of
the oxygen content variation can be well controlled via changes of conductivity
minimum temperature (Tm). The particularities of indirect accurate control of
the oxygen content in the film are described. The existence of oxygen-excessive

new generation of systems which can acquire knowledge via interaction with the

research which predominantly regarded linguistic phenomena as separated from
the brain and body. This could lead one into believing that to emulate
linguistic behaviour, it suffices to develop 'software' operating on abstract
representations that will work on any computational machine. This picture is
inaccurate for several reasons, which are elucidated in this paper and extend
beyond sensorimotor and semantic resonance. Beginning with a review of
research, I list several heterogeneous arguments against disembodied language,
in an attempt to draw conclusions for developing embodied multisensory agents
which communicate verbally and non-verbally with their environment. Without
taking into account both the architecture of the human brain, and embodiment,
it is unrealistic to replicate accurately the processes which take place during
language acquisition, comprehension, production, or during non-linguistic
actions. While robots are far from isomorphic with humans, they could benefit
from strengthened associative connections in the optimization of their
processes and their reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and in
situated human-machine interaction. The concept of multisensory integration
should be extended to cover linguistic input and the complementary information
combined from temporally coincident sensory impressions.

random walk process in velocity space. For objects engaged in classical
non-relativistic velocities, this leads under asymmetric conditions to
acceleration processes that resemble the behavior of objects subject to
Newton's second law, and in three dimensional space, acceleration dependent on
an inverse square law emerges. Thus, a non-relativistic random walk would
appear to be capable of describing certain prominent features of classical
physics; however, this classical behavior appears to be able to take place only
for objects with mass exceeding a threshold value which we identify with the
Planck mass. Under these circumstances, stochastic space-time displacements
would be smaller than the Planck length and the Planck time so that such
classically behaved objects would be effectively localized. Lower mass objects
exhibit more rapid diffusion and less localization, and a relativistic random
walk would seem to be required of objects having masses comparable to and
smaller than the threshold mass value. Results suggest the possibility of an
intrinsic quantum-classical transition in the microgram mass range.
