terms are fully consistent with the partitioning of the underlying one-electron

a previously introduced double-atom scheme [Vanfleteren D. et al., J Chem Phys

corresponding partitioning of the Hartree-Fock energy. When the size of the

that testing can serve as a preprocessing step before learning. However, in
most machine learning applications, it is not possible to request for labels of
fictitious examples constructed by the algorithm. Instead, the dominant query
paradigm in applied machine learning, called active learning, is one where the
algorithm may query for labels, but only on points in a given polynomial-sized
(unlabeled) sample, drawn from some underlying distribution D. In this work, we
bring this well-studied model in learning to the domain of testing.
  We show that for a number of important properties, testing can still yield
substantial benefits in this setting. This includes testing unions of
intervals, testing linear separators, and testing various assumptions used in
semi-supervised learning. In addition to these specific results, we also
develop a general notion of the testing dimension of a given property with
respect to a given distribution. We show this dimension characterizes (up to
constant factors) the intrinsic number of label requests needed to test that
property. We develop such notions for both the active and passive testing
models. We then use these dimensions to prove a number of lower bounds,
including for linear separators and the class of dictator functions.
  Our results show that testing can be a powerful tool in realistic models for
learning, and further that active testing exhibits an interesting and rich
structure. Our work in addition brings together tools from a range of areas
including U-statistics, noise-sensitivity, self-correction, and spectral
analysis of random matrices, and develops new tools that may be of independent
interest.

trapped dipolar bosonic gases. For the homogeneous system, the condensate
depletion, the ground-state energy, the equation of state, and the speed of

we extend these results in order to study the properties of a dipolar Bose gas

the equations of motion for the general case of a triaxial trap, we analyze the
influence of quantum fluctuations on important properties of the gas, such as
the equilibrium configuration and the low-lying excitations in the case of a
cylinder-symmetric trap. In addition to the monopole and quadrupole oscillation
modes, we also discuss the radial quadrupole mode. We find that the latter
acquires a quantum correction exclusively due to the dipole-dipole interaction.
As a result, we identify the radial quadrupole as a reasonably accessible
source for the signature of dipolar many-body effects and stress the enhancing
character that dipolar interactions have for quantum fluctuations in the other

However, the equipartition law of energy fails at the very low temperature.
Therefore, the formalism of the entropic force should be modified while the
temperature of the holographic screen is very low. Considering the Debye
entropic gravity and following the strategy of Verlinde, we derive the modified
Newton's law of gravitation and the corresponding Friedmann equations which are
valid in all range of temperature. In the limit of strong gravitational field,
i.e. high temperature compared to Debye temperature, $T\gg T_D$, one recovers
the standard Newton's law and Friedmann equations. We also generalize our study

equations for all range of temperature. Some limits of the obtained results are

than the gamma-ray spectrum observed by Fermi/LAT. The constraints found are
related to the real redshifts by a simple linear relation, that has been used
to infer the unknown or uncertain distance of blazars. The sample is revised

determining when a complicated multifield model can be well approximated by a

focus on the mode interactions in the kinematical basis, starting with the case
of no sourcing and showing that there is a series of mode conservation laws
analogous to the conservation law for the adiabatic mode in single-field
inflation. We then treat the special case of a quadratic potential with
canonical kinetic terms, showing that it produces a series of mode sourcing
relations identical in form to that for the adiabatic mode. We build on this
result to show that the mode sourcing relations for general multifield
inflation are extension of this special case but contain higher-order covariant
derivatives of the potential and corrections from the field metric. In
parallel, we show how these interactions depend on the geometry of the
inflationary Lagrangian and on the kinematics of the associated field
trajectory. Finally, we consider how the mode interactions and effective number
of fields active during inflation are reflected in the spectra and introduce a
multifield consistency relation, as well as a multifield observable that can

absence of nesting in the normal state dispersion leads to the particle-hole

This is reflected in the coexisting DDW and DSC states though the latter is
characterized by the Bogoluibov quasi-particle bands- a characteristic feature

the equation to determine the chemical potential. We also calculate the

representing two competing orders as the former brings about a depletion of the
spectral weight available for pairing in the anti-nodal region of momentum
space. We also show the depletion of the spectral weight below Tc at energies
larger than the gap amplitude. This is an important hallmark of the strong
coupling superconductivity. Furthermore, the passage from normal state to the

remarkable properties of the conduction electrons in graphene. For instance,
the conical band structure of graphene at low energies is strongly reminiscent
of relativistic Dirac fermions. Also, due the low Fermi velocity of v_F =

electrons in graphene is qualitatively similar to Quantum Electrodynamics in a

address this challenge by introducing the concept of concatenated continuous
dynamical decoupling, which can overcome not only external magnetic noise but
also noise due to fluctuations in driving fields. We show theoretically that
this approach can achieve relaxation limited coherence times, and demonstrate

microwave background (CMB) power spectra. The band powers presented here cover
angular scales 2000 < ell < 9400 in frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and
220 GHz. At these frequencies and angular scales, a combination of the primary
CMB anisotropy, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, radio
galaxies, and cosmic infrared background (CIB) contributes to the signal. We
combine Planck and SPT data at 220 GHz to constrain the amplitude and shape of
the CIB power spectrum and find strong evidence for non-linear clustering. We
explore the SZ results using a variety of cosmological models for the CMB and
CIB anisotropies and find them to be robust with one exception: allowing for
spatial correlations between the thermal SZ effect and CIB significantly
degrades the SZ constraints. Neglecting this potential correlation, we find the
thermal SZ power at 150 GHz and ell = 3000 to be 3.65 +/- 0.69 muK^2, and set
an upper limit on the kinetic SZ power to be less than 2.8 muK^2 at 95%
confidence. When a correlation between the thermal SZ and CIB is allowed, we
constrain a linear combination of thermal and kinetic SZ power: D_{3000}^{tSZ}
+ 0.5 D_{3000}^{kSZ} = 4.60 +/- 0.63 muK^2, consistent with earlier
measurements. We use the measured thermal SZ power and an analytic, thermal SZ
model calibrated with simulations to determine sigma8 = 0.807 +/- 0.016.
Modeling uncertainties involving the astrophysics of the intracluster medium
rather than the statistical uncertainty in the measured band powers are the
dominant source of uncertainty on sigma8 . We also place an upper limit on the
kinetic SZ power produced by patchy reionization; a companion paper uses these
limits to constrain the reionization history of the Universe.

general definition of an abelian class field theory from a purely
group-theoretical and functorial point of view. This definition allows a
modeling of abelian extensions of a field inside more general objects than the
invariants of a discrete module over the absolute Galois group of the field.
The main objects serving as such models are cohomological Mackey functors as
they have enough structure to make several reduction theorems of classical
approaches work in this generalized setting and, as observed by Fesenko, they
even have enough structure to make Neukirch's approach to class field theories
via Frobenius lifts work. This approach is discussed in full detail and in its
most general setting, including the pro-P setting proposed by Neukirch. As an
application and justification of this generalization we describe Fesenko's
approach to class field theory of higher local fields of positive
characteristic, where the modeling of abelian extensions takes place inside the
cohomological Mackey functor formed by the Milnor-Par\v{s}in K-groups.
  The motivation for this work (which is the author's Diplom thesis) was the
attempt to understand what a class field theory is and to give a single-line
definition which captures certain common aspects of several instances of class
field theories. We do not claim to prove any new theorem here, but we think
that our general and uniform approach offers a point of view not discussed in
this form in the existing literature.

it has today in accelerating our large Universe. In that case, its presence can
modify the initial conditions and evolution of cosmological perturbations,
changing the known results already obtained in the literature concerning their

appealing candidate for dark energy, the cosmological constant, and evaluate
its influence on the evolution of cosmological perturbations during the
contracting phase of a bouncing model, which also contains a scalar field with
a potential allowing background solutions with pressure and energy density
satisfying p = w*rho, w being a constant. An initial adiabatic vacuum state can
be set at the end of domination by the cosmological constant, and an almost
scale invariant spectrum of perturbations is obtained for w~0, which is the
usual result for bouncing models. However, the presence of the cosmological
constant induces oscillations and a running towards a tiny red-tilted spectrum
for long wavelength perturbations.

scattering cross section. The UFG corresponds to a two-component Fermi gas in
the limit of short interaction range and large scattering length, and is
currently realized in ultracold-atom experiments via Feshbach resonances. While
easy to define, the UFG poses a challenging quantum many-body problem, as it
lacks any characteristic scale other than the density. As a consequence,
accurate quantitative predictions of the thermodynamic properties of the UFG
require Monte Carlo calculations. However, significant progress has also been
made with purely analytical methods. Notably, in 2005 Tan derived a set of
exact thermodynamic relations in which a universal quantity known as the
""contact"" C plays a crucial role. Recently, C has also been found to determine
the prefactor of the high- frequency power-law decay of correlators as well as
the right-hand-sides of shear- and bulk viscosity sum rules. The contact is
therefore a central piece of information on the UFG in equilibrium as well as
away from equilibrium. In this talk we describe some of the known aspects of

$M$ as $A W$ where $A$ and $W$ are nonnegative matrices of size $n \times r$
and $r \times m$ respectively. In some applications, it makes sense to ask
instead for the product $AW$ to approximate $M$ -- i.e. (approximately)
minimize $\norm{M - AW}_F$ where $\norm{}_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm; we
refer to this as Approximate NMF. This problem has a rich history spanning
quantum mechanics, probability theory, data analysis, polyhedral combinatorics,
communication complexity, demography, chemometrics, etc. In the past decade NMF
has become enormously popular in machine learning, where $A$ and $W$ are
computed using a variety of local search heuristics. Vavasis proved that this
problem is NP-complete. We initiate a study of when this problem is solvable in
polynomial time:
  1. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for exact and approximate NMF for
every constant $r$. Indeed NMF is most interesting in applications precisely
when $r$ is small.
  2. We complement this with a hardness result, that if exact NMF can be solved
in time $(nm)^{o(r)}$, 3-SAT has a sub-exponential time algorithm. This rules
out substantial improvements to the above algorithm.
  3. We give an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $n$, $m$ and $r$
under the separablity condition identified by Donoho and Stodden in 2003. The
algorithm may be practical since it is simple and noise tolerant (under benign
assumptions). Separability is believed to hold in many practical settings.
  To the best of our knowledge, this last result is the first example of a
polynomial-time algorithm that provably works under a non-trivial condition on
the input and we believe that this will be an interesting and important
direction for future work.

spatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of

designed to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the following
quantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas:
distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematic
properties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. CALIFA uses the PPAK
Integral Field Unit (IFU), with a hexagonal field-of-view of
$\sim1.3\sq\arcmin'$, with a 100% covering factor by adopting a three-pointing
dithering scheme. The optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000
{\AA}, using two overlapping setups (V500 and V1200), with different
resolutions: R\sim850 and R\sim1650, respectively. CALIFA is a legacy survey,
intended for the community. The reduced data will be released, once the quality
has been guaranteed. The analyzed data fulfill the expectations of the original
observing proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratory

follows: \[ \phi(S) \defeq \frac{w(S,\bar{S})}{\min \set{w(S), w(\bar{S})}}

cut and $\lambda_2$ is the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized
Laplacian of the graph. Here we prove the following natural generalization: for
any integer $k \in [n]$, there exist $ck$ disjoint subsets $S_1, ..., S_{ck}$,
such that \[ \max_i \phi(S_i) \leq C \sqrt{\lambda_{k} \log k} \] where
$\lambda_i$ is the $i^{th}$ smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian and
$c<1,C>0$ are suitable absolute constants. Our proof is via a polynomial-time
algorithm to find such subsets, consisting of a spectral projection and a
randomized rounding. As a consequence, we get the same upper bound for the
small set expansion problem, namely for any $k$, there is a subset $S$ whose
weight is at most a $\bigO(1/k)$ fraction of the total weight and $\phi(S) \le
C \sqrt{\lambda_k \log k}$. Both results are the best possible up to constant
factors.
  The underlying algorithmic problem, namely finding $k$ subsets such that the
maximum expansion is minimized, besides extending sparse cuts to more than one
subset, appears to be a natural clustering problem in its own right.

primary contributes to the early SN brightness and, since this radiation energy
is degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity depends
on the initial primary radius. We present a new non-detection limit of the
nearby SN Ia 2011fe, obtained what appears to be just 4 hours after explosion,
allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius, R_p. Coupled with
the non-detection of a quiescent X-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesized
Ni mass, we show that R_p <~ 0.02 R_sun (a factor of 5 smaller than previously
inferred), that the average density of the primary must be rho_p > 10,000 gm
cm^{-3}, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few x 10^5 K.
This rules out hydrogen burning main sequence stars and giants. Constructing
the helium-burning main sequence and carbon-burning main sequence, we find such

ago to be a very low-mass spectroscopic binary. Determination of its mass would
provide a valuable dynamical mass measurement at young ages in the poorly

(RV) monitoring with UVES/VLT between 2008 and 2011 and high-resolution
adaptive optic assisted imaging with NACO/VLT in 2008 with the aim to constrain
the binary orbit. We present an orbital solution of the system based on the
combined RV data set which spans more than 11 years of UVES monitoring for
CHXR74. The best-fit Kepler model has an orbital period of 13.1 yrs, zero
eccentricity, and a RV semi-amplitude of 2.2 km/s. A companion mass M2sini of
0.08 Msun is derived by using a model-dependent mass estimate for the primary
of 0.24 Msun. The binary separation for i=90deg is 3.8 AU (23 mas).
Complementary NACO images of CHXR74 were taken with the aim to directly resolve
the binary. While there are marginal signs of an extended PSF, we have no
convincing companion detected to CHXR74 in these images. From the non-detection
of the companion together with a prediction of the binary separation at the
time of the NACO observations, we derive an upper limit for the K-band
brightness ratio of 0.5. This allows us to estimate an upper limit of the
companion mass of 0.14 Msun by applying evolutionary models. Thus, we have
confirmed that CHXR74 is a very low-mass spectroscopic binary and constrained
the secondary mass to lie within the range of about 0.08 and 0.14 Msun. We
predict an astrometric signal of the primary between 0.2 and 0.4 mas when
taking into account the luminosity of the companion. The GAIA astrometric
mission might well be able to solve the astrometric orbit of the primary and in
combination with the presented RV data to determine an absolute companion mass.

disc galaxies, using a volume-limited catalogue of 15810 galaxies at z<0.06
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with visual morphologies from the Galaxy Zoo
2 project. We find that the likelihood of having a bar, or bulge, in disc
galaxies increases when the galaxies have redder (optical) colours and larger
stellar masses, and observe a transition in the bar and bulge likelihoods, such
that massive disc galaxies are more likely to host bars and bulges. We use
galaxy clustering methods to demonstrate statistically significant
environmental correlations of barred, and bulge-dominated, galaxies, from
projected separations of 150 kpc/h to 3 Mpc/h. These environmental correlations
appear to be independent of each other: i.e., bulge-dominated disc galaxies
exhibit a significant bar-environment correlation, and barred disc galaxies
show a bulge-environment correlation. We demonstrate that approximately half
(50 +/- 10%) of the bar-environment correlation can be explained by the fact
that more massive dark matter haloes host redder disc galaxies, which are then
more likely to have bars. Likewise, we show that the environmental dependence
of stellar mass can only explain a small fraction (25 +/- 10%) of the
bar-environment correlation. Therefore, a significant fraction of our observed
environmental dependence of barred galaxies is not due to colour or stellar
mass dependences, and hence could be due to another galaxy property. Finally,
by analyzing the projected clustering of barred and unbarred disc galaxies with
halo occupation models, we argue that barred galaxies are in slightly
higher-mass haloes than unbarred ones, and some of them (approximately 25%) are
satellite galaxies in groups. We also discuss implications about the effects of
minor mergers and interactions on bar formation.

akin to observed engine-driven SNe such as SN2009bb. Engines with intermediate
durations produce weak gamma-ray bursts, with properties similar to nearby
bursts such as GRB 980425. Finally, we find that the engines with the shortest
durations, if they exist in nature, produce stellar explosions that lack
sizable amounts of relativistic ejecta and are therefore dynamically
indistinguishable from ordinary core-collapse supernovae.

fluctuations on the RM statistical properties; the average RM and the RM
standard deviation are increased by the action of the jets. This may lead to
overestimations of the CMFs' strength up to 70%. The effect correlates with the
jet power. Jets distort and amplify CMFs especially near the edges of the lobes
and the jets' heads. Thus the RM structure functions are flattened at scales
comparable to the source size. Jet-produced RM enhancements depend on the
orientation of the jet axis to the line of sight and are thus more apparent in
quasars than in radio galaxies.

massive Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Using a combination of simple surface
density plots and a more sophisticated angular cross-correlation function
analysis we show that there is a statistically significant overdensity of RMS
YSOs towards the bubbles. There is a clear peak in the surface density and
angular cross-correlation function of YSOs projected against the rim of the
bubbles. By investigating the autocorrelation function of the RMS YSOs we show
that this is not due to intrinsic clustering of the RMS YSO sample. RMS YSOs
and Spitzer bubbles are essentially uncorrelated with each other beyond a
normalised angular distance of two bubble radii. The bubbles associated with
RMS YSOs tend to be both smaller and thinner than those that are not associated
with YSOs. We interpret this tendency to be due to an age effect, with YSOs
being preferentially found around smaller and younger bubbles. We find no
evidence to suggest that the YSOs associated with the bubbles are any more
luminous than the rest of the RMS YSO population, which suggests that the
triggering process does not produce a top heavy luminosity function or initial
mass function. We suggest that it is likely that the YSOs were triggered by the
expansion of the bubbles and estimate that the fraction of massive stars in the
Milky Way formed by this process could be between 14 and 30%.

are known to produce correct results in the case of Einstein's theory and
generalize them to Lanczos-Lovelock models. In the first approach (which could
be called extrinsic) we use a procedure motivated by earlier work by Pretorius,
Vollick and Israel, and by Oppenheim, and evaluate the entropy of a
configuration of densely packed gravitating shells on the verge of forming a
black hole in Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity. We find that this matter
entropy is not equal to (it is less than) Wald entropy, except in the case of
Einstein theory, where they are equal. The matter entropy is proportional to
the Wald entropy if we consider a specific m-th order Lanczos-Lovelock model,
with the proportionality constant depending on the spacetime dimensions D and
the order m of the Lanczos-Lovelock theory as (D-2m)/(D-2). Since the
proportionality constant depends on m, the proportionality between matter
entropy and Wald entropy breaks down when we consider a sum of Lanczos-Lovelock
actions involving different m. In the second approach (which could be called
intrinsic) we generalize a procedure, previously introduced by Padmanabhan in
the context of GR, to study off-shell entropy of a class of metrics with
horizon using a path integral method. We consider the Euclidean action of
Lanczos-Lovelock models for a class of metrics off-shell and interpret it as a
partition function. We show that in the case of spherically symmetric metrics,
one can interpret the Euclidean action as the free energy and read off both the
entropy and energy of a black hole spacetime. Surprisingly enough, this leads
to exactly the Wald entropy and the energy of the spacetime in Lanczos-Lovelock
models obtained by other methods. We comment on possible implications of the
result.

quantum physics to allow two distant parties to share a secret key; however,
QKD is hampered by a distance limitation of a few hundred kilometers on earth.
The most immediate solution for global coverage is to use a satellite, which
can receive separate QKD transmissions from two or more ground stations and act
as a trusted node to link these ground stations. In this article, we report a
system capable of performing QKD in the high loss regime expected in an uplink
to a satellite using weak coherent pulses and decoy states. Such a scenario
profits from the simplicity of its receiver payload, but has so far considered
to be infeasible due to very high transmission losses (40 - 50 dB). The high
loss is overcome by implementing an innovative photon source and advanced
timing analysis. Our system handles up to 57 dB photon loss in the infinite key
limit, confirming the viability of the satellite uplink scenario. We emphasize
that while this system was designed with a satellite uplink in mind, it could
just as easily overcome high losses on any free space QKD link.

and the occurrence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in disk galaxies. Giant
clumps of 10^8-9 Msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-rich
galaxies, and it has been proposed that this instability could feed
supermassive black holes (BH). We use emission line diagnostics to compare a
sample of 14 clumpy (unstable) disks and a sample of 13 smoother (stable) disks
at redshift z~0.7. The majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a high
probability of containing AGN. Their [OIII] emission line is strongly excited,
inconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone. [NeIII] excitation is
also higher. Stable disks rarely have such properties. Stacking ultra sensitive
Chandra observations (4 Ms) reveals an X-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, which
cannot be solely due to star formation and confirms the presence of AGN. The
clumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical of
gas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the Main
Sequence of star formation. This suggests that our findings apply to the
physically-similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z>1. Using the
observed [OIII] and X-ray luminosities, we conservatively estimate that AGN
hosted by clumpy disks have typical bolometric luminosities of the order of a
few 10^43 erg/s, BH growth rates ~10^-2 Msun/yr, and that these AGN are
substantially obscured in X-rays. This moderate-luminosity mode could be
sufficient to provide a large fraction of today's BH mass over a couple of Gyr
given that our observations suggest a high duty cycle (>10%), accretion bursts
with higher luminosities being possible over shorter phases. The observed
evolution of disk instabilities with mass and redshift could explain the
simultaneous downsizing of star formation and of BH growth.

is affected by all the mass content along the line-of-sight. Using COSMOS shear
mock data we study the shear profile of 165 groups and investigate the level at
which the neighbouring groups can enhance or suppress the shear signal from the
main halo. Our mock data are based on CFHT and Subaru observations and the
information on the galaxy groups is taken from the COSMOS X-ray catalogue of
extended sources. The expected gravitational shear field of these groups is
calculated assuming that the haloes follow NFW density profiles. We conclude
that, on average, the signal-to-noise for a detection of the main halo is
affected by ~15%x\sqrt{ngal/30} with respect to the signal-to-noise the same
halo would have if it was isolated in the sky. Groups with neighbours that are
close in projected distance (<1') are the most affected, but haloes located at
larger angular distances also cause a measurable shear signal, which can be
interpreted as uncorrelated large-scale structure. The average bias in the mass
excess estimate of individual groups that is introduced by the external haloes
is zero with an rms of ~6-72%, depending on the aperture size used. The shear
signal introduced by large-scale structure acts as an external source of noise.
The averaged uncertainty introduced is \sigma_{\gamma_t}^{LSS}~0.006 per
component for an aperture size of ~5', which corresponds to 1.8% of the
one-component intrinsic ellipticity value. This large-scale structure noise
error becomes equal to intrinsic ellipticity noise if there are measurements
for ~3000 galaxies within a certain aperture, a number that is already achieved
by current deep surveys such as COSMOS and, therefore, should not be ignored.

The equations of motion of the
stars in the cluster are solved by direct N-body integration while taking the
effects of stellar evolution and the hydrodynamics of the natal gas content
into account. The gravity of the stars and the surrounding gas are coupled self
consistently to allow the realistic dynamical evolution of the cluster. While
the equations of motion are solved, a stellar evolution code keeps track of the
changes in stellar mass, luminosity and radius. The gas liberated by the
stellar winds and supernovae deposits mass and energy into the gas reservoir in
which the cluster is embedded. We examine cluster models with 1000 stars, but
we varied the star formation efficiency (between 0.05-0.5), cluster radius
(0.1-1.0 parsec), the degree of virial support of the initial population of
stars (0-100%) and the strength of the feedback. We find that an initial star
fraction $M_\star/M_{\rm tot} > 0.05$ is necessary for cluster survival.
Survival is more likely if gas is not blown out violently by a supernova and if
the cluster has time to approach virial equilibrium during out-gassing. While
the cluster is embedded, dynamical friction drives early and efficient mass
segregation in the cluster. Stars of $m \gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$ are preferentially
retained, at the cost of the loss of less massive stars. We conclude that the
degree of mass segregation in open clusters such as the Pleiades is not the
result of secular evolution but a remnant of its embedded stage.

superluminality with such an accuracy. We observe that these bounds rely

deformation, but provide rather weak bounds, which in particular for electron
superluminality we establish to afford us no more constraining power than for

bases for computing with kernels. In particular, we are interested in
constructing families $(b_{\xi})_{\xi\in\Xi}$ that function as bases for kernel
spaces $S(k,\Xi)$ so that each basis function is constructed using very few
kernels. In other words, each function $b_{\zeta}(x) = \sum_{\xi\in\Xi}
A_{\zeta,\xi} k(x,\xi)$ is a linear combination of samples of the kernel with
few nonzero coefficients $A_{\zeta,\xi}$. This is reminiscent of the
construction of the B-spline basis from the family of truncated power
functions.
  We demonstrate that for a large class of kernels (the Sobolev kernels as well
as many kernels of polyharmonic and related type) such bases exist. In fact,
the basis elements can be constructed using a combination of roughly $O(\log
N)^d$ kernels, where $d$ is the local dimension of the manifold and $N$ is the
dimension of the kernel space (i.e. $N=#\Xi$). Viewing this as a preprocessing
step -- the construction of the basis has computational cost $O(N(\log N)^d)$.
Furthermore, we prove that the new basis is $L_p$ stable and satisfies
polynomial decay estimates that are stationary with respect to the density of
$\Xi$.

long pulse period of 5.3 hr is directly visible in the 2008 INTEGRAL-ISGRI
outburst light curve. The pulse profile is double peaked and generally not
significantly energy dependent although there is an indication of possible
softening during the main pulse. During the outburst a strong spin-up of -1.8

message-passing algorithm for computing marginal distributions in graphical
models with discrete variables. At the core of the BP message updates, when
applied to a graphical model with pairwise interactions, lies a matrix-vector
product with complexity that is quadratic in the state dimension $d$, and
requires transmission of a $(d-1)$-dimensional vector of real numbers
(messages) to its neighbors. Since various applications involve very large
state dimensions, such computation and communication complexities can be
prohibitively complex. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity variant of
BP, referred to as stochastic belief propagation (SBP). As suggested by the
name, it is an adaptively randomized version of the BP message updates in which
each node passes randomly chosen information to each of its neighbors. The SBP
message updates reduce the computational complexity (per iteration) from
quadratic to linear in $d$, without assuming any particular structure of the
potentials, and also reduce the communication complexity significantly,
requiring only $\log{d}$ bits transmission per edge. Moreover, we establish a
number of theoretical guarantees for the performance of SBP, showing that it
converges almost surely to the BP fixed point for any tree-structured graph,
and for graphs with cycles satisfying a contractivity condition. In addition,
for these graphical models, we provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the
convergence rate, showing that the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm of the error vector
decays no slower than $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ with the number of iterations $t$ on
trees and the mean square error decays as $O(1/t)$ for general graphs. These
analysis show that SBP can provably yield reductions in computational and
communication complexities for various classes of graphical models.

the interference phase can be inferred from the particle number registered at
one detector by using the classical mean fields. If the conditional number
distributions for the other detectors, given the outcome of the first detector,
exhibit sufficiently narrow peaks around the values specified by the estimated
phases, the mean field description is valid in a single run of interference.
The widths in the conditional distribution are determined by the number
statistics of the sources, among which notable scaling behavior is found
depending on the detector configurations with the boundary at the Poissonian.
The mean field description is found to be applicable to Poissonian and
sub-Poissonian sources, whereas for super-Poissonian sources it is likely

undersampling is important both for theory and practice. We present a formula
that characterizes the allowed undersampling of generalized sparse objects. The
formula applies to Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms for compressed
sensing, which are here generalized to employ denoising operators besides the
traditional scalar soft thresholding denoiser. This paper gives several
examples including scalar denoisers not derived from convex penalization -- the
firm shrinkage nonlinearity and the minimax nonlinearity -- and also nonscalar
denoisers -- block thresholding, monotone regression, and total variation
minimization.
  Let the variables eps = k/N and delta = n/N denote the generalized sparsity
and undersampling fractions for sampling the k-generalized-sparse N-vector x_0
according to y=Ax_0. Here A is an n\times N measurement matrix whose entries
are iid standard Gaussian. The formula states that the phase transition curve
delta = delta(eps) separating successful from unsuccessful reconstruction of
x_0 by AMP is given by: delta = M(eps| Denoiser), where M(eps| Denoiser)
denotes the per-coordinate minimax mean squared error (MSE) of the specified,
optimally-tuned denoiser in the directly observed problem y = x + z. In short,
the phase transition of a noiseless undersampling problem is identical to the
minimax MSE in a denoising problem.

indicate that motors along a single microtubule protofilament can generate

found to be the convex hull of the union of n power control rate regions, where
each power control rate region is upperbounded by a (n-1)-dimensional
hyper-surface characterized by having one of the transmitters transmitting at
full power. The convex hull operation lends itself to a time-sharing operation

when to use time-sharing rather than power control, the paper studies the
hyper-surfaces convexity behavior in details for the 2-user channel with
specific results pertaining to the symmetric channel. It is observed that most
of the achievable rate region can be covered by using simple On/Off binary
power control in conjunction with time-sharing. The binary power control
creates several corner points in the n-dimensional space. The crystallized rate
region, named after its resulting crystal shape, is hence presented as the
time-sharing convex hull imposed onto those corner points; thereby offering a
viable new perspective of looking at the achievable rate region of the

for target degrees of freedom (DoF) in interfering broadcast channels (IBC)
consisting of K-transmitters and their user groups. First, each transmitter is
assumed to have a single antenna and serve a singe user in its user group where
each user has receive antennas less than K. In this case, a K-transmitter
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) interference channel (IC) is constituted
after user selection. Without help of multiuser diversity, K-1 interfering
signals cannot be perfectly removed at each user since the number of receive
antennas is smaller than or equal to the number of interferers. Only with
proper user selection, non-zero DoF per transmitter is achievable as the number
of users increases. Through geometric interpretation of interfering channels,
we show that the multiuser dimensions have to be used first for reducing the
DoF loss caused by the interfering signals, and then have to be used for
increasing the DoF gain from its own signal. The sufficient number of users for
the target DoF is derived. We also discuss how the optimal strategy of
exploiting multiuser diversity can be realized by practical user selection
schemes. Finally, the single transmit antenna case is extended to the
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) IBC where each transmitter with multiple
antennas serves multiple users.

sensors with a limited energy supply is considered. Since the conventional
chemical sensors in active mode consume vast amounts of energy, an optimisation
problem arises in the context of a balance between the energy consumption and
the detection capabilities of such a network. A protocol based on ""dynamic
sensor collaboration"" is employed: in the absence of any pollutant, majority of
sensors are in the sleep (passive) mode; a sensor is invoked (activated) by
wake-up messages from its neighbors only when more information is required. The
paper proposes a mathematical model of a network of chemical sensors using this
protocol. The model provides valuable insights into the network behavior and
near optimal capacity design (energy consumption against detection). An
analytical model of the environment, using turbulent mixing to capture chaotic
fluctuations, intermittency and non-homogeneity of the pollutant distribution,
is employed in the study. A binary model of a chemical sensor is assumed (a
device with threshold detection). The outcome of the study is a set of simple
analytical tools for sensor network design, optimisation, and performance
analysis.

components in an undirected graph is equal to the multiplicity of the
eigenvalue zero in the Laplacian matrix of the graph. In particular, the graph
is disconnected if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues equal to
zero. Cheeger's inequality and its variants provide an approximate version of
the latter fact; they state that a graph has a sparse cut if and only if there
are at least two eigenvalues that are close to zero.
  It has been conjectured that an analogous characterization holds for higher
multiplicities, i.e., there are $k$ eigenvalues close to zero if and only if
the vertex set can be partitioned into $k$ subsets, each defining a sparse cut.
We resolve this conjecture. Our result provides a theoretical justification for
clustering algorithms that use the bottom $k$ eigenvectors to embed the
vertices into $\mathbb R^k$, and then apply geometric considerations to the
embedding.
  We also show that these techniques yield a nearly optimal tradeoff between
the expansion of sets of size $\approx n/k$, and the $k$th smallest eigenvalue
of the normalized Laplacian matrix, denoted $\lambda_k$. In particular, we show
that in every graph there is a set of size at most $2n/k$ which has expansion
at most $O(\sqrt{\lambda_k \log k})$. This bound is tight, up to constant

in the oscillation probability lead to a novel seasonal variation of detected

propose two models that predict such a detectable monochromatic neutrino flux
from the DM annihilation. Model I, which is based on augmenting the type II
seesaw mechanism, predicts a flavor composition for the monochromatic flux
determined by $(m_\nu)_{\alpha \beta}$. In model II, the DM pair first
annihilates to a pair of sterile neutrinos which oscillate into active
neutrinos with a flavor composition determined by the flavor structure of the
active-sterile neutrino mixing.

be that dust is continuously generated by larger bodies in the midplane and
transported to the surface of the disks. In general, in a first step of this
scenario, the larger bodies have to be destroyed again and different mechanisms
exist with the potential to accomplish this. Possible destructive mechanisms
are fragmentation in collisions, erosion by gas drag or light induced erosion.
In laboratory experiments we find that the latter, light induced erosion by
Knudsen compression and photophoresis, can provide small particles. It might be
a preferred candidate as the dust is released into a low particle density
region. The working principle of this mechanism prevents or decreases the
likelihood for instant re-accretion or re-growth of large dense aggregates.
Provided that there is a particle lift, e.g. turbulence, these particles might
readily reach the surface of the disk.

satellites and reveals the surface of these new worlds. The shape and rotation
of the satellites can be determined from the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem
data, employing limb coordinates and stereogrammetric control points. This is
the case for Epimetheus (Tiscareno et al. 2009) that opens elaboration of new
rotational models (Tiscareno et al. 2009; Noyelles 2010; Robutel et al. 2011).
Especially, Epimetheus is characterized by its horseshoe shape orbit and the
presence of the swap is essential to introduce explicitly into rotational
models. During its journey in the saturnian system, Cassini spacecraft
accumulates the observational data of the other satellites and it will be
possible to determine the rotational parameters of several of them. To prepare
these future observations, we built rotational models of the coorbital (also
called Trojan) satellites Telesto, Calypso, Helene, and Polydeuces, in addition
to Janus and Epimetheus. Indeed, Telesto and Calypso orbit around the L_4 and
L_5 Lagrange points of Saturn-Tethys while Helene and Polydeuces are coorbital
of Dione. The goal of this study is to understand how the departure from the
Keplerian motion induced by the perturbations of the coorbital body, influences
the rotation of these satellites. To this aim, we introduce explicitly the
perturbation in the rotational equations by using the formalism developed by
Erdi (1977) to represent the coorbital motions, and so we describe the
rotational motion of the coorbitals, Janus and Epimetheus included, in compact
form.

transition. It is not the case, however. Being the second order at ambient

  Valley, Lake Tahoe, California",,,,"hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the chiral phase transition at finite temperature (T) in
colour SU(3) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with six species of fermions (Nf = 6)
in the fundamental representation. The simulations have been performed by using
lattice QCD with improved staggered fermions. The critical couplings (bc) for
the chiral phase transition are observed for several temporal extensions Nt,
and the two-loop asymptotic scaling of the dimensionless ratio Tc/Lambda_L
(Lambda_L = Lattice Lambda-parameter) is found to be achieved for Nt >= 6.
Further, we collect bc at Nf = 0 (quenched), and Nf = 4 at a fixed Nt = 6 as
well as Nf = 8 at Nt = 6 and 12, the latter relying on our earlier study. The
results are consistent with enhanced fermionic screening at larger Nf. The
ratio Tc/Lambda_L depends very mildly on Nf in the Nf = 0-4 region, begins
increasing at Nf = 6, and significantly grows up at Nf = 8, as Nf reaches to
the edge of the conformal window. We discuss the interrelation of the results
with preconformal dynamics in the light of a functional renormalization group
analysis.

one case this relaxation is very efficient with current sheets filling the
volume and homogeneous heating of the loop occurring. In the other case fewer

patchy heating of the loop results. The two cases, although very similar in

non-Gaussianity in the regime of low squeezing, for a subclass of
continuous-variable Werner states. We further study an example of a
non-Gaussian state which is positive under partial transposition, and whose
nonclassical correlations stay finite and small even for infinite squeezing.

of the time-evolving probability density function of the location of the search

operational oceanic and atmospheric forecast system of The Norwegian

for the first time high-resolution wind and current fields to be used to

observed trajectories for liferafts and other search objects. Comparison with

  to Finance and Stochastics",,,,"q-fin.RM q-fin.CP q-fin.PM q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The benefits of diversifying risks are difficult to estimate quantitatively
because of the uncertainties in the dependence structure between the risks.
Also, the modelling of multidimensional dependencies is a non-trivial task.
This paper focuses on one such technique for portfolio aggregation, namely the
aggregation of risks within trees, where dependencies are set at each step of
the aggregation with the help of some copulas. We define rigorously this
procedure and then study extensively the Gaussian Tree of quite arbitrary size
and shape, where individual risks are normal, and where the Gaussian copula is
used. We derive exact analytical results for the diversification benefit of the
Gaussian tree as a function of its shape and of the dependency parameters.
  Such a ""toy-model"" of an aggregation tree enables one to understand the basic
phenomena's at play while aggregating risks in this way. In particular, it is
shown that, for a fixed number of individual risks, ""thin"" trees diversify
better than ""fat"" trees. Related to this, it is shown that hierarchical trees
have the natural tendency to lower the overall dependency with respect to the
dependency parameter chosen at each step of the aggregation. We also show that
these results hold in more general cases outside the gaussian world, and apply
notably to more realistic portfolios (LogNormal trees). We believe that any
insurer or reinsurer using such a tool should be aware of these systematic
effects, and that this awareness should strongly call for designing trees that
adequately fit the business.
  We finally address the issue of specifying the full joint distribution
between the risks. We show that the hierarchical mechanism does not require nor
specify the joint distribution, but that the latter can be determined exactly
(in the Gaussian case) by adding conditional independence hypotheses between
the risks and their sums.

a spherical symmetry. Over the last decades the geophysical observations have
revealed, at different spatial scales, the existence of several perturbations
from this basic structure. Some of them are situated in the neighborhood of the
inner core boundary (ICB). One of the best documented perturbations is the
asymmetry at the top of the inner core (ATIC) characterized by faster seismic
wave velocity in the eastern hemisphere than in the western hemisphere. All
existing explanations are based on a hemispheric variation of the material
properties near ICB inside the inner core. Using numerical simulations of the
seismic ray propagation, we show that the ATIC can be explained as well by the
displacement of the inner core towards east in the equatorial plane tens of
kilometers from the Earth's center, without modifying the spherical symmetry in
the upper inner core. The hypothesis of a displaced inner core is also
sustained by other observed hemispheric asymmetries at the top of the inner
core and at the bottom of the outer core. A displaced inner core would have
major implications for many mechanical, thermal, and magnetic phenomena in the
Earth's interior.

stars clearly show periodic variability that we assign to rotation of the

the range 0.31 < P_rot < 126.5 d. A considerable number of stars with rotation
periods similar to the solar value show activity levels that are 100 times
higher than the Sun. This is consistent with results for solar-like field
stars. As has been found in previous studies, stars with shorter rotation

by introducing the Abbott-Deser (AD) method for defining Killing charges in

to be modified at short-distance nuclear scales, using instead a nonminimally
coupled scalar-tensor theory of gravitation that provides for the existence of
QCD's two-phase vacuum having two different zero-point energy states as a
function of temperature. Einstein gravity alone cannot accomplish this. The
scalar field will be taken from bag theory in hadron physics, and the origin of
the bag constant B is accounted for by gravity's cosmological constant - noting
that the Higgs mechanism does not account for either the curved-space origin of
lambda or the mass of composite hadrons. A small Hubble-scale graviton mass
naturally appears external to the hadron bag, induced by lambda. This mass is
unobservable and gravitationally gauge-dependent. It is shown to be related to
the cosmological event horizon in asmyptotic de Sitter space.

layered structure of species deposited onto the surface of grains during the
lifetime of a protoplanetary disk. The history of trapping important quantities
of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules onto the grains is of special
significance for the formation of more complex (organic) molecules on the
surface of grains. Aims. Among other processes, cosmic ray-induced UV
photo-processes can lead to the efficient formation of OH. Using a more
accurate treatment of cosmic ray-gas interactions for disks, we obtain an
increased cosmic ray-induced UV photon flux of 3.8x10^5 photons cm^-2s^-1 for a
cosmic-ray ionization rate of H2 value of 5x10^-17 s^-1 (compared to previous
estimates of 10^4 photons cm^-2s^-1 based on ISM dust properties). We explore
the role of the enhanced OH abundance on the gas-grain chemistry in the
midplane of the disk at 10 AU, which is a plausible location for comet
formation. We focus on studying the formation/destruction pathways and
timescales of the dominant chemical species. Methods. We solve the chemical
rate equations based on a gas-grain chemical network and correcting for the
enhanced cosmic rayinduced UV field. This field is estimated from an
appropriate treatment of dust properties in a protoplanetary disk, as opposed
to previous estimates that assume an ISM-like grain size distribution. We also
explore the chemical effects of photo-desorption of water ice into OH+H.
Results. Near the end of the disk's lifetime our chemical model yields H2O, CO,
CO2 and CH4 ice abundances at 10 AU (consistent with a midplane density of
10^10 cm^-3 and a temperature of 20 K) that are compatible with measurements of
the chemical composition of cometary bodies for a [C/O] ratio of 0.16. Such
comparison provides constraints on the physical conditions in which comets were
formed.

degenerate Bose gas. It is shown that their huge quantum degeneracy and large
correlation length cause cold dark matter axions to thermalize through
gravitational self-interactions when the photon temperature reaches
approximately 500 eV. When they thermalize, the axions form a Bose-Einstein
condensate. Their thermalization occurs in a regime, herein called the
`condensed regime', where the Boltzmann equation is not valid because the
energy dispersion of the particles is smaller than their interaction rate. We
derive analytical expressions for the thermalization rate of particles in the
condensed regime, and check the validity of these expressions by numerical
simulation of a toy model. We revisit axion cosmology in light of axion
Bose-Einstein condensation. It is shown that axions are indistinguishable from
ordinary cold dark matter on all scales of observational interest, except when
they thermalize or rethermalize. The rethermalization of axions that are about
to fall in a galactic potential well causes them to acquire net overall
rotation as they go to the lowest energy state consistent with the total
angular momentum they acquired by tidal torquing. This phenomenon explains the
occurrence of caustic rings of dark matter in galactic halos. We find that
photons may reach thermal contact with axions and investigate the implications

cardinality of the support of a particular solution of the Lasso problem is an
unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom. This is achieved without the need

We similarly find that the dSph data are consistent with the relation between
{\rho}0 and baryon scale length seen in spiral galaxies. While the origin of
these scaling relations is unclear, the finding that a single DM halo profile
is consistent with kinematic data in galaxies of widely varying size,
luminosity and Hubble Type is important for our understanding of observed
galaxies and must be accounted for in models of galaxy formation.

(Dirac matrices) on the square lattice interact via anisotropic
nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. The model is
exactly solved by mapping it onto a tight-binding model of free Majorana
fermions coupled with static Z_2 gauge fields. The Majorana fermion model can
be viewed as a model of time-reversal invariant superconductor and is
classified as a member of symmetry class DIII in the Altland-Zirnbauer
classification. The ground-state phase diagram has two topologically distinct
gapped phases which are distinguished by a Z_2 topological invariant. The
topologically nontrivial phase supports both a Kramers' pair of gapless
Majorana edge modes at the boundary and a Kramers' pair of zero-energy Majorana
states bound to a 0-flux vortex in the \pi-flux background. Power-law decaying
correlation functions of spins along the edge are obtained by taking the
gapless Majorana edge modes into account. The model is also defined on the
one-dimension ladder, in which case again the ground-state phase diagram has
Z_2 trivial and non-trivial phases.

decreasing year-by-year. The fossil fuel is considered insufficient thus solar
energy systems are becoming more and more useful, not only in terms of
installation but monitoring of these systems is very crucial. Monitoring
becomes very important when there are a large number of solar panels.
Monitoring would allow early detection if the output falls below required level
or one of the solar panel out of 1000 goes down. In this study the target is to
monitor and control a developed solar panel by using available internet
foundation. This web-enabled software will provide more flexibility over the
system such as transmitting data from panel to the host computer and
disseminating information to relevant stake holders barring any geographical
barrier. The software would be built around web server with dynamic HTML and
JAVA, this paper presents the preliminary design of the proposed system.

asymmetry in the B meson system measured at the Tevatron. The noncontractible
space, as an alternative symmetry-breaking mechanism to the Higgs mechanism,
can change standard field theoretic calculations of the physical processes
mediated through quantum loops for large external momenta or large internal
masses. The presence of the W bosons and t-quarks in loops of the B meson
mixing can enhance the corresponding semileptonic CP asymmetry when the loop
integration is up to the universal Lorentz and gauge invariant UV cut-off. We
show that the enhancement is roughly 13%, thus the possible deviation is
measurable at the Tevatron, LHCb, SuperKEKB and SuperB facilities.

described with quantum loop diagrams containing also heavy particles. We show
that the electroweak theory with the noncontractible space, as a

Standard Model prediction of the branching ratio of the B_s meson decaying to
two muons. The branching ratio is lower by more than 30% compared with the

implications on the selection of the symmetry-breaking mechanism could be
decisive.

significant challenge to the special theory of relativity and needs to be
addressed either as a source of new physics, or as an un-remedied experimental
error. There have been several attempts at using new physics to explain the
results, while a few unpublished results exist that address the experimental
errors that might lead to the same result. In particular, a recent calculation
by van Elburg [2] indicates a potential flaw in the OPERA experiment [1] that
represents a source of potential error, i.e., that the motion of the
synchronizing GPS satellites causes the clocks to go out of synchronization.
Unfortunately, there are several misconceptions about how GPS satellites work
that pervade the paper. In addition, the principal contention of the paper,
that the experiment is being timed by a moving clock is not substantiated in
the analysis. This paper substantiates the point, as well as introduces a new
source of error in the ""common-view"" method of synchronization of clocks.
