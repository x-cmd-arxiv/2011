population, motivated by modeling dengue fever epidemiology, have reported a
rich dynamic structure including deterministic chaos which was able to explain
the large fluctuations of disease incidences. A comparison between the basic
two-strain dengue model, which already captures differences between primary and
secondary infections, with the four-strain dengue model, that introduces the
idea of competition of multiple strains in dengue epidemics shows that the
difference between first and secondary infections drives the rich dynamics more
than the detailed number of strains to be considered in the model structure.
Chaotic dynamics were found to happen at the same parameter region of interest,
for both the two and the four-strain models, able to explain the fluctuations
observed in empirical data and showing a qualitatively good agreement between
empirical data and model simulation. Since the law of parsimony favors the
simplest of two competing models, the two-strain model would be the better
candidate to be analyzed, giving the expected complex behavior to explain the
fluctuations observed in empirical data, and indeed the better option for
estimating all initial conditions as well as the few model parameters based on
the available incidence data.

This theory is here applied to the steady boundary layer under the hypothesis

direction. The analysis gives an equation for the velocities correlation and
identifies the parameters of the expression of the average velocity through the
statistical properties of the velocity correlation functions. In particular,
the von K\'arm\'an constant, theoretically calculated, is about 0.4, and the
dimensionless Prandtl's length is in function of the Taylor-scale Reynolds

nonlinearity we consider is $f(x,u) = \mu_0 (\phi (x)) u(1-u)$, where $\mu_0$
is a 1-periodic function and $\phi$ is a $\mathcal{C}^1$ increasing function
that satisfies $\lim_{x\to +\infty} \phi (x) = +\infty$ and $\lim_{x\to

term is motivated by its highly heterogeneous nature. We exhibit two different
behaviors for $u$ for large times, depending on the speed of the convergence of
$\phi$ at infinity. If $\phi$ grows sufficiently slowly, then we prove that the
spreading speed of $u$ oscillates between two distinct values. If $\phi$ grows

states described by a first-quantized, analytical wave function into many-body
Fock states. Within them, the single-particle occupations refer to the subset
of Fock-Darwin functions with no nodes. Such states, commonly appearing in
two-dimensional systems subjected to gauge fields, were first discussed in the
context of quantum Hall physics and are nowadays very relevant in the field of
ultracold quantum gases. As important examples, we explicitly apply our
decomposition scheme to the prominent Laughlin and Pfaffian states. This allows
for easily calculating the overlap between arbitrary states with these highly
correlated test states, and thus provides a useful tool to classify correlated
quantum systems. Furthermore, we can directly read off the angular momentum
distribution of a state from its decomposition. Finally we make use of our code
to calculate the normalization factors for Laughlin's famous
quasi-particle/quasi-hole excitations, from which we gain insight into the
intriguing fractional behavior of these excitations.

magnetic helicity of penumbral filaments located in an inner Sunspot penumbra.
To this extent, we inverted data taken with the spectropolarimeter (SP) aboard
Hinode with the SIR (Stokes Inversion based on Response function) code. For the
construction of a 3D geometrical model we applied a genetic algorithm
minimizing the divergence of the magnetic field vector and the net
magnetohydrodynamic force, consequently a force-free solution would be reached
if possible. We estimated two proxies to the magnetic helicity frequently used
in literature: the force-free parameter and the current helicity term. We show
that both proxies are only qualitative indicators of the local twist as the
magnetic field in the area under study significantly departures from a
force-free configuration. The local twist shows significant values only at the
borders of bright penumbral filaments with opposite signs on each side. These
locations are precisely correlated to large electric currents. The average
twist (and writhe) of penumbral structures is very small. The spines (dark
filaments in the background) show a nearly zero writhe. The writhe per unit
length of the intraspines diminishes with increasing length of the tube axes.
Thus, the axes of tubes related to intraspines are less wrung when the tubes
are more horizontal. As the writhe of the spines is very small, we can conclude
that the writhe reaches only significant values when the tube includes the
border of a intraspine.

opinion, a confident voter becomes less committed, or unsure, but does not
change opinion. However, an unsure agent changes opinion by interacting with an
agent of a different opinion. In the mean-field limit, a population of size N
is quickly driven to a mixed state and remains close to this state before
consensus is eventually achieved in a time of the order of ln N. In two
dimensions, the distribution of consensus times is characterized by two
distinct times --- one that scales linearly with N and another that appears to
scale as N^{3/2}. The longer time arises from configurations that fall into
long-lived states that consist of two (or more) single-opinion stripes before
consensus is reached. These stripe states arise from an effective surface
tension between domains of different opinions.

there are two sets of solutions for $g_2$ and $g_2^\prime$. One set, which
agrees with previous values of the product $g_2 g_2^\prime$ extracted from

tendency for self-duality in the case of pure-glue SU(3) gauge theory using the
overlap-based definition of the field-strength tensor. To gauge this property,
we use the absolute X-distribution method which is designed to quantify the
dynamical tendency for polarization for arbitrary random variables that can be
decomposed in a pair of orthogonal subspaces.

et al), the Wigner picture of Parametric Down Conversion (works by Casado et
al) can be interpreted as a local-realistic formalism, without the need to
depart from quantum mechanical predictions at any step, at least for the
relevant subset of QED-states. This involves reinterpreting the expressions for
the detection probabilities, by means of an additional mathematical
manipulation; though such manipulation seemingly provides enough freedom to
guarantee consistency with the expectable, experimentally testable behavior of
detectors, this is, in any case, irrelevant in relation to our main result, of
a purely mathematical nature. Besides, the Wigner-PDC approach opens clear room
to explain the elusive nature of a loop-hole free proof of the incompatibility
of nature with that local-realism, without the need to assume hypothetical
technological inefficiencies yet to overcome after several decades of
experimental work. In relation to this, we also address the consequences of
this framework in relation to typical Bell experiments. Additionally, we also
propose an extremely simple interpretation on that apparently awkward
""subtraction"" of the average ZPF intensity at the Wigner image of the detection
process.

controlled by the anisotropy-energy barrier. Using perturbation theory, exact
diagonalization and stability analysis of the ferromagnetic spin-s Heisenberg
model with coupling or single-site anisotropy, we study the effects of quantum
fluctuations on the height of the energy barrier. Opposed to the classical
case, there is no critical anisotropy strength discriminating between reversal
via coherent rotation and via nucleation/domain-wall propagation. Quantum
fluctuations are seen to lower the barrier depending on the anisotropy
strength, dimensionality and system size and shape. In the weak-anisotropy
limit, a macrospin model is shown to emerge as the effective low-energy theory
where the microscopic spins are tightly aligned due to the ferromagnetic
exchange. The calculation provides explicit expressions for the anisotropy
parameter of the effective macrospin. We find a reduction of the
anisotropy-energy barrier as compared to the classical high spin-s limit.

problem is investigated using tripartite entangled qutrit states. Amplitude
damping, depolarizing, phase damping, trit-phase flip and phase flip channels
are considered to analyze the behaviour of players payoffs. It is seen that
Alice's payoff is heavily influenced by the amplitude damping channel as
compared to the depolarizing and flipping channels. However, for higher level
of decoherence, Alice's payoff is strongly affected by depolarizing noise.
Whereas the behaviour of phase damping channel is symmetrical around 50 %
decoherence. It is also seen that for maximum decoherence (p=1), the influence
of amplitude damping channel dominates over depolarizing and flipping channels.
Whereas, phase damping channel has no effect on the Alice's payoff. Therefore,
the problem becomes noiseless one at maximum decoherence in case of phase
damping channel. Furthermore, the Nash equilibrium of the problem does not
change under decoherence.

resonators, tunable metamaterials have been achieved by a change of environment
using an external stimulus. Metals provide high conductivity to realize a
strong resonant response in metamaterials; however, they contribute very little
to the tunability. The complex conductivity in high-temperature superconducting
films is highly sensitive to external perturbations, which provides new
opportunities in achieving tunable metamaterials resulting directly from the
resonant elements. Here we demonstrate ultrafast dynamical tuning of resonance
in the terahertz (THz) frequency range in YBa_2Cu_3O_7-\delta (YBCO) split-ring
resonator arrays excited by near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses. The
photoexcitation breaks the superconducting Cooper pairs to create the
quasiparticle state. This dramatically modifies the imaginary part of the
complex conductivity and consequently the metamaterial resonance in an
ultrafast timescale. We observed resonance switching accompanied with a wide
range frequency tuning as a function of photoexcitation fluence, which also
strongly depend on the nano-scale thickness of the superconducting films. All
of our experimental results are well reproduced through calculations using an
analytical model, which takes into account the SRR resistance and kinetic
inductance contributed from the complex conductivity of YBCO films. The
theoretical calculations reveal that the increasing SRR resistance upon
increasing photoexcitation fluence is responsible for the reduction of
resonance strength, and both the resistance and kinetic inductance contribute
to the tuning of resonance frequency.

multi-user estimation problem, which is solvable under maximum likelihood
solution but involves high computational complexity. This paper presents a
time-sharing and interference mitigation based EKF (Extended Kalman Filter)
design for joint CFO (carrier frequency offset) and channel estimation at
multiple cognitive users. The key objective is to realize low implementation
complexity by decomposing highdimensional parameters into multiple separate
low-dimensional estimation problems, which can be solved in a time-shared
manner via pipelining operation. We first present a basic EKF design that
estimates the parameters from one TX user to one RX antenna. Then such basic
design is time-shared and reused to estimate parameters from multiple TX users
to multiple RX antennas. Meanwhile, we use interference mitigation module to
cancel the co-channel interference at each RX sample. In addition, we further
propose adaptive noise variance tracking module to improve the estimation
performance. The proposed design enjoys low delay and low buffer size (because
of its online real-time processing), as well as low implementation complexity
(because of time-sharing and pipeling design). Its estimation performance is
verified to be close to Cramer-Rao bound.

spectral type (SpT) between M6 and M8.5. The WISE colors for the new discs are
similar to the primordial (transition) discs earlier detected in USco.
Combining with previous surveys, we find the lowest inner disc fractions
(~20-25%) for a wide range in stellar masses (~0.01-4.0 Msun) in the USco
association. The low disc fractions for high-mass stars in USco (and the other
clusters) are consistent with an evolutionary decline in inner disc frequency
with age. However, BD disc fractions are higher than those for the stars in 1-3
Myr clusters, but very low in the ~5 Myr old USco. Also, primordial BD discs
are still visible in the ~10 Myr TW Hydrae association, whereas the higher mass
stars have all transitioned to the debris stage by this age. The disc
frequencies for BDs do not show any dependence on the stellar density or the
BD/star number ratio in a cluster. We suggest that the large differences in the
observed BD disc fractions between regions may well be due to different BD
formation mechanisms and therefore different initial disc fractions/properties.

that the construction of logical zero states with no first order error terms

to error correction, we show for a particular initial state that error
correction using a single qubit for syndrome measurement yields a similar
output state accuracy to error correction using Shor states as syndrome qubits.

including self-delusion, with the behavior of agents using various definitions

two examples, that the behavior problems can be avoided by formulating the
utility function in two steps: 1) inferring a model of the environment from
interactions, and 2) computing utility as a function of the environment model.
Basing a utility function on a model that the agent must learn implies that the
utility function must initially be expressed in terms of specifications to be
matched to structures in the learned model. These specifications constitute

important and cannot be fixed a priori. For this reason the polarization of

this three dimensional manifold evolves in phase space without ever tearing,
conserving phase-space volume and preserving the connectivity of nearby points.
N-body simulations already follow the motion of this sheet in phase space. This
fact can be used to extract full fine-grained phase-space-structure information

particular molecules, the measurement of which would have maximal potential for
discrimination among the different models examined here. In particular, we find
that the ratios between NH3 and CO; NH2 and CO; NH3 and HCO+ are sensitive to

field. We find a global solar-type main-sequence hard-binary frequency in NGC
188 of 29 +/- 3 % for binaries with periods less than 10^4 days. For
main-sequence hard binaries in the cluster we observe a log-period distribution
that rises towards our detection limit, a roughly Gaussian eccentricity
distribution centered on e = 0.35 (for binaries with periods longer than the
circularization period), and a secondary-mass distribution that rises towards
lower-mass companions. Importantly, the NGC 188 blue straggler binaries show
significantly different characteristics than the solar-type main sequence
binaries in NGC 188. We observe a blue straggler hard-binary frequency of 76
+/- 19 %, three times that of the main sequence. The blue straggler binary
eccentricity - log period distribution is distinct from that of the main
sequence at the 99% confidence level, with the majority of the blue straggler
binaries having periods of order 1000 days and lower eccentricities. The
secondary-mass distribution for these long-period blue straggler binaries is
narrow and peaked with a mean value of about 0.5 Msun. Predictions for
mass-transfer products are most closely consistent with the binary properties

structural properties of highly nonlinear cosmic structures, as e.g. their
average concentration at a given mass, could be significantly modified in the
presence of an interaction between Dark Energy and Dark Matter. While a
constant interaction strength leads to less concentrated density profiles, a
steep growth in time of the coupling function has been shown to determine a
large increase of halo concentrations over a wide range of masses, including
the typical halos hosting luminous spiral galaxies. This determines a
substantial worsening of the ""cusp-core"" tension arising in the standard
$\Lambda $CDM model and provides a direct way to constrain the form of the Dark
Energy interaction. In the present paper we make use of the outcomes of some
high-resolution N-body simulations of a specific class of interacting Dark
Energy models to compare the predicted rotation curves of luminous spiral
galaxies forming in these cosmologies against real observational data. Our
results show how some specific interacting Dark Energy scenarios featuring a
steep growth in time of the coupling function -- which are virtually
indistinguishable from LCDM in the background -- cannot fit the observed
rotation curves of luminous spiral galaxies and can therefore be ruled out only
on the basis of dynamical properties of small-scale structures. Our study is a
pilot investigation of the effects of a Dark Energy interaction at small

  Channels","revised introduction and comparison, submitted to IEEE Trans. on
  Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The causal cognitive relay channel (CRC) has two sender-receiver pairs, in
which the second sender obtains information from the first sender causally and
assists the transmission of both senders. In this paper, we study both the
full- and half-duplex modes. In each mode, we propose two new coding schemes
built successively upon one another to illustrate the impact of different
coding techniques. The first scheme called partial decode-forward binning
(PDF-binning) combines the ideas of partial decode-forward relaying and
Gelfand-Pinsker binning. The second scheme called Han-Kobayashi partial
decode-forward binning (HK-PDF-binning) combines PDF-binning with Han-Kobayashi
coding by further splitting rates and applying superposition coding,
conditional binning and relaxed joint decoding.
  In both schemes, the second sender decodes a part of the message from the
first sender, then uses Gelfand-Pinsker binning technique to bin against the
decoded codeword, but in such a way that allows both state nullifying and
forwarding. For the Gaussian channels, this PDF-binning essentializes to a
correlation between the transmit signal and the binning state, which
encompasses the traditional dirty-paper-coding binning as a special case when
this correlation factor is zero. We also provide the closed-form optimal
binning parameter for each scheme.
  The 2-phase half-duplex schemes are adapted from the full-duplex ones by
removing block Markov encoding, sending different message parts in different
phases and applying joint decoding across both phases. Analysis shows that the
HK-PDF-binning scheme in both modes encompasses the Han-Kobayashi rate region
and achieves both the partial decode-forward relaying rate for the first sender
and interference-free rate for the second sender. Furthermore, this scheme
outperforms all existing schemes.

transform according to SU(2) symmetry restricted to the lattice. Such operators
are labeled by their continuum spins. Overlaps of the operators with the states
obtained by diagonalizing matrices of correlation functions provide a clear
link between continuum spins and lattice states, allowing spins to be
identified. Evidence for an approximate realization of rotational symmetry in
the N* spectrum is presented. In simulations with pion mass = 392 MeV, the
low-lying excited states of lattice QCD are found to have the same quantum
numbers as the states of SU(6)xO(3) symmetry. The lattice spectra are

its resolved stellar population. We find that 2-5Gyr old stars contribute
\som40%+/- 17% of M32's mass, while 55%+/-21% of M32's mass comes from stars
older than 5 Gyr. The mass-weighted mean age and metallicity of M32 at F1 are
<Age>=6.8+/-1.5 Gyr and <[M/H]>=-0.01+/-0.08 dex. The SFH additionally
indicates the presence of young (<2 Gyr old), metal-poor ([M/H]\sim-0.7) stars,
suggesting that blue straggler stars contribute ~2% of the mass at F1; the
remaining \sim3% of the mass is in young metal-rich stars. Line-strength
indices computed from the SFH imply a light-weighted mean age and metallicity
of 4.9 Gyr and [M/H] = -0.12 dex, and single-stellar-population-equivalent
parameters of 2.9+/-0.2 Gyr and [M/H]=0.02+/-0.01 dex at F1 (~2.7 re). This
contradicts spectroscopic studies that show a steep age gradient from M32's
center to 1re. The inferred SFH of the M31 background field F2 reveals that the
majority of its stars are old, with \sim95% of its mass already acquired 5-14
Gyr ago. It is composed of two dominant populations; \sim30%+/-7.5% of its mass
is in a 5-8 Gyr old population, and \sim65%+/-9% of the mass is in a 8-14 Gyr
old population. The mass-weighted mean age and metallicity of F2 are
<Age>=9.2+/-1.2 Gyr and <[M/H]>=-0.10+/-0.10 dex, respectively. Our results
suggest that the inner disk and spheroid populations of M31 are
indistinguishable from those of the outer disk and spheroid. Assuming the mean
age of M31's disk at F2 (\sim1 disk scale length) to be 5-9 Gyr, our results
agree with an inside-out disk formation scenario for M31's disk.

quasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) from the neutron star (NS) transient and
11 Hz X-ray pulsar IGR J17480-2446, located in the globular cluster Terzan 5.
The increase in burst rate that we found during its 2010 outburst, when
persistent luminosity rose from 0.1 to 0.5 times the Eddington limit, is in
qualitative agreement with thermonuclear burning theory yet opposite to all
previous observations of thermonuclear bursts. Thermonuclear bursts gradually
evolved into a mHz QPO when the accretion rate increased, and vice versa. The
mHz QPOs from IGR J17480-2446 resemble those previously observed in other
accreting NSs, yet they feature lower frequencies (by a factor ~3) and occur
when the persistent luminosity is higher (by a factor 4-25). We find four
distinct bursting regimes and a steep (close to inverse cubic) decrease of the
burst recurrence time with increasing persistent luminosity. We compare these
findings to nuclear burning models and find evidence for a transition between
the pure helium and mixed hydrogen/helium ignition regimes when the persistent
luminosity was about 0.3 times the Eddington limit. We also point out important
discrepancies between the observed bursts and theory, which predicts brighter
and less frequent bursts, and suggest that an additional source of heat in the
NS envelope is required to reconcile the observed and expected burst
properties. We discuss the impact of NS magnetic field and spin on the expected
nuclear burning regimes, in the context of this particular pulsar.

occur via the r-process because the r-process is a primary process that would
have operated early in the Galaxy's history. This idea is strongly supported by
the fact that the abundance pattern in many metal-poor stars matches well the
inferred Solar r-process abundance pattern in the mass range between the second
and third r-process abundance peaks. Nevertheless, a significant number of
metal-poor stars do not share this standard r-process template. In this Letter
we suggest that the nuclides observed in many of these stars are produced by
the r-process, but that it is prevented from running to completion in more
massive stars by collapse to black holes before the r-process is completed,
creating a ""truncated r-process,"" or ""tr-process."" We find that the observed
fraction of tr-process stars is qualitatively what one would expect from the
initial mass function, and that an apparent sharp truncation observed at around
mass 160 could result from a combination of collapses to black holes and the
difficulty of observing the higher mass rare earths. We test the tr-process
hypothesis with r-process calculations that are terminated before all r-process
trajectories have been ejected. We find qualitative agreement between
observation and theory when black hole collapse and observational realities are
taken into account.

As a measure of the anharmonic multiphoton-correlations, we compute the Fano

and find that phonon-mediated scattering plays a qualitatively important role

t and let F be a set of forbidden pairs of vertices. We say that a path in G is
safe, if it contains at most one vertex from each pair {u, v} in F. Given G and
F, the path avoiding forbidden pairs (PAFP) problem is to find a safe s-t path
in G. We systematically study the complexity of different special cases of the
PAFP problem defined according to the mutual positions of forbidden pairs. Fix
one topological ordering of vertices; we say that pairs {u, v} and {x, y} are
disjoint, if u, v < x, y, nested, if u < x, y < v, and halving, if u < x < v <
y. The PAFP problem is known to be NP-hard in general or if no two pairs are
disjoint; we prove that it remains NP-hard even when no two forbidden pairs are
nested. On the other hand, if no two pairs are halving, the problem is known to
be solvable in cubic time. We simplify and improve this result by showing an
O(M(n)) time algorithm, where M(n) is the time to multiply two n \times n

analyzed UDs is precisely circular, ii) the diameter-intensity relationship
only holds in bright umbral areas, and iii) UD velocities are inversely related
to their lifetime. While nearly all photospheric UDs can be identified in the
low chromospheric images, some small closely spaced UDs appear in the low
chromosphere as a single cluster. Slow moving and long living UDs seem to exist
in both the low chromosphere and photosphere, while fast moving and short
living UDs are mainly detected in the photospheric images. Comparison to the 3D
MHD simulations showed that both types of UDs display, on average, very similar
statistical characteristics. However, i) the average number of observed UDs per

studied via intermediate hadron loops, e.g. $D^* K$, to which both states have
strong couplings. By constructing the two-state mixing propagator matrix that
respects the unitarity constraint and calculating the vertex coupling form
factors in a chiral quark model, we can extract the masses, widths and mixing
angles of the physical states. Two poles can be identified in the propagator
matrix. One is at $\sqrt{s}=2454.5 \ \textrm{MeV}$ corresponding to
$D_{s1}(2460)$ and the other at $\sqrt{s}=(2544.9-1.0i) \ \textrm{MeV}$
corresponding to $D_{s1}(2536)$. For $D_{s1}(2460)$, a large mixing angle
$\theta=47.5^\circ$ between ${}^3P_1$ and ${}^1P_1$ is obtained. It is driven
by the real part of the mixing matrix element and corresponds to
$\theta'=12.3^\circ$ between the $j=1/2$ and $j=3/2$ state mixing in the heavy
quark limit. For $D_{s1}(2536)$, a mixing angle $\theta=39.7^\circ$ which
corresponds to $\theta'=4.4^\circ$ in the heavy quark limit is found. An
additional phase angle $\phi=-6.9^\circ \sim 6.9^\circ$ is needed at the pole
mass of $D_{s1}(2536)$ since the mixing matrix elements are complex numbers.
Both the real and imaginary part are found important for the large mixing
angle. We show that the new experimental data from BaBar provide a strong
constraint on the mixing angle at the mass of $D_{s1}(2536)$, from which two
values can be extracted, i.e. $\theta_1=32.1^\circ$ or $\theta_2=38.4^\circ$.
Our study agrees well with the latter one. Detailed analysis of the mass shift
procedure due to the coupled channel effects is also presented.

to higher dimensional cases, and we provide explicit formalism in three space
dimensions. Instead of the vortices driving conventional Fermi liquid into
quantum spin liquid states in 2D, it is the vortex lines to lead to the
instability of Fermi liquid in 3D. The extended formalism can result in rich
consequences when the vortex lines condense in different degrees of freedom.
For example, when the vortex lines condense in charge phase degrees of freedom,
the resulting effective fermionic action is found to be equivalent to that
obtained by well-studied slave-particle approaches for Hubbard and/or Anderson
lattice models, which confirm the validity of the extended dual formalism in
3D. When the vortex lines condense in spin phase degrees of freedom, a doublon
metal with a spin gap and an instability to the unconventional superconducting
pairing can be obtained. In addition, when the vortex lines condense in both
phase degrees, an exotic doubled U(1) gauge theory occurs which describes a
separation of spin-opposite fermionic excitations. It is noted that the first
two features have been discussed in a similar way in 2D, the last one has not

the strength with which the scalar couples to matter. We argue that Jacobson's

that the two black holes have different masses. Quasar OJ 287, situated at

argue that the absence of observable scalar dipole radiation in this system
yields the remarkable bound $|\,\mu| < (16 \, \hbox{days})^{-1}$ on the
instantaneous time derivative at this redshift (as opposed to constraining an
average field difference, $\Delta \phi$, over cosmological times), provided
only that the scalar is light enough to be radiated --- i.e. $m \lsim 10^{-23}$

optical star within 3 sigma of the position of RX J0042.3+4115 had a F435W (~B)
magnitude of 25.4+/-0.2; M_B > -0.4, hence we find a low mass donor likely. RX
J0042.3+4115 was persistently bright over ~12 years. Spectral fits revealed
characteristic black hole binary states: a low/hard state at 2.08+/-0.08 E+38
erg/s, and a steep power law state at 2.41+/-0.05 E+38 erg/s (0.3--10 keV). The
high luminosity low state suggests a ~20 M_Sun primary; this is high, but
within the range of known stellar black hole masses. The inner disk temperature
during the steep power law state is 2.24$\pm$0.15 keV, high but strikingly
similar to that of GRS 1915+105, the only known Galactic black hole binary with
a low mass donor t o be persistently bright. Therefore RX J0042.3+4115 may be
an analog for GRS 1915+105; however, other mechanisms may account for its
behavior. We find compelling evidence for an extended corona during the steep
power law state, because compact corona models where the seed photons for
Comptonization are tied to the inner disc temperature are rejected.

correction in theoretical large scale computational and communications
architecture designs. Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and
their natural 2-dimensional nearest neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an
obvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems.
While fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants,
two of which are the planar- and defect- based codes. Planar codes require
fewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are
restricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between
encoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the
inherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique
enabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations,
maintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique
comprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform
universal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing
the need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the
overall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further
reduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how
lattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct
(and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT
between two distance 3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half
of that required in any other known construction in 2D.

turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM). We begin with revisiting
gyroresonance acceleration by taking into account the fluctuations of grain
guiding center along a uniform magnetic field (i.e. nonlinear theory--NLT). We
calculate grain velocities due to gyroresonance by fast MHD modes using the NLT
for different phases of the ISM, and compare with results obtained using
quasi-linear theory (QLT). We find for the parameters applicable to the typical
ISM phases that the fluctuations of grain guiding center reduce grain
velocities by less than 15 percent, but they can be important for more special
circumstances. We confirm that large grains can be accelerated to
super-Alfvenic velocities through gyroresonance. For such super-Alfvenic
grains, we investigate the effect of further acceleration via transit time
damping (TTD) by fast modes. We find that due to the broadening of resonance
condition in the NLT, the TTD acceleration is not only important for the
cosines of grain pitch angle relative to the magnetic field mu>V_{A}/v, but
also for mu<V_{A}/v where v is the grain velocity and V_{A} is the Alfven
speed. We show that the TTD acceleration is dominant over the gyroresonance for
large grains, and can increase substantially grain velocities induced by
gyroresonance acceleration. We quantify another stochastic acceleration
mechanism arising from low frequency Alfven waves. We discuss the range of
applicability of the mechanisms and their implications.

populations of stars have been found in the solar neighborhood. Precise
relative ages and orbital parameters are determined for 67 halo and 16
thick-disk stars having metallicities in the range -1.4 < [Fe/H] < -0.4 to
better understand the context of the two halo populations in the formation and
evolution of the Galaxy. Ages are derived by comparing the positions of stars
in the logT_{eff}-log(g) diagram with isochrones from the Y^2 models
interpolated to the exact [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] values of each star. Possible
systematic errors in T_{eff} and log(g) are considered and corrected. With
space velocities from Paper I as initial conditions, orbital integrations have
been carried out using a detailed, observationally constrained Milky Way model
including a bar and spiral arms. The `high-alpha' halo stars have ages 2-3 Gyr
larger than the `low-alpha' ones. The orbital parameters show very distinct
differences between the `high-alpha' and `low-alpha' halo stars. The
`low-alpha' ones have r_{max}'s to 30-40 kpc, z_{max}'s to approx. 18 kpc, and
e_{max}'s clumped at values greater than 0.85, while the `high-alpha' ones,
r_{max}'s to about 16 kpc, z_{max}'s to 6-8 kpc, and e_{max} more or less
uniformly distributed over 0.4-1.0. A dual in situ-plus-accretion formation
scenario best explains the existence and characteristics of these two halo
populations, but one remaining defect is that this model is not consistent
regarding the r_{max}'s obtained for the in situ `high-alpha' component; the
predicted values are too small. It appears that omega Cen may have contributed
in a significant way to the existence of the `low-alpha' component; recent
models, including dynamical friction and tidal stripping, have produced orbital
parameters as great as those of the `low-alpha' component.

OGLE-2011-BLG-1101/MOA-2011-BLG-325. For all events, we measure the linear
limb-darkening coefficients of the surface brightness profile of source stars
by measuring the deviation of the light curves near the peak affected by the
finite-source effect. For 7 events, we measure the Einstein radii and the
lens-source relative proper motions. Among them, 5 events are found to have
Einstein radii less than 0.2 mas, making the lenses candidates of very low-mass
stars or brown dwarfs. For MOA-2011-BLG-274, especially, the small Einstein
radius of $\theta_{\rm E}\sim 0.08$ mas combined with the short time scale of
$t_{\rm E}\sim 2.7$ days suggests the possibility that the lens is a
free-floating planet. For MOA-2009-BLG-174, we measure the lens parallax and
thus uniquely determine the physical parameters of the lens. We also find that
the measured lens mass of $\sim 0.84\ M_\odot$ is consistent with that of a
star blended with the source, suggesting that the blend is likely to be the
lens. Although we find planetary signals for none of events, we provide
exclusion diagrams showing the confidence levels excluding the existence of a
planet as a function of the separation and mass ratio.

original Q-component spins, or in the geometrical reformulation via
Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters. While the FK representation makes sense for
arbitrary real values of Q by construction, it was only shown very recently
that the spin representation can be promoted to the same level of generality.
In this paper we show how to define the Potts model in terms of observables
that simultaneously keep track of the spin and FK degrees of freedom. This is
first done algebraically in terms of a transfer matrix that couples three
different representations of a partition algebra. Using this, one can study
correlation functions involving any given number of propagating spin clusters
with prescribed colours, each of which contains any given number of distinct FK
clusters. For 0 <= Q <= 4 the corresponding critical exponents are all of the
Kac form h_{r,s}, with integer indices r,s that we determine exactly both in
the bulk and in the boundary versions of the problem. In particular, we find
that the set of points where an FK cluster touches the hull of its surrounding
spin cluster has fractal dimension d_{2,1} = 2 - 2 h_{2,1}. If one constrains
this set to points where the neighbouring spin cluster extends to infinity, we
show that the dimension becomes d_{1,3} = 2 - 2 h_{1,3}. Our results are
supported by extensive transfer matrix and Monte Carlo computations.

surge form. The filament first underwent a full development within 46 minutes
and then began to erupt 9 minutes later, followed by a compact, impulsive X-ray
class M2.2 flare with a two ribbon nature only at the early eruption phase.
During the eruption, its top rose, whereas the two legs remained rooted in the
chromosphere and swelled little perpendicular to the rising direction. This led
to a surge-like eruption with a narrow angular extent. Similar to the recent
observations for standard and blowout X-ray jets by Moore et al., we thus
define it as a ""blowout H_alpha surge"". Furthermore, our observations showed
that the eruption was associated with (1) a coronal mass ejection guided by a
preexisting streamer, (2) abrupt, significant, and persistent changes in the
photospheric magnetic field around the filament, and (3) sudden disappearance
of a small pore. These observations thus provide evidence that blowout surge is
a small-scale version of large-scale filament eruption in many aspects. Our
observations further suggest that at least part of H_alpha surges belong to
blowout-type ones, and exact distinction between standard and blowout H_alpha
surges is important in understanding their different origins and associated
eruptive phenomena.

the Jeans paradigm for determining the critical scale above which gravitational
collapse is allowed. We start by discussing the stability of an ideal
self-gravitating plasma embedded in a constant magnetic field. We outline the
existence of an anisotropic feature of the gravitational collapse. In fact,
while in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field the Jeans length is
enhanced by the contribution of the magnetic pressure, outside this plane
perturbations are governed by the usual Jeans criterium. The anisotropic
collapse of a density contrast is sketched in details, suggesting that the
linear evolution provides anisotropic initial conditions for the non-linear
stage, where this effect could be strongly enforced. The same problem is then
faced in the presence of non-zero resistivity and the conditions for the
gravitational collapse are correspondingly extended. The relevant feature
emerging in this resistive scenario is the cancellation of the collapse
anisotropy in weakly conducting plasmas. In this case, the instability of a
self-gravitating resistive plasma is characterized by the standard isotropic
Jeans length in any directions. The limit of very small resistivity coefficient
is finally addressed, elucidating how reminiscence of the collapse anisotropy
can be found in the different value of the perturbation frequency inside and
outside the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field.

also discuss the direct productions of a GeV scale vector $U$ boson in these

for mediating a new $U(1)_d$ interaction, as recently exploited in the context

a fast charge particle collision at small momentum transfer. It is determined
not only by dipole but also by quadrupole transitions, the contribution of
which can be considerably enhanced as compared to the case of photoionization.
There the non-dipole parameters are suppressed as compared to the dipole ones
by the parameter \omega R/c << 1, where is the photon energy, R is the ionized
shell radius and c is the speed of light. This suppression in fast
electron-atom collisions can be considerably reduced: the corresponding
expansion parameter \omega R/ \nu << 1 is much bigger than in photoionization,
since the speed of the incoming electron is much smaller than c. In formation
of the angular distribution it is decisively important that the ionizing field
in collision process is longitudinal, while in photoionization - it is
transversal.

some nd-subshells of multi-electron noble gas atoms Ar, Kr and Xe, at several
transferred momentum values: q=0.0, 0.1, 1.1, 2.1. Even for very small

new formula for the Finsler norm of a vector for the Teichm\""uller metric that
uses the extremal length function. We also describe an embedding of projective

already studied the close (<100kpc/h) and the large scale (<1 Mpc/h)
environment of a local sample of Sy1, Sy2 and bright IRAS galaxies (BIRG) and
their respective control samples. The results led us to the conclusion that a
close encounter appears capable of activating a sequence where an absorption
line galaxy (ALG) galaxy becomes first a starburst, then a Sy2 and finally a
Sy1. Here we investigate the activity of neighboring galaxies of different
types of AGN, since both galaxies of an interacting pair should be affected. To
this end we present the optical spectroscopy and X-ray imaging of 30
neighbouring galaxies around two local (z<0.034) samples of 10 Sy1 and 13 Sy2
galaxies. Based on the optical spectroscopy we find that more than 70% of all
neighbouring galaxies exhibit star forming and/or nuclear activity (namely
recent star formation and/or AGN), while an additional X-ray analysis showed
that this percentage might be significantly higher. Furthermore, we find a
statistically significant correlation, at a 99.9% level, between the value of
the neighbour's [OIII]/H\beta ratio and the activity type of the central active
galaxy, i.e. the neighbours of Sy2 galaxies are systematically more ionized
than the neighbours of Sy1s. This result, in combination with trends found
using the Equivalent Width of the H\alpha emission line and the stellar
population synthesis code STARLIGHT, indicate differences in the stellar mass,
metallicity and star formation history between the samples. Our results point
towards a link between close galaxy interactions and activity and also provide
more clues regarding the possible evolutionary sequence inferred by our
previous studies.

In this region, simulation and experiment consistently show coherent in-phase
fluctuations in density, plasma potential and also in electron temperature.
Ion-saturation current measurements turn out to reproduce density fluctuations
quite well. Fluctuations in the floating potential, however, are strongly
influenced by temperature fluctuations and, hence, are strongly distorted
compared to the actual plasma potential. These results suggest that
interpreting floating as plasma-potential fluctuations while disregarding
temperature effects is not justified near the separatrix of hot fusion plasmas.
Here, floating potential measurements lead to corrupted results on the ExB

alleged quantum non-locality relied on inhomogeneous Bell inequalities
involving an additional assumption (no-enhancement) whose role had not been
sufficiently examined (in contrast to homogeneous inequalities, where the role
of low detection rates is well acknowledged). A first contribution of this
paper is to provide explicit examples of how a model of hidden local variables
(LHV) defying no-enhancement is able to produce a violation of an inhomogeneous
inequality, a possibility that so far was pointed out only in qualitative
terms. On the other hand, recent tests have attempted to overcome this reliance
on supplementary assumptions, but still give rise to doubt, due to:
  (i) violations are extremely low, which points to some systematical error
(the fact that alleged random errors of the detectors seem to conspire to
interfere exactly at such narrow strip around the frontier with local-realism
and not a different part of the spectrum that QM would theoretically produce
can hardly be considered just coincidence);
  (ii) the correspondence between the observations and one or another quantum
state is not clear either, as recent models cannot be really validated against
the available data (they have equal or more parameters than restrictions).
  Following (ii), it would be convenient to verify a more significant set of
quantum predictions, instead of just the few counting rates involved in a
particular Bell inequality. Finally, another type of ""no-go"" tests (an instance
of which we examine here) also present subtleties which call for serious
examination.

little attention has been paid to higher-order photon components in the PDC
process, yet these ultimately limit the prospects of generating single-photons
of high quality. In this paper we investigate the impacts of higher-order
photon components and multiple frequency modes on the heralding rates and
single-photon fidelities. This enables us to determine the limits of PDC
sources for single-photon generation. Our results show that a perfectly
single-mode PDC source in conjunction with a photon-number resolving detector
is ultimately capable of creating single-photon Fock states with unit fidelity
and a maximal state creation probability of 25%. Hence an array of 17 switched
sources is required to build a deterministic (>99% emission probability) pure
single-photon source.

the production cross section for new physics: sigma < (22-129) fb in the
context of a generalised model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GGM)
with a bino-like lightest neutralino, sigma < (27-91) fb in the context of a
minimal model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (SPS8) and (15-27) fb in
the context of a specific model with one universal extra dimension (UED). A 95%
CL lower limit of 805 GeV, for bino masses above 50 GeV, is set on the GGM
gluino mass. Lower limits of 145 TeV and 1.23 TeV are set on the SPS8 breaking

often be significantly improved by using signal models based on sparse

involves solving non-smooth optimization problems that are computationally
expensive. While significant efforts have focused on developing digital
algorithms specifically for this problem, these algorithms are inappropriate
for many applications because of the time and power requirements necessary to
solve large optimization problems. Based on recent work in computational
neuroscience, we explore the potential advantages of continuous time dynamical
systems for solving sparse approximation problems if they were implemented in
analog VLSI. Specifically, in the simulated task of recovering synthetic and
MRI data acquired via compressive sensing techniques, we show that these
systems can potentially perform recovery at time scales of 10-20{\mu}s,
supporting datarates of 50-100 kHz (orders of magnitude faster that digital
algorithms). Furthermore, we show analytically that a wide range of sparse
approximation problems can be solved in the same basic architecture, including
approximate $\ell^p$ norms, modified $\ell^1$ norms, re-weighted $\ell^1$ and
$\ell^2$, the block $\ell^1$ norm and classic Tikhonov regularization.

renders beam imaging with optical transition radiation impossible. The
instability can be suppressed by introducing additional energy spread, i.e.,
""heating"" the electron beam, as demonstrated by the successful operation of the
laser heater system at the Linac Coherent Light Source. The increased energy
spread is typically tolerable for self-amplified spontaneous emission FELs but
limits the effectiveness of advanced FEL schemes such as seeding. In this
paper, we present a reversible electron beam heating system based on two
transverse deflecting radio-frequency structures (TDSs) up and downstream of a
magnetic bunch compressor chicane. The additional energy spread is introduced
in the first TDS, which suppresses the microbunching instability, and then is
eliminated in the second TDS. We show the feasibility of the microbunching gain
suppression based on calculations and simulations including the effects of
coherent synchrotron radiation. Acceptable electron beam and radio-frequency

expression of the nuclear matter fourth-order symmetry energy
$E_{sym,4}(\rho)$. Based on two accurately calibrated interactions FSUGold and
IU-FSU, our results show that the value of $E_{sym,4}(\rho)$ at normal nuclear
matter density $\rho_{0}$ is generally less than 1 MeV, confirming the
empirical parabolic approximation to the equation of state for asymmetric
nuclear matter at $\rho_{0}$. On the other hand, we find that the
$E_{sym,4}(\rho)$ may become nonnegligible at high densities. Furthermore, the
analytical form of the $E_{sym,4}(\rho)$ provides the possibility to study the
higher-order effects on the isobaric incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear
matter, i.e., $K_{sat}(\delta)=K_{0}+K_{sat,2}\delta ^{2}+K_{sat,4}\delta
^{4}+\mathcal{O}(\delta ^{6})$ where $\delta =(\rho_{n}-\rho_{p})/\rho $ is the
isospin asymmetry, and we find that the value of $K_{sat,4}$ is generally small
compared with that of the $K_{sat,2}$. In addition, we study the effects of the
$E_{sym,4}(\rho)$ on the proton fraction $x_{p}$ and the core-crust transition
density $\rho_{t}$ and pressure $P_{t}$ in neutron stars. Interestingly, we
find that, compared with the results from the empirical parabolic
approximation, including the $E_{sym,4}(\rho)$ contribution can significantly
enhance the $x_{p}$ at high densities and strongly reduce the $\rho_{t}$ and
$P_{t}$ in neutron stars, demonstrating that the widely used empirical
parabolic approximation may cause large errors in determining the $x_{p}$ at
high densities as well as the $\rho_{t}$ and $P_{t}$ in neutron stars within
the nonlinear relativistic mean field model, consistent with previous
nonrelativistic calculations.

two ME forms are shown to yield equivalent population dynamics and fluorescence
spectra for a continuous wave (cw) driving field. We also demonstrate that a
Markov approximation is valid for computing the incoherent scattering processes
and we subsequently exploit the Markovian TC ME to explore the resonance

exciton-emitted spectra are studied and these are found to have qualitatively
different spectral features. Using a coherent driving field, the well known
characteristics of the atomic Mollow triplet are shown to be considerably
modified with electron--acoustic-phonon scattering and we highlight the key
effects arising from both cavity coupling and electron-phonon coupling. Regimes
of pronounced cavity feeding and anharmonic cavity-QED are exemplified, and we
find that the cavity coupling depends sensitively on the exciton-cavity
