statistical reporting even when equally applicable methods yield very different
results. Examples of equally applicable methods can correspond to those of
different ancillary statistics in frequentist inference and of different prior
distributions in Bayesian inference. More broadly, choices are made between
parametric and nonparametric methods and between frequentist and Bayesian
methods.
  Rather than choosing a single method, it can be safer, in a game-theoretic
sense, to combine those that are equally appropriate in light of the available
information. Since methods of combining subjectively assessed probability
distributions are not objective enough for that purpose, this paper introduces
a method of distribution combination that does not require any assignment of
distribution weights. It does so by formalizing a hedging strategy in terms of
a game between three players: nature, a statistician combining distributions,
and a statistician refusing to combine distributions. The optimal move of the
first statistician reduces to the solution of a simpler problem of selecting an
estimating distribution that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler loss maximized over
the plausible distributions to be combined. The resulting combined distribution
is a linear combination of the most extreme of the distributions to be combined
that are scientifically plausible. The optimal weights are close enough to each
other that no extreme distribution dominates the others.
  The new methodology is illustrated by combining conflicting empirical Bayes
methodologies in the context of gene expression data analysis.

proper renormalization scale of the running coupling. The extended
renormalization group equations, which express the invariance of physical
observables under both the renormalization scale- and scheme-parameter
transformations, provide a convenient way for estimating the scale- and
scheme-dependence of the physical process. In this paper, we present a solution
for the scale-equation of the extended renormalization group equations at the
four-loop level. Using the principle of maximum conformality (PMC) /
Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) scale-setting method, all non-conformal
$\{\beta_i\}$ terms in the perturbative expansion series can be summed into the
running coupling, and the resulting scale-fixed predictions are independent of
the renormalization scheme. Different schemes lead to different effective
PMC/BLM scales, but the final results are scheme independent. Conversely, from
the requirement of scheme independence, one not only can obtain
scheme-independent commensurate scale relations among different observables,
but also determine the scale displacements among the PMC/BLM scales which are
derived under different schemes. In principle, the PMC/BLM scales can be fixed
order-by-order, and as a useful reference, we present a systematic and
scheme-independent procedure for setting PMC/BLM scales up to NNLO. An explicit
application for determining the scale setting of $R_{e^{+}e^-}(Q)$ up to four
loops is presented. By using the world average $\alpha^{\bar{MS}}_s(M_Z)
=0.1184 \pm 0.0007$, we obtain the asymptotic scale for the 't Hooft associated
with the $\bar{MS}$ scheme, $\Lambda^{'tH}_{\bar{MS}}= 245^{+9}_{-10}$ MeV, and
the asymptotic scale for the conventional $\bar{MS}$ scheme,
$\Lambda_{\bar{MS}}= 213^{+19}_{-8}$ MeV.

Physics; that has been studied experimentally in the laboratory and, in the
last decades, by performing numerical simulations. The Discrete Element Method
simulates the mechanical behavior of a media formed by a set of particles which
interact through their contact points. The difficulty in reproducing vacuum and
low-gravity environments makes numerical simulations the most promising
technique in the study of granular media under these conditions. In this work,
relevant processes in minor bodies of the Solar System are studied using the
Discrete Element Method. Results of simulations of size segregation in
low-gravity environments in the cases of the asteroids Eros and Itokawa are
presented. The segregation of particles with different densities was analysed,
in particular, the case of comet P/Hartley 2. The surface shaking in these
different gravity environments could produce the ejection of particles from the
surface at very low relative velocities. The shaking causing the above
processes is due to: impacts, explosions like the release of energy by the
liberation of internal stresses or the re accommodation of material.
Simulations of the passage of impact-induced seismic waves through a granular
medium were also performed. We present several applications of the Discrete
Element Methods for the study of the physical evolution of agglomerates of
rocks under low-gravity environments.

concisely expressed in terms of Green's functions of the center and an
argument-shifted self-energy of the lead. The expression of CGF is valid in
both transient and steady state regimes. We consider three different initial
conditions for the density operator and show numerically, for one-dimensional
(1D) linear chains, how transient behavior differs from each other but finally
approaches the same steady state, independent of the initial distributions. We
also derive the CGF for the joint probability distribution $P(Q_L,Q_R)$, and
discuss the correlations between $Q_L$ and $Q_R$. We calculate the total
entropy flow to the reservoirs. In the steady state we explicitly show that the
CGF obeys steady state fluctuation theorem (SSFT). Classical results are
obtained by taking $\hbar \to 0$. The method is also applied to the counting of

the distributed controller. Second, we optimize feedback gains subject to
structural constraints determined by the identified sparsity patterns. In the
first step, the sparsity structure of feedback gains is identified using the
alternating direction method of multipliers, which is a powerful algorithm
well-suited to large optimization problems. This method alternates between
promoting the sparsity of the controller and optimizing the closed-loop

of attention in recent years. Pattern mining can help to obtain models for
structured domains, such as graphs and sequences, and has been proposed as a
means to obtain more accurate and more interpretable models. Despite the large
amount of publications devoted to this topic, we believe however that an
overview of what has been accomplished in this area is missing. This paper
presents our perspective on this evolving area. We identify the principles of
pattern mining that are important when mining patterns for models and provide
an overview of pattern-based classification methods. We categorize these
methods along the following dimensions: (1) whether they post-process a
pre-computed set of patterns or iteratively execute pattern mining algorithms;
(2) whether they select patterns model-independently or whether the pattern
selection is guided by a model. We summarize the results that have been
obtained for each of these methods.

compressive strain has been analyzed with high pressure Raman spectroscopy and
high pressure x-ray diffraction. The pressure dependent variation of the Ag and
B2g bending modes from the O-Ce-O unit is suppressed when the proton conductor
is hydrated, affecting directly the proton transfer by locally changing the
electron density of the oxygen ions. Compressive strain causes a hardening of
the Ce-O stretching bond. The activation barrier for proton conductivity is
raised, in line with recent findings using high pressure and high temperature
impedance spectroscopy. The increasing Raman frequency of the B1g and B3g modes
thus implies that the phonons become hardened and increase the vibration energy
in the a-c crystal plane upon compressive strain, whereas phonons are relaxed
in the b-axis, and thus reveal softening of the Ag and B2g modes. Lattice
toughening in the a-c crystal plane raises therefore a higher activation
barrier for proton transfer and thus anisotropic conductivity. The experimental
findings of the interaction of protons with the ceramic host lattice under
external strain may provide a general guideline for yet to develop epitaxial
strained proton conducting thin film systems with high proton mobility and low
activation energy.

under \emph{adversarial} uncertainty. This problem can be modeled as a
two-persons zero-sum game between an Engineer and Nature. The Engineer controls
a subset of the variables (nodes in the graph), and tries to assign their
values to maximize an objective function. Nature controls the complementary
subset of variables and tries to minimize the same objective. This setting
encompasses estimation and optimization problems under model uncertainty, and
strategic problems with a graph structure. Von Neumann's minimax theorem
guarantees the existence of a (minimax) pair of randomized strategies that
provide optimal robustness for each player against its adversary.
  We prove several structural properties of this strategy pair in the case of
graph-structured payoff function. In particular, the randomized minimax
strategies (distributions over variable assignments) can be chosen in such a
way to satisfy the Markov property with respect to the graph. This
significantly reduces the problem dimensionality. Finally we introduce a
message passing algorithm to solve this minimax problem. The algorithm
generalizes max-product belief propagation to this new domain.

overhead and thereby increase the network performance. A MANET can have many
clusters in it. This paper presents an algorithm which is a combination of the
four main clustering schemes- the ID based clustering, connectivity based,
probability based and the weighted approach. An Ant colony optimization based
approach is used to minimize the number of clusters in MANET. This can also be
considered as a minimum dominating set problem in graph theory. The algorithm
considers various parameters like the number of nodes, the transmission range

production of HBO is connected to NBO and is caused by changes in the
physical/radiative properties of the inner accretion disk, although there is a
lack of substantial spectral evidence to support this. In this {\it Letter}, we
present the results of an analysis of a RXTE observation of a Z source GX~5-1,
where the 6 Hz NBO is simultaneously detected along with a HBO at 51 Hz. The
variations in the intensity and the associated power density spectrum indicate
that the HBO and NBO are strongly coupled, originating from the same location
in the inner accretion disk. The absence of HBO and NBO in the lower energy
bands, an increase in the rms amplitude with energy and a smooth transition
among them suggest that they are produced in the hot inner regions of the
accretion disk. Based on a spectral analysis, we found a signature of changing
or physically modified inner disk front during the coupled HBO and NBO
evolution. We explore the various models to explain the observed phenomenon and
propose that the NBO is affiliated to the oscillations in the thick/puffed-up
inner region of the accretion disk.

underdetermined linear models with perturbation present in both the
measurements and the dictionary matrix. Existing methods have high computation
and low efficiency. The total least-squares (TLS) criterion has well-documented
merits in solving linear regression problems while FOCal Underdetermined System
Solver (FOCUSS) has low-computation complexity in sparse recovery. Based on TLS
and FOCUSS methods, the present paper develops more fast and robust algorithms,
TLS-FOCUSS and SD-FOCUSS. TLS-FOCUSS algorithm is not only near-optimum but
also fast in solving TLS optimization problems under sparsity constraints, and
thus fit for large scale computation. In order to reduce the complexity of
algorithm further, another suboptimal algorithm named D-FOCUSS is devised.
SD-FOCUSS can be applied in MMV (multiple-measurement-vectors) TLS model, which
fills the gap of solving linear regression problems under sparsity constraints.
The convergence of TLS-FOCUSS algorithm and SD-FOCUSS algorithm is established
with mathematical proof. The simulations illustrate the advantage of TLS-FOCUSS
and SD-FOCUSS in accuracy and stability, compared with other algorithms.

mixing, is studied by means of the field theoretic renormalization group.
Specifically, relaxational stochastic dynamics of a non-conserved
multicomponent order parameter of the Ashkin-Teller-Potts model, coupled to a
random velocity field with prescribed statistics, is considered. The velocity
is taken Gaussian, white in time, with correlation function of the form
$\propto \delta(t-t') /|{\bf k}_{\bot}|^{d-1+\xi}$, where ${\bf k}_{\bot}$ is
the component of the wave vector, perpendicular to the distinguished direction
(""direction of the flow"") --- the $d$-dimensional generalization of the
ensemble introduced by Avellaneda and Majda [1990 {\it Commun. Math. Phys.}
{\bf 131} 381] within the context of passive scalar advection. This model can
describe a rich class of physical situations. It is shown that, depending on
the values of parameters that define self-interaction of the order parameter
and the relation between the exponent $\xi$ and the space dimension $d$, the
system exhibits various types of large-scale scaling behaviour, associated with
different infrared attractive fixed points of the renormalization-group
equations. In addition to known asymptotic regimes (critical dynamics of the
Potts model and passively advected field without self-interaction), existence
of a new, non-equilibrium and strongly anisotropic, type of critical behaviour
(universality class) is established, and the corresponding critical dimensions
are calculated to the leading order of the double expansion in $\xi$ and
$\epsilon=6-d$ (one-loop approximation). The scaling appears strongly
anisotropic in the sense that the critical dimensions related to the directions
parallel and perpendicular to the flow are essentially different.

rotation: the interference of local beams and the spatial depolarization. The
interference takes place in the vortex birth and annihilation events forming
the symmetrical part of the rotation. The depolarization process contributes to
the asymmetry of the rotation that is called the rotational spin Hall effect.
It can be brought to light due to the difference between the envelopes of the

corrupted packets, our codes use information theoretic techniques, rather than
cryptographic primitives. Thus, no secret channel between the senders and the
receivers is required. Second, the encoders in the suggested scheme are
oblivious to the strength of the adversary, yet perform as if its strength was
known in advance. Third, the sparse structure of the codes facilitates
efficient decoding. Finally, the codes easily fit a decentralized scenario with
several sources, when no communication between the sources is allowed.

tackle model selection and parameter estimation problems in a coherent Bayesian
framework, have become increasingly popular in the signal processing literature
since the seminal paper of Andrieu and Doucet (IEEE Trans. Signal Process.,
47(10), 1999). Crucial to the implementation of any RJ-MCMC sampler is the
computation of the so-called Metropolis-Hastings-Green (MHG) ratio, which
determines the acceptance probability for the proposed moves.
  It turns out that the expression of the MHG ratio that was given in the paper
of Andrieu and Doucet for ""Birth-or-Death"" moves---the simplest kind of
trans-dimensional move, used in virtually all applications of RJ-MCMC to signal
decomposition problems---was erroneous. Unfortunately, this mistake has been
reproduced in many subsequent papers dealing with RJ-MCMC sampling in the
signal processing literature.
  This note discusses the computation of the MHG ratio, with a focus on the
case where the proposal kernel can be decomposed as a mixture of simpler
kernels, for which the MHG ratio is easy to compute. We provide sufficient
conditions under which the MHG ratio of the mixture can be deduced from the MHG
ratios of the elementary kernels of which it is composed. As an application, we
consider the case of Birth-or-Death moves, and provide a corrected expression
for the erroneous ratio in the paper of Andrieu and Doucet.

countable set of times $\{t_n\}_{n \in \mathbb N}$ the function $u(t)$ is in
$\mathrm {SBV}$, i.e. its distributional derivative $u_x$ is a measure with no
Cantorian part.
  The proof is based on the decomposition of $u_x(t)$ into waves belonging to
the characteristic families \[ u(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N v_i(t) \tilde r_i(t), \quad
v_i(t) \in \mathcal M(\R), \ \tilde r_i(t) \in \mathrm R^N, \] and the balance
of the continuous/jump part of the measures $v_i$ in regions bounded by

a cancellation of waves or the measure $\mu_{i,\mathrm{jump}}$ is positive.

spectral parameters, we investigate 6 two-dimensional (2D) correlations and 14
derived three-dimensional (3D) correlations of GRBs to explore the possibility
of decreasing the intrinsic scatters of the luminosity relations of GRBs. We
find the 3D correlation of $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ to be
evidently tighter (at the $2 \sigma$ confidence level) than its corresponding
2D correlations, i.e., the $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$L$ and
$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ correlations. In addition, the coefficients before
the logarithms of $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$ in the
$E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ correlation are almost exact
opposites of each other. Inputting this situation as a prior reduces the
relation to $L \propto (E_{\mathrm{peak}}^{'} / \tau_{\mathrm{RT}}^{'})^{0.842
\pm 0.064}$, where $E_{\mathrm{peak}}^{'}$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}^{'}$ denote
the peak energy and minimum rise time in the GRB rest frame. We discuss how our
findings can be interpreted/understood in the framework of the definition of
the luminosity (energy released in units of time). Our argument about the
connection between the luminosity relations of GRBs and the definition of the

leads to the large reduction of the spectral gap via the renormalization
effect, which results in the strong temperature-dependence of the spin Hall
conductivity. We clarify that a quantum phase transition from the TBI to a

fact that the scalar sector needs not to be enlarged, since these operators are
constructed as direct products among scalar multiplets already existing in the
model. There is a unique generic matrix for Youkawa couplings in the neutrino
sector. The charged leptons are already in their diagonal basis. This framework
can lead to a suitable fit of the established phenomenology for the left-handed
neutrinos, while the right-handed neutrino masses come out in the sub-keV
region, independently of the cut-off. The latter introduces in the theory an
intermediate scale (however, more close to GUT than to SM) at about 10^12GeV

D'Alembertian is introduced and by means of a transformation of variables to

the situation of different orders in the time and space derivatives, we adopt
different approaches, as it will become clear throughout the paper. Aspects

technologically and fascinating theoretically. When loaded by external
stresses, their internal strains are governed by correlated motion of internal
structural degrees of freedom. The modelling of such materials is mainly based
on ordered structures, despite existence of auxetic behaviour in disordered
structures and the advantage in manufacturing disordered structures for most
applications. We describe here a first-principles expression for strains in
disordered such materials, based on insight from a family of 'iso-auxetic'
structures. These are structures, consisting of internal structural elements,
which we name 'auxetons', whose inter-element forces can be computed from
statics alone. Iso-auxetic structures make it possible not only to identify the
mechanisms that give rise to auxeticity, but also to write down the explicit
dependence of the strain rate on the local structure, which is valid to all
auxetic materials. It is argued that stresses give rise to strains via two
mechanisms: auxeton rotations and auxeton expansion / contraction. The former
depends on the stress via a local fabric tensor, which we define explicitly for
2D systems. The latter depends on the stress via an expansion tensor. Whether a
material exhibits auxetic behaviour or not depends on the interplay between
these two fields. This description has two major advantages: it applies to any
auxeton-based system, however disordered, and it goes beyond conventional
elasticity theory, providing an explicit expression for general auxetic strains
and outlining the relevant equations.
