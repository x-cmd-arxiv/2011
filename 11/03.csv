radial distribution of binary stars, and the distribution of stellar mass
ratios. We investigated monovariate relations between the fraction of binaries

fraction of binaries in the field, with a few exceptions only. Binary stars are
significantly more centrally concentrated than single MS stars in most of the
clusters studied in this paper. The distribution of the mass ratio is generally
flat (for mass-ratio parameter q>0.5). We found a significant anti-correlation
between the binary fraction in a cluster and its absolute luminosity (mass).
Some, less significant correlation with the collisional parameter, the central
stellar density, and the central velocity dispersion are present. There is no
statistically significant relation between the binary fraction and other
cluster parameters. We confirm the correlation between the binary fraction and
the fraction of blue stragglers in the cluster.

budget to establish links to other players. In our model, each link has unit
price and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its local
diameter or its total distance to other players in the (undirected) underlying

version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the
vertex and other vertices, and in the SUM version, the cost incurred to a
vertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove
that in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding
the best response of a vertex is NP-hard. We take the social cost of the
created network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible
diameter of an equilibrium graph with n vertices in various cases. When the sum
of players' budgets is n-1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we
prove that their maximum diameter is Theta(n) and Theta(log n) in MAX and SUM

link to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either
version is Theta(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the MAX version,
such that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is
Omega(sqrt(log n)). This interesting (and perhaps counter-intuitive) result
shows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium
graphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. Then we prove that every
equilibrium graph in the SUM version has diameter 2^O(sqrt(log n)). Finally, we
show that if the budget of each player is at least k, then every equilibrium

electrodynamics equations in the stationary regime, focusing on the computation
of the Lorentz factor of a space-charge-limited electron flow accelerated in
the polar cap region of a rotating and oscillating pulsar. To this extent, we
adopt the correct expression of the general relativistic Goldreich-Julian
charge density in the presence of toroidal oscillations. Depending on the ratio
of the actual charge density of the pulsar magnetosphere to the
Goldreich-Julian charge density, we distinguish two different regimes of the
Lorentz factor of the particle flow, namely an oscillatory regime produced for
sub-GJ current density configurations, which does not produce an efficient
acceleration, and a true accelerating regime for super-GJ current density
configurations. We find that star oscillations may be responsible for a
significant asymmetry in the pulse profile that depends on the orientation of
the oscillations with respect to the pulsar magnetic field. In particular,
significant enhancements of the Lorentz factor are produced by stellar
oscillations in the super-GJ current density regime.

a two-particle bound state and dual to an operator from the su(2) sector of N=4

the case of states with real momenta. Most importantly, Y_Q-functions exhibit
poles in the analyticity strip which leads to the appearance of new terms in
the formula for the energy of this state. In addition, the TBA equations are
supplied by quantization conditions which involve Y_2. Considering yet another
example of a three-particle state, we find that the corresponding quantization
conditions do not even involve Y_1. Our treatment can be generalized to a wide

the number of ways to represent an integer $m$ by a sum of $n$ squares from a
computational efficiency viewpoint. Although this problem has been studied in
great detail, there are very few formulas given for the purpose of computing
$r_n(m)$ quickly. More precisely, for fixed $n$, we want a formula for $r_n(m)$
that computes in log-polynomial time (with respect to $m$) when the prime
factorization of $m$ is given. Restricting to even $n$, we can view
$\theta_n(q)$, the theta function associated to sums of $n$ squares, as a
modular form of weight $n/2$ on $\Gamma_1(4)$. In particular, we show that for
only a small finite list of $n$ can $\theta_n$ be written as a linear
combination consisting entirely of Eisenstein series and cusp forms with
complex multiplication. These are the only $n$ that give rise to ""elementary""
formulas for $r_n(m)$, i.e. formulas such that for a prime $p$, $r_n(p)$ can be
calculated in $\cO(\log(p))$-time. Viewing $\theta_n(q)$ as one of the simpler
examples of modular forms that are not strictly Eisenstein, this result
motivates the necessity of a log-polynomial time algorithm that directly
calculates the Fourier coefficients of modular forms in the generic situation
when there is no such formula, as described in Couveignes and Edixhoven's
forthcoming book (for level 1 cases) and Peter Bruin's Ph.D. thesis (for higher
level, including 4).

fundamental cancer research and clinical practice. In vitro experiments have
established that the invasive growth of malignant tumors is characterized by
the dendritic invasive branches composed of chains of tumor cells emanating
from the primary tumor mass. The preponderance of previous tumor simulations
focused on non-invasive (or proliferative) growth. The formation of the
invasive cell chains and their interactions with the primary tumor mass and
host microenvironment are not well understood. Here, we present a novel
cellular automaton (CA) model that enables one to efficiently simulate invasive
tumor growth in a heterogeneous host microenvironment. By taking into account a
variety of microscopic-scale tumor-host interactions, including the short-range
mechanical interactions between tumor cells and tumor stroma, degradation of
extracellular matrix by the invasive cells and oxygen/nutrient gradient driven
cell motions, our CA model predicts a rich spectrum of growth dynamics and
emergent behaviors of invasive tumors. Besides robustly reproducing the salient
features of dendritic invasive growth, such as least resistance and intrabranch
homotype attraction, we also predict nontrivial coupling of the growth dynamics
of the primary tumor mass and the invasive cells. In addition, we show that the
properties of the host microenvironment can significantly affect tumor
morphology and growth dynamics, emphasizing the importance of understanding the
tumor-host interaction. The capability of our CA model suggests that
well-developed in silico tools could eventually be utilized in clinical
situations to predict neoplastic progression and propose individualized optimal
treatment strategies.

collect sufficiently wide-field UBVI photometry. The intensive usage of U-band
photometry ensures robust determination of reddening and hence distance for
stars of spectral type earlier than A0, which are well-known spiral arm
tracers. The fields we use are large enough to include in most cases
well-studied Galactic clusters, which we use as bench-marks to assess the

predictions in a broad range of temperatures. Finally, we also show that, again
similarly to the D=3+1 case, the trace of the energy-momentum tensor appears to
be proportional to T^2 in a wide temperature range, starting from approximately
1.2 T_c, where T_c denotes the critical deconfinement temperature.

bands in the flow of yield stress materials. It is a well accepted point of
view that flow in disordered media is occurring via local plastic events,
corresponding to small size rearrangements, that yield a long range stress
redistribution over the system. Within a minimalistic mesoscopic model that
incorporates these local dynamics, we study the spatial organisation of the
local plastic events. The most important parameter in this study is the typical
restructuring time needed to regain the original structure after a local
rearrangement. In agreement with a recent mean field study [Coussot \textit{et
al., Eur. Phys. J. E}, 2010, \textbf{33}, 183] we observe a spontaneous
formation of permanent shear bands, when this restructuring time is large
compared to the typical stress release time in a rearrangement. The bands
consist of a large number of plastic events within a solid region that remains
elastic. This heterogeneous flow behaviour is different in nature from the
transient dynamical heterogeneities that one observes in the small shear rate
limit in flow without shear-banding [Martens \textit{et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.},
2011, \textbf{106}, 156001]. We analyse in detail the dependence of the shear
bands on system size, shear rate and restructuring time. Further we rationalise
the scenario within a mean field version of the spatial model, that produces a
non monotonous flow curve for large restructuring times. This explains the
instability of the homogeneous flow below a critical shear rate, that
corresponds to the minimum of the curve. Our study therefore strongly supports
the idea that the characteristic time scales involved in the local dynamics are
at the physical origin of permanent shear bands.

polynomial time blackbox polynomial identity testing (PIT) that have been
hitherto solved using diverse tools and techniques. In particular, we show that
polynomial time hitting-set generators for identity testing of the two
seemingly different and well studied models - depth-3 circuits with bounded top
fanin, and constant-depth constant-read multilinear formulas - can be
constructed using one common algebraic-geometry theme: Jacobian captures
algebraic independence. By exploiting the Jacobian, we design the first
efficient hitting-set generators for broad generalizations of the
above-mentioned models, namely:
  (1) depth-3 (Sigma-Pi-Sigma) circuits with constant transcendence degree of
the polynomials computed by the product gates (no bounded top fanin
restriction), and (2) constant-depth constant-occur formulas (no multilinear
restriction).
  Constant-occur of a variable, as we define it, is a much more general concept
than constant-read. Also, earlier work on the latter model assumed that the
formula is multilinear. Thus, our work goes further beyond the results obtained
by Saxena & Seshadhri (STOC 2011), Saraf & Volkovich (STOC 2011), Anderson et
al. (CCC 2011), Beecken et al. (ICALP 2011) and Grenet et al. (FSTTCS 2011),

lower bounds for the immanant (which includes permanent and determinant) on the
same depth-3 and depth-4 models for which we give efficient PIT algorithms. Our
results reinforce the intimate connection between identity testing and lower
bounds by exhibiting a concrete mathematical tool - the Jacobian - that is
equally effective in solving both the problems on certain interesting and
previously well-investigated (but not well understood) models of computation.

The
reconnection inflow during the crash phase of sawteeth self-consistently
convects the high pressure core toward the reconnection site, raising the
pressure gradient there. Reconnection shuts off if the diamagnetic drift speed
at the reconnection site exceeds a threshold, which may explain incomplete
reconnection. The relaxation of magnetic shear after reconnection stops may
explain the destabilization of ideal interchange instabilities reported
previously. Proof-of-principle two-fluid simulations confirm this basic
picture. Predictions of the model compare favorably to data from the Mega
Ampere Spherical Tokamak. Applications to transport modeling of sawteeth are
discussed. The results should apply across tokamaks, including ITER.

tends to infinity, resulting intrinsic $M/L$ values quickly converge to fixed
numbers associated to the particulars of the stars in question. When going to
very small stellar populations, the stochastic sampling of the IMF will yield
an inherent spread for the $M/L$ values, which will become probabilistic
quantities. For the recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies,
with total luminosities dropping below 10^3 L_V/L_o, it is important to asses
the amplitude of the probabilistic spread in inherent $M/L$ values. The total
baryonic masses of these systems are usually estimated from their luminosities,
assuming fixed, deterministic $M/L$ values, suitable for the infinite
population limit. These total baryonic masses are crucial for the testing of
structure formation scenarios, as the local ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals
represent the most extreme galactic scales known. Also subject to reliable
$M/L$ values, is the use of these systems as possible discriminants between
dark matter and modified gravity theories. By simulating large collections of
stellar populations, each consisting of a particular collection of individual
stars, we compute statistical distributions for the resulting $M/L$ values. For
total numbers of stars in the range of what is observed for the ultra-faint
dwarf spheroidals, inherent $M/L$ values of stellar populations can be expected
to vary by factors of upwards of 3, interestingly, systematically skewed
towards higher values than what corresponds to the infinite population limit.
This can explain part of the spread in reported baryonic masses for these
systems, which also appear as shifted systematically towards high dark to
baryonic mass ratios at fixed stellar velocity dispersions.

mincut$(S_i, T_j)$, where $S_i \subseteq \{s_1, s_2\}$ and $T_j \subseteq
\{t_1, t_2\}$ for different subsets $S_i$ and $T_j$. Based on these values, we
propose an achievable rate region for this problem based on linear codes.
Towards this end, we begin by defining a base region where both sources are
multicast to both the terminals. Following this we enlarge the region by
appropriately encoding the information at the source nodes, such that terminal
$t_i$ is only guaranteed to decode information from the intended source $s_i$,
while decoding a linear function of the other source. The rate region takes
different forms depending upon the relationship of the different cut values in

extra dark radiation component, while the current evidence from big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN) is more ambiguous. Dark radiation from a decaying
particle can affect these two processes differently. Early decays add an
additional radiation component to both the CMB and BBN, while late decays can
alter the radiation content seen in the CMB while having a negligible effect on
BBN. Here we quantify this difference and explore the intermediate regime by
examining particles decaying during BBN, i.e., particle lifetimes \tau_X
satisfying 0.1 sec < \tau_X < 1000 sec. We calculate the change in the
effective number of neutrino species, N_{eff}, as measured by the CMB, \Delta
N_{CMB}, and the change in the effective number of neutrino species as measured
by BBN, \Delta N_{BBN}, as a function of the decaying particle initial energy
density and lifetime, where \Delta N_{BBN} is defined in terms of the number of
additional two-component neutrinos needed to produce the same change in the
primordial helium-4 abundance as our decaying particle. As expected, for short
lifetimes (\tau_X < 0.1 sec), the particles decay before the onset of BBN, and
\Delta N_{CMB} = \Delta N_{BBN}, while for long lifetimes (\tau_X > 1000 sec),
\Delta N_{BBN} is dominated by the energy density of the nonrelativistic
particles before they decay, so that \Delta N_{BBN} remains nonzero and becomes
independent of the particle lifetime. By varying both the particle energy
density and lifetime, one can obtain any desired combination of \Delta N_{BBN}

by (a) a population of compact, low luminosity (~0.1 L*) sources --- 17
primarily young, small (Re~1-2 kpc), disky galaxies including an obscured AGN
--- that are all substantially offset (>20 kpc) from the line-emitting nebula;
(b) the lack of a central galaxy at or near the peak of the Lya emission; and
(c) several nearly coincident, spatially extended emission components --- Lya,
HeII, and UV continuum --- that are extremely smooth. These morphological
findings are difficult to reconcile with theoretical models that invoke
outflows, cold flows, or resonant scattering, suggesting that while all of
these physical phenomena may be occurring, they are not sufficient to explain
the powering and large extent of Lya nebulae. In addition, although the compact
galaxies within the system are irrelevant as power sources, the region is
significantly overdense relative to the field galaxy population (by at least a
factor of 4). These observations provide the first estimate of the luminosity
function of galaxies within an individual Lya nebula system, and suggest that
large Lya nebulae may be the seeds of galaxy groups or low-mass clusters.

environments of clusters and void centres. While pairs in groups can include
galaxies that are both blue, both red, or one of each color, in the field it is
rare for pair galaxies to both be red. We find that physically bound pairs
closer than 250 h^{-1} kpc tend to have higher sSFRs than the galaxy population
as a whole. However, the sSFR of a bound galaxy relative to galaxies in a
comparable local density environment (determined by the distance to the fifth
nearest neighbor, rho_5), differs depending on the local density. In regions of
high rho_5 the bound population has a higher fraction of star-forming (bluer)
galaxies, whereas there is very little difference between bound and unbound
galaxies in low rho_5 regions. This effect on the star-forming fraction may be
driven by the higher fraction of bound HI-rich galaxies compared to unbound
galaxies, particularly at high local densities. It appears that being in a pair
has an incremental, but not overwhelming, effect on the star formation rate of
the paired galaxies, compared to the more pronounced trend where galaxies
overall have low sSFR (are red) in clusters and higher sSFR (blue) at the

and other excitable cells. Strong electrical coupling synchronizes activity
across cell ensembles. Surprisingly, in the presence of noise synchronous
oscillations generated by an electrically coupled network may differ
qualitatively from the oscillations produced by uncoupled individual cells
forming the network. A prominent example of such behavior is the synchronized
bursting in islets of Langerhans formed by pancreatic \beta-cells, which in
isolation are known to exhibit irregular spiking. At the heart of this
intriguing phenomenon lies denoising, a remarkable ability of electrical
coupling to diminish the effects of noise acting on individual cells.
  In this paper, we derive quantitative estimates characterizing denoising in
electrically coupled networks of conductance-based models of square wave
bursting cells. Our analysis reveals the interplay of the intrinsic properties
of the individual cells and network topology and their respective contributions
to this important effect. In particular, we show that networks on graphs with
large algebraic connectivity or small total effective resistance are better
equipped for implementing denoising. As a by-product of the analysis of
denoising, we analytically estimate the rate with which trajectories converge
to the synchronization subspace and the stability of the latter to random
perturbations. These estimates reveal the role of the network topology in
synchronization. The analysis is complemented by numerical simulations of
electrically coupled conductance-based networks. Taken together, these results
explain the mechanisms underlying synchronization and denoising in an important

photometric galaxy properties as a function of environment, traced by the
galaxy density. We identify group candidates based on galaxy overdensities and
study their galaxy content. We also use available GALEX NUV imaging to identify
strong unobscured star forming galaxies. We find that the large scale structure
around RXJ1347 extends in the NE-SW direction for at least 20 Mpc, in which
most of the group candidates are located. As other studies, we find that the
fraction of blue galaxies (Fblue) is a function of galaxy number density, but
the bulk of the trend is due to galaxies belonging to massive systems. The
fraction of the UV-bright galaxies is also function of environment, but their
relative numbers compared to the blue population seems to be constant
regardless of the environment. These UV emitters also have similar properties
at all galaxy densities, indicating that the transition between galaxy types
occurs in short time-scales. Candidate galaxy groups show a large variation in
their galaxy content and Fblue in those groups display little dependence with
galaxy density. This may indicate possible differences in their evolutionary
status or the processes that are acting in groups are different than in
clusters. The large scale structure around rich clusters are dynamic places for
galaxy evolution. In the case of RXJ1347 the transformation may start within
infalling groups to finish with the removal of the cold gas once galaxies are

diffraction data, vibrational spectra and relaxation rates measured with
solid-state-NMR and quasi-elastic neutron scattering are consistent with
wave-like, rather than particle-like protons. We present a macroscopic-scale
quantum theory for the bonding protons represented by a periodic lattice of
fermions. The adiabatic separation, the exclusion principle, and the
antisymmetry postulate yield a static lattice-state immune to decoherence.
According to the theory of quantum measurements, vibrational spectroscopy and
relaxometry involve realizations of decoherence-free Bloch states for nonlocal
symmetry species that did not exist before the measurement. The eigen states
are fully determined by three temperature-independent parameters which are
effectively measured: the energy difference between tautomer sublattices; the
double-well asymmetry for proton oscillators; the delocalization degree of the
wavefunctions. The spontaneous decay of Bloch states accounts for relaxometry
data. On the other hand, static states realized by elastic scattering account
for diffraction data. We conclude that both quantum and classical physics hold

polynomial identity testing algorithms for depth-3 set-multilinear circuits
(over arbitrary fields). This class of circuits has an efficient,
deterministic, white-box polynomial identity testing algorithm (due to Raz and
Shpilka), but has no known such black-box algorithm. We recast this problem as
a question of finding a low-dimensional subspace H, spanned by rank 1 tensors,
such that any non-zero tensor in the dual space ker(H) has high rank. We obtain
explicit constructions of essentially optimal-size hitting sets for tensors of
degree 2 (matrices), and obtain quasi-polynomial sized hitting sets for
arbitrary tensors (but this second hitting set is less explicit).
  We also show connections to the task of performing low-rank recovery of
matrices, which is studied in the field of compressed sensing. Low-rank
recovery asks (say, over the reals) to recover a matrix M from few
measurements, under the promise that M is rank <=r. We also give a formal
connection between low-rank recovery and the task of sparse (vector) recovery:
any sparse-recovery algorithm that exactly recovers vectors of length n and
sparsity 2r, using m non-adaptive measurements, yields a low-rank recovery
scheme for exactly recovering nxn matrices of rank <=r, making 2nm non-adaptive
measurements. Furthermore, if the sparse-recovery algorithm runs in time \tau,
then the low-rank recovery algorithm runs in time O(rn^2+n\tau). We obtain this
reduction using linear-algebraic techniques, and not using convex optimization,
which is more commonly seen in compressed sensing algorithms. By using a dual
Reed-Solomon code, we are able to (deterministically) construct low-rank
recovery schemes taking 4nr measurements over the reals, such that the
measurements can be all rank-1 matrices, or all sparse matrices.

symmetry, this transition is mediated by a global non-adiabatic instability
that develops on the advection time and reaches non-linear amplitude. Here we
perform high-resolution, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of stalled
supernova shocks with realistic microphysics to analyze this transition. We
find that radial instability is a sufficient condition for runaway expansion if
the neutrinospheric parameters do not vary with time and if heating by the
accretion luminosity is neglected. For a given unstable mode, transition to
runaway occurs when fluid in the gain region reaches positive specific energy.
We find approximate instability criteria that accurately describe the behavior
of the system over a wide region of parameter space. The threshold neutrino
luminosities are in general different than the limiting value for a
steady-state solution. We hypothesize that multidimensional explosions arise
from the excitation of unstable large-scale modes of the turbulent background

steady-state size distribution assuming a single constant velocity dispersion
for all bodies regardless of size. Here we relax this assumption and solve
self-consistently for the bodies' steady-state size and size-dependent velocity
distributions. Specifically, we account for viscous stirring, dynamical
friction, and collisional damping of the bodies' random velocities in addition
to the mass conservation requirement typically applied to find the size
distribution in a steady-state cascade. The resulting size distributions are
significantly steeper than those derived without velocity evolution. For
example, accounting self-consistently for the velocities can change the
standard q=3.5 power-law index of the Dohnanyi (1969) differential size
spectrum to an index as large as q=4. Similarly, for bodies held together by
their own gravity, the corresponding power-law index range 2.88<q<3.14 of Pan &
Sari (2005) can steepen to values as large as q=3.26. Our velocity results
allow quantitative predictions of the bodies' scale heights as a function of

coding over distributed storage. In this setting, a simple separate encoding
strategy known as superposition coding was shown to be optimal in terms of
achieving the minimum sum rate (Roche, Yeung, and Hau, 1997) and the entire
admissible rate region (Yeung and Zhang, 1999) of the problem. The proofs
utilized carefully constructed induction arguments, for which the classical
subset entropy inequality of Han (1978) played a key role. This paper includes
two parts. In the first part the existing optimality proofs for classical SMDC
are revisited, with a focus on their connections to subset entropy
inequalities. First, a new sliding-window subset entropy inequality is
introduced and then used to establish the optimality of superposition coding
for achieving the minimum sum rate under a weaker source-reconstruction
requirement. Second, a subset entropy inequality recently proved by Madiman and
Tetali (2010) is used to develop a new structural understanding to the proof of
Yeung and Zhang on the optimality of superposition coding for achieving the
entire admissible rate region. Building on the connections between classical
SMDC and the subset entropy inequalities developed in the first part, in the
second part the optimality of superposition coding is further extended to the
cases where there is either an additional all-access encoder (SMDC-A) or an
additional secrecy constraint (S-SMDC).

model describes, purely physically, the recently formulated mathematical theory
of ""Twisted Chiral Differential Operators"". This paves the way, via a
generalized T-duality, for a natural physical interpretation of the geometric
Langlands correspondence for simply-connected, simple, complex Lie groups. In
particular, the Hecke eigensheaves and Hecke operators can be described in
terms of the correlation functions of certain operators that underlie the
infinite-dimensional chiral algebra of the flag manifold model. Nevertheless,
nonperturbative worldsheet twisted-instantons can, in some situations,
trivialize the chiral algebra completely. This leads to a spontaneous breaking
of supersymmetry whilst implying certain delicate conditions for the existence
of Beilinson-Drinfeld D-modules. Via supersymmetric gauged quantum mechanics on
loop space, these conditions can be understood to be intimately related to a
conjecture by Hohn-Stolz [1] regarding the vanishing of the Witten genus on
string manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. An interesting connection to
Chern-Simons theory is also uncovered, whence we would be able to (i) relate

larger-than-average variance. The difficult question is how much risk a team
should be willing to accept. This is equivalent to asking how much the team
should be willing to sacrifice from its mean score in order to increase the
score's variance. In this paper a general, analytical method is developed for
addressing this question quantitatively. Under the assumption that every play
in a game is statistically independent, both the mean and the variance of a
team's offensive output can be described using the binomial distribution. This
description allows for direct calculations of the winning probability when a

to change its topology and connections. As a result, the traditional concept of
magnetic fields being frozen into the plasma is no longer applicable. The
diffusion of plasmas and magnetic field is enabled by reconnection and
therefore is termed ""reconnection diffusion"". We explore the consequences of
reconnection diffusion for star formation. In the paper we explain the physics
of reconnection diffusion both from macroscopic and microscopic points of view.
We quantify the reconnection diffusion rate both for weak and strong MHD
turbulence and address the problem of reconnection diffusion acting together
with ambipolar diffusion. In addition, we provide a criterion for correctly
representing the magnetic diffusivity in simulations of star formation. We show
that the role of the plasma effects is limited to ""breaking up lines"" on small
scales and does not affect the rate of reconnection diffusion. We address the
existing observational results and demonstrate how reconnection diffusion can
explain the puzzles presented by observations, in particular, the observed
higher magnetization of cloud cores in comparison with the magnetization of
envelopes. We also outline a possible set of observational tests of the
reconnection diffusion concept and discuss how the application of the new
concept changes our understanding of star formation and its numerical modeling.

neutron star supports a velocity difference of $\sim 10^5$ \cms\ between the
neutron superfluid and the proton-electron fluid as the star spins down. Under
the Magnus force that arises on the vortex array, vortices undergo {\em vortex
creep} through thermal activation or quantum tunneling. We examine the
hydrodynamic stability of this situation. Vortex creep introduces two
low-frequency modes, one of which is unstable above a critical wavenumber for
any non-zero flow velocity of the neutron superfluid with respect to the
charged fluid. For typical pinning parameters of the outer core, the superfluid
flow is unstable over wavelengths $\lambda\lap 10$ m and over timescales of
$\sim (\lambda/{1 m})^{1/2}$ yr down to $\sim 1$ d. The vortex lattice could
degenerate into a tangle, and the superfluid flow would become turbulent. We
suggest that superfluid turbulence could be responsible for the red timing
noise seen in many neutron stars, and find a predicted spectrum that is
generally consistent with observations.

Dramatic changes of Gamma, as well as sign reversal in low-temperature RH and
MR, are also observed across the x~0.1 boundary where the long-range
antiferromagnetic order is suppressed. However, for the system with rich
interstitial excess Fe (y = 0.1), where bulk superconductivity is suppressed
even for x=0.4-0.5, the variations of Gamma, R_H and MR with x are distinct
from those seen in y = 0.02 system: Gamma is ~40 mJ/mol K^2 for 0.1 < x < 0.3,

sample, we examine the role of major mergers in driving star formation at z>1
in a cosmological setting, after validating that some of the key properties of
simulated galaxies are in reasonable agreement with observations, including
luminosity functions, SF history, effective sizes and damped Lyman alpha
systems. We find that major mergers have a relatively modest effect on star
formation, in marked contrast to previous idealized merger simulations of disk
galaxies that show up to two orders of magnitude increase in star formation
rate. At z=2.4-3.7, major mergers tend to increase the specific star formation
rate by 10-25% for galaxies in the entire stellar mass range 10^9-10^12 Msun
probed. Their effect appears to increase with decreasing redshift, but is
capped at 60% at z=1.4-2.4. Two factors may account for this modest effect.
First, SFR of galaxies not in major mergers are much higher at z>1 than local
disk galaxy counterparts. Second, most galaxies at z>1 have small sizes and
contain massive dense bulges, which suppress the merger induced structural
effects and gas inflow enhancement. Various other predictions are also made
that will provide verifiable tests of the model.

coupled double quantum dots where all the relevant effects, such as, the Zeeman
splitting, spin-orbit coupling, valley coupling and electron-electron Coulomb
interaction are explicitly included. In the absence of magnetic field, our
results in single quantum dots agree well with the experiment by Borselli {\em
et al.} [Appl. Phys. Lett. {\bf 98}, 123118 (2011)]. We identify the spin and
valley configurations of the ground state in the experimental cases and give a
complete phase-diagram-like picture of the ground state configuration with
respect to the dot size and valley splitting. We also explicitly investigate
the three-electron energy spectra of the pure and mixed valley configurations
with magnetic fields in both Faraday and Voigt configurations. We find that the
ground state can be switched between doublet and quartet by tuning the magnetic
field and/or dot size. The three-electron energy spectra present many
anticrossing points between different spin states due to the spin-orbit
coupling, which are expected to benefit the spin manipulation. We show that the
negligibly small intervalley Coulomb interaction can result in magnetic-field
independent quartet-doublet degeneracy in the three-electron energy spectrum of
the mixed valley configuration. Furthermore, we study the barrier-width and
barrier-height dependences in vertically coupled double quantum dots with both
pure and mixed valley configurations. Similar to the single quantum dot case,
anticrossing behavior and quartet-doublet degeneracy are observed.

Nevertheless, the complex design and fabrication process, narrow bandwidth, and
high intrinsic losses in the metamaterial-based cloaks have imposed intractable
limitations on their realistic applications. Seeking new approaches to overcome
these perceived disadvantages is in progress. Here by using uniform sapphire

terahertz frequencies. The terahertz invisibility device features a large
concealed volume, low loss, and broad bandwidth. In particular, it is capable
of hiding objects with a dimension nearly an order of magnitude larger than
that of its lithographic counterpart, but without involving complex and
time-consuming cleanroom processing. Such homogenous invisibility cloaks may
lead to novel terahertz photonic devices potentially used in medicine, radars,

intensity fluctuations in the cosmic background light. This contribution needs
to be taken into account as a foreground when using the primordial signal to
constrain cosmological parameters. The extragalactic fluctuations are also
interesting in their own right as they depend on the star formation history of
the Universe and the way in which this connects with the formation of cosmic
structure. We present a new framework which allows us to predict the occupation
of dark matter haloes by star-forming galaxies and uses this information, in
conjunction with an N-body simulation of structure formation, to predict the
power spectrum of intensity fluctuations in the infrared background. We compute
the emission from galaxies at far-infrared, millimetre and radio wavelengths.
Our method gives accurate predictions for the clustering of galaxies both for
the one halo and two halo terms. We illustrate our new framework using a
previously published model which reproduces the number counts and redshift
distribution of galaxies selected by their emission at $850\,\mu$m. Without
adjusting any of the model parameters, the predictions show encouraging
agreement at high frequencies and on small angular scales with recent estimates
of the extragalactic fluctuations in the background made from early data
analysed by the Planck Collaboration. There are, however, substantial
discrepancies between the model predictions and observations on large angular
scales and at low frequencies, which illustrates the usefulness of the
intensity fluctuations as a constraint on galaxy formation models.

novel transmission strategy called structured self-interference cancellation
(or just ""structured cancellation"" for short). In the structured cancellation
strategy the source restrains from transmitting on certain signal levels, and
the relay structures its transmit signal such that it can learn the residual
self-interference channel, and undo the self-interference, by observing the
portion of its own transmit signal that appears at the signal levels left empty
by the source. It is shown that in certain nontrivial regimes, the structured
cancellation strategy outperforms not only half-duplex but also full-duplex
schemes in which time-orthogonal training is used for estimating the residual

effectively infinite-dimensional, similar to the Bethe lattice, but has loops.
We show that these lead to non-trivial corrections to the simple mean-field
behavior. We first determine all normal modes of the coupled springs problem on
this graph, using its large symmetry group. In the thermodynamic limit, the
spectrum is a set of $\delta$-functions, and all the modes are localized. The
fractional number of modes with frequency less than $\omega$ varies as $\exp
(-C/\omega)$ for $\omega$ tending to zero, where $C$ is a constant. For an
unbiased random walk on the vertices of this graph, this implies that the
probability of return to the origin at time $t$ varies as $\exp(- C' t^{1/3})$,
for large $t$, where $C'$ is a constant. For the spherical model, we show that
while the critical exponents take the values expected from the mean-field
theory, the free-energy per site at temperature $T$, near and above the
critical temperature $T_c$, also has an essential singularity of the type
$\exp[ -K {(T - T_c)}^{-1/2}]$.

properties of small objects (0.1-25 m) is described. The objective is to define
a standardized and unambiguous procedure for condensing the drift properties
down to a set of coefficients that may be incorporated into existing stochastic
trajectory forecast models for drifting objects of concern to search and rescue
operations and other activities involving vessels lost at sea such as
containers with hazardous material.
  An operational definition of the slip or wind and wave-induced motion of a
drifting object relative to the ambient current is proposed. This definition
taken together with a strict adherence to 10 m wind speed allows us to refer
unambiguously to the leeway of a drifting object. We recommend that all objects
if possible be studied using what we term the direct method, where the object's
leeway is studied directly using an attached current meter.
  We divide drifting objects into four categories, depending on their size. For
the smaller objects (less than 0.5 m), an indirect method of measuring the
object's motion relative to the ambient current must be used. For larger
objects, direct measurement of the motion through the near-surface water masses
is strongly recommended. Larger objects are categorized according to the
ability to attach current meters and wind monitoring systems to them.
  The leeway field method proposed here is illustrated with results from field
work where three objects were studied in their distress configuration; a 1:3.3
sized model of a 40-ft Shipping container, a World War II mine and a 220 l

""small system"") undergoing repeated interactions with a chain of identical
small pieces (called ""environment""). This physical setup constitutes an
advantageous way of implementing dissipation for classical systems, it is at
the same time Hamiltonian and Markovian. This kind of model has already been
studied in the context of quantum mechanical systems, where it was shown to
give rise to quantum Langevin equations in the limit of continuous time
interactions ([2]), but it has never been considered for classical mechanical
systems yet. The aim of this article is to compute the continuous limit of
repeated interactions for classical systems and to prove that they give rise to
particular stochastic differential equations in the limit. In particular we
recover the usual Langevin equations associated to the action of heat baths. In
order to obtain these results, we consider the discrete-time dynamical system
induced by Hamilton's equations and the repeated interactions. We embed it into
a continuous-time dynamical system and we compute the limit when the time step
goes to 0. This way we obtain a discrete-time approximation of stochastic
differential equation, considered as a deterministic dynamical system on the
Wiener space, which is not exactly of the usual Euler scheme type. We prove the
Lp and almost sure convergence of this scheme. We end up with applications to
concrete physical exemples such as a charged particule in an uniform electric
field or a harmonic interaction. We obtain the usual Langevin equation for the
action of a heat bath when considering a damped harmonic oscillator as the

single spin asymmetries for the production of forward $\pi^0$ mesons from
polarized proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 200 GeV. To disentangle
contributions to measured forward asymmetries one has to look beyond inclusive
$\pi^0$ production to the production of forward jets or direct photons. In
2006, STAR with the Forward Pion Detector++ (FPD++) in place, collected 6.8
pb$^{-1}$ of forward data with an average polarization of 60%. FPD++ had
sufficient acceptance for ""jet-like"" objects, which are clustered responses of
an electromagnetic calorimeter primarily sensitive to incident photons,
electrons and positrons. For these objects, the angle of the outgoing leading
$\pi^0$ with respect to the fragmenting parton was reconstructed, thus enabling
us to disentangle the contributions to the forward $\pi^0$ asymmetries. The
simulated data set shows that on average there are approximately 2.5
fragmenting mesons per one ""jet-like"" object, making them reasonably ""jetty"".
Preliminary results provide no evidence of measured contributions to the
asymmetry from jet fragmentation, implying the Sivers distribution functions
play a substantial role in producing the large inclusive forward $\pi^0$
asymmetries. A similar effort was made in the mid-rapidity $(|\eta|<1)$ region
of the STAR detector, where 2.2 pb$^{-1}$ of data was collected. We present
progress made by making measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry of leading

located is highly complex due to the uncertainties in drift properties and
environmental forcing (wind, waves and surface currents). Usually the origin is
inferred by running a trajectory model (stochastic or deterministic) in
reverse. However, this approach has some severe drawbacks, most notably the
fact that many drifting objects go through nonlinear state changes underway
(e.g., evaporating oil or a capsizing lifeboat). This makes it difficult to
naively construct a reverse-time trajectory model which realistically predicts
the earliest possible time the object may have started drifting. We propose
instead a different approach where the original (forward) trajectory model is
kept unaltered while an iterative seeding and selection process allows us to
retain only those particles that end up within a certain time-space radius of
the observation. An iterative refinement process named BAKTRAK is employed
where those trajectories that do not make it to the goal are rejected and new
trajectories are spawned from successful trajectories. This allows the model to
be run in the forward direction to determine the point of origin of a drifting
object. The method is demonstrated using the Leeway stochastic trajectory model
for drifting objects due to its relative simplicity and the practical
importance of being able to identify the origin of drifting objects. However,
the methodology is general and even more applicable to oil drift trajectories,
drifting ships and hazardous material that exhibit non-linear state changes
such as evaporation, chemical weathering, capsizing or swamping. The
backtracking method is tested against the drift trajectory of a life raft and
is shown to predict closely the initial release position of the raft and its
subsequent trajectory.

physics effects in the top quark sector. We study some of the recently proposed
polarisation observables involving the decay products of the top quark in the
context of $H^-t$ and $Wt$ production. We show that the effect of the top
polarisation on the decay lepton azimuthal angle distribution, studied recently
for these processes at leading order in QCD, is robust with respect to the
inclusion of next-to-leading order and parton shower corrections. We also
consider the leptonic polar angle, as well as recently proposed energy-related
distributions of the top decay products. We construct asymmetry parameters from
these observables, which can be used to distinguish the new physics signal from
the $Wt$ background and discriminate between different values of $\tan\beta$
and $m_{H^-}$ in a general type II two-Higgs doublet model. Finally, we show
that similar observables may be useful in separating a Standard Model $Wt$
signal from the much larger QCD induced top pair production background.

provided increasing evidence against local realistic theories. However, there
still remains the crucial challenge of simultaneously closing all major
loopholes - the locality, freedom-of-choice, and detection loopholes - in a
single experiment. An important sub-class of local realistic theories can be
tested with the concept of ""steering"". The term steering was introduced by
Schr\""odinger in 1935 for the fact that entanglement would seem to allow an
experimenter to remotely steer the state of a distant system as in the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument. Einstein called this ""spooky action at
a distance"". EPR-Steering has recently been rigorously formulated as a quantum
information task opening it up to new experimental tests. Here, we present the
first loophole-free demonstration of EPR-steering by violating three-setting
quadratic steering inequality, tested with polarization entangled photons
shared between two distant laboratories. Our experiment demonstrates this
effect while simultaneously closing all loopholes: both the locality loophole
and a specific form of the freedom-of-choice loophole are closed by having a
large separation of the parties and using fast quantum random number
generators, and the fair-sampling loophole is closed by having high overall
detection efficiency. Thereby, we exclude - for the first time loophole-free -
an important class of local realistic theories considered by EPR. As well as
its foundational importance, loop-hole-free steering also allows the
distribution of quantum entanglement secure from an untrusted party.

in the mean wave period. ERA-40 is biased low in wind speed and significant
wave height, a bias which is not reproduced by the downscaling. The atmospheric
downscaling also reproduces polar lows, which can not be resolved by ERA-40,

scheduling problem. We consider the online scenario where a sequence of $n$
jobs has to be scheduled non-preemptively on $m$ machines so as to minimize the
maximum completion time of any job. The best competitive ratio that can be
achieved by deterministic online algorithms is in the range $[1.88,1.9201]$.
Currently no randomized online algorithm with a smaller competitiveness is
known, for general $m$.
  In this paper we explore the power of job migration, i.e.\ an online
scheduler is allowed to perform a limited number of job reassignments.
Migration is a common technique used in theory and practice to balance load in
parallel processing environments. As our main result we settle the performance
that can be achieved by deterministic online algorithms. We develop an
algorithm that is $\alpha_m$-competitive, for any $m\geq 2$, where $\alpha_m$
is the solution of a certain equation. For $m=2$, $\alpha_2 = 4/3$ and
$\lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} \alpha_m = W_{-1}(-1/e^2)/(1+ W_{-1}(-1/e^2))
\approx 1.4659$. Here $W_{-1}$ is the lower branch of the Lambert $W$ function.
For $m\geq 11$, the algorithm uses at most $7m$ migration operations. For
smaller $m$, $8m$ to $10m$ operations may be performed. We complement this
result by a matching lower bound: No online algorithm that uses $o(n)$ job
migrations can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than $\alpha_m$. We finally
trade performance for migrations. We give a family of algorithms that is
$c$-competitive, for any $5/3\leq c \leq 2$. For $c= 5/3$, the strategy uses at
most $4m$ job migrations. For $c=1.75$, at most $2.5m$ migrations are used.

Spitzer/IRS spectra of a low-mass Class 0 object, NGC 1333 IRAS 4B, has
previously been attributed to the envelope-disk accretion shock but could
instead be produced in an outflow. As part of the survey of low-mass sources in

Herschel/PACS to obtain a far-IR spectrum and several Nyquist-sampled spectral
images with to determine the origin of excited H2O emission from NGC 1333 IRAS
4B. The spectrum has high signal-to-noise in a rich forest of H2O, CO, and OH
lines, providing a near-complete census of far-IR molecular emission from a
Class 0 protostar. The excitation diagrams for the three molecules all require
fits with two excitation temperatures, indicating the presence of two physical
components. The highly excited component of H2O emission is characterized by
subthermal excitation of 1500 K gas with a density of 10^5 - 10^7 cm-3,
conditions that also reproduce the mid-IR H2O emission detected by Spitzer. On
the other hand, a high density, low temperature gas can reproduce the H2O
spectrum observed by Spitzer but underpredicts the H2O lines seen by Herschel.
Nyquist-sampled spectral maps of several lines show two spatial components of
H2O emission, one centered at 1200 AU south of the central source at the
position of the blueshifted outflow lobe and a second centered on-source. Both
spatial components of the far-IR H2O emission are consistent with emission from
the outflow. The gas cooling from the IRAS 4B envelope cavity walls is
dominated by far-IR H2O emission, in contrast to stronger [O I] and CO cooling
from more evolved protostars. [one sentence truncated]

phase transition from a linear to a zigzag structure with decreasing transverse
confinement. We derive the low energy effective theory of the transition
showing that in presence of quantum fluctuations the Zigzag phase can be
characterized by a long ranged string order, while the local Ising correlations
decay as a power law. This is also confirmed using DMRG calculations on a
microscopic model. The non local order in the bulk gives rise to zero energy
states localized at the interface between the ordered and disordered phases.
Such an interface naturally arises when the particles are subject to a weak
harmonic confinement along the tube axis. We compute the signature of the edge
states in the single particle tunneling spectra pointing to differences between
a system with bosonic versus fermionic particles. Finally we asses the
magnitude of the relevant quantum fluctuations in realistic systems of dipolar
particles, including ultracold polar molecules as well as alkali atoms weakly
dressed by a Rydberg excitation.

strength, the system undergoes stepwise transitions between different ground
states, which we describe by analytical trial wave functions, amongst them the
Pfaffian, the Laughlin, and a Laughlin quasiparticle many-body state. The
adiabatic following of the center of mass movement by the lowest energy dressed
internal state, is lost by the mixing of the second internal state. This
mixture can be controlled by the intensity of the laser field. The
non-adiabaticity is inherent to the considered setup, and is shown to play the
role of circular asymmetry. We study its influence on the properties of the
ground state of the system. Its main effect is to reduce the overlap of the
numerical solutions with the analytical trial expressions by occupying states
with higher angular momentum. Thus, we propose generalized wave functions
arising from the Laughlin and Pfaffian wave function by including components,
where extra Jastrow factors appear, while preserving important features of
these states. We analyze quasihole excitations over the Laughlin and
generalized Laughlin states, and show that they possess effective fractional
charge and obey anyonic statistics. Finally, we study the energy gap over the

  Constant Retries",,,,"RI11023","cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Balanced allocation of online balls-into-bins has long been an active area of
research for efficient load balancing and hashing applications.There exists a
large number of results in this domain for different settings, such as parallel
allocations~\cite{parallel}, multi-dimensional allocations~\cite{multi},
weighted balls~\cite{weight} etc. For sequential multi-choice allocation, where
$m$ balls are thrown into $n$ bins with each ball choosing $d$ (constant) bins
independently uniformly at random, the maximum load of a bin is $O(\log \log n)
+ m/n$ with high probability~\cite{heavily_load}. This offers the current best
known allocation scheme. However, for $d = \Theta(\log n)$, the gap reduces to
$O(1)$~\cite{soda08}.A similar constant gap bound has been established for
parallel allocations with $O(\log ^*n)$ communication rounds~\cite{lenzen}.
  In this paper we propose a novel multi-choice allocation algorithm,
\emph{Improved D-choice with Estimated Average} ($IDEA$) achieving a constant
gap with a high probability for the sequential single-dimensional online
allocation problem with constant $d$. We achieve a maximum load of $\lceil m/n
\rceil$ with high probability for constant $d$ choice scheme with
\emph{expected} constant number of retries or rounds per ball. We also show
that the bound holds even for an arbitrary large number of balls, $m>>n$.
Further, we generalize this result to (i)~the weighted case, where balls have
weights drawn from an arbitrary weight distribution with finite variance,
(ii)~multi-dimensional setting, where balls have $D$ dimensions with $f$
randomly and uniformly chosen filled dimension for $m=n$, and (iii)~the
parallel case, where $n$ balls arrive and are placed parallely in the bins. We
show that the gap in these case is also a constant w.h.p. (independent of $m$)
for constant value of $d$ with expected constant number of retries per ball.

exchange currents. These calculations can be carried out only with due regard
for realistic NN and 3N forces between nucleons and also, with the use of exact
methods of solving the many-body problem. In this technique it is expedient to
conduct investigations of nuclear reactions as from few-nucleon systems in the
energy area of the particles below the meson-producing threshold. The tensor
part of NN interaction and 3NF,s generate the lightest nuclei states with
nonzero orbital momenta of nucleons. These states in the lightest nuclei is

excitation of localized surface plasmons that make them attractive candidates
for highly sensitive bionanosensors. The underlying physical principle is
either an analyte-induced modification of the dielectric properties of the
medium surrounding the nanoparticle or an increase of the excitation and
emission rates of an optically active analyte by the resonantly enhanced
plasmon field. Either way, besides the nanoparticle geometry the dielectric
properties of the metal and nanoscale surface roughness play an important role
for the sensing performance. As the underlying principles are however not yet
well understood, we aim here at an improved understanding by analyzing the
optical characteristics of lithographically fabricated nanoparticles with
different crystallinity and roughness parameters. We vary these parameters by
thermal annealing and apply a thin gold film as a model system to retrieve
modifications in the dielectric function. We investigate, on one hand,
extinction spectra that reflect the far-field properties of the plasmonic
excitation and, on the other hand, surface-enhanced Raman spectra that serve as
a near-field probe. Our results provide improved insight into localized surface
plasmons and their application in bionanosensing.

quantities are both dependent on the measurement settings considered, and in
this paper we show that there are measurement bases which allow for an optimal
situation in this trade-off relation. These bases are given as a generalization

sensitive to the geometry of the pulsar magnetic field. Pulsar magnetic field
geometries, such as the retarded vacuum dipole and force-free magnetospheres
have distorted polar caps that are offset from the magnetic axis in the
direction opposite to rotation. Since this effect is due to the sweepback of
field lines near the light cylinder, offset polar caps are a generic property
of pulsar magnetospheres and their effects should be included in gamma-ray
pulsar light curve modeling. In slot gap models (having two-pole caustic
geometry), the offset polar caps cause a strong azimuthal asymmetry of the
particle acceleration around the magnetic axis. We have studied the effect of
the offset polar caps in both retarded vacuum dipole and force-free geometry on
the model high-energy pulse profiles. We find that, compared to the profiles
derived from symmetric caps, the flux in the pulse peaks, which are caustics
formed along the trailing magnetic field lines, increases significantly
relative to the off-peak emission, formed along leading field lines. The
enhanced contrast produces improved slot gap model fits to Fermi pulsar light

environments at intermediate redshift (0.3<z<0.8) for two mass-limited galaxy
samples. We use the IMACS Cluster Building Survey (ICBS), at masses M_ast
>10^(10.5) M_sun, to study cluster, group, and field galaxies at z=0.3-0.45,
and the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS), at masses M_ast > 10^(10.2) M_sun,
to investigate cluster and group galaxies at z=0.4-0.8. Therefore, in our
analysis we include galaxies that are slightly less massive than the Milky Way.
Having excluded the brightest cluster galaxies, we show thatthe shape of the
mass distribution does not seem to depend on global environment. Our two main
results are: (1) Galaxies in the virialized regions of clusters, in groups, and
in the field follow a similar mass distribution. (2) Comparing both ICBS and
EDisCS mass functions to mass functions in the local Universe, we find
evolution from z~0.4-0.6 to z~0.07. The population of low-mass galaxies has
proportionally grown with time with respect to that of massive galaxies. This
evolution is independent of environment -- the same for clusters and the field.
Furthermore, considering only clusters, we find that no differences can be
detected neither within the virialized regions, nor when we compare galaxies
within and outside the virial radius. Subdividing galaxies in terms of color,
in clusters, groups, and field red and blue galaxies are regulated by different
mass functions, but comparing separately the blue and red mass functions in
different environments, no differences are detected in their shape.

important only at low masses (log M_ast/M_sun <10.1 in WINGS and log

pre-main sequence (PMS) star candidates actively undergoing mass accretion and
estimate their stellar properties and mass accretion rate (Macc). Our
measurements represent the largest Macc dataset of low-metallicity stars
presented so far. As such, they offer a unique opportunity to study on a
statistical basis the mass accretion process in the LMC and, more in general,
the evolution of the mass accretion process around low-metallicity stars. We
find that the typical \dot{M} of PMS stars in the LMC is higher than for
galactic PMS stars of the same mass, independently of their age. Taking into
account the caveats of isochronal age and \dot{M} estimates, the difference in
Macc between the LMC and our Galaxy appears to be about an order of magnitude.
We review the main mechanisms of disk dispersal and find indications that
typically higher Macc are to be expected in low-metallicity environments.
However, many issues of this scenario need to be clarified by future
observations and modeling. We also find that, in the mass range 1-2 M_sun, the
Macc of PMS stars in the LMC increases with stellar mass as
\dot{M}acc\proptoM^b, with b \approx1, i.e. slower than the second power low

star formation, one projected across 0.1 pc on the sky and another one at about
2000 AU from a ZAMS star of about 38 Solar masses. This young stellar object
drives a powerful jet- and wind-driven outflow system with the water masers
associated to the outflow walls, previously detected as a limb-brightened
cavity in the NIR band. At about 1300 AU to the north of this object a younger
protostar drives two bow shocks, outlined by arc-like water maser emission, at
200 AU either side of the source. We have traced the velocity profile of the
gas that expands along these arc-like maser structures and compared it with the
jet-driven outflow model. This analysis suggests that the ambient medium around
the northern protostar is swept up by a jet-driven shock (>66 km/s) and perhaps
a lower-velocity (~10 km/s) wind with an opening angle of about 20 degrees from
the jet axis.

Universe, observed to emerge from very different astrophysical systems - from
active galactic nuclei down to young brown dwarf stars. Even with the huge span
in spatial scales, there is convincing evidence that the physics at the origin
of the phenomenon, namely the acceleration and collimation mechanisms, is the
same in all classes of jets. Here we report on the discovery of a giant,
highly-collimated jet from Sanduleak's star in the Large Magellanic Cloud

represents the largest stellar jet ever discovered, and the first resolved
stellar jet beyond the Milky Way. The kinematics and extreme chemical
composition of the ejecta from Sanduleak's star bear strong resemblance with
the low-velocity remnants of SN1987A and with the outer filaments of the most
famous supernova progenitor candidate, i.e., eta Carinae. Moreover, the precise
knowledge of the jet's distance implies that it will be possible to derive
accurate estimates of most of its physical properties. Sanduleak's bipolar
outflow will thus become a crucial test-bed for future theoretical modeling of

Similar facts hold for supercompact, measurable and strongly Ramsey cardinals.
If a cardinal is supercompact up to a weakly iterable cardinal, then there is
an inner model of the Proper Forcing Axiom and another inner model with a
supercompact cardinal in which GCH+V=HOD holds. Under the same hypothesis,
there is an inner model with level by level equivalence between strong

compact-extended objects. Less than 15% of these MIPSGAL bubbles (MBs) are
known and identified as evolved stars. We present Spitzer observations of 4 MBs
obtained with the InfraRed Spectrograph to determine the origin of the mid-IR
emission. We model the mid-IR gas lines and the dust emission to infer physical
conditions within the MBs and consequently their nature. Two MBs show a
dust-poor spectrum dominated by highly ionized gas lines of [\ion{O}{4}],
[\ion{Ne}{3}], [\ion{Ne}{5}], [\ion{S}{3}] and [\ion{S}{4}]. We identify them
as planetary nebulae with a density of a few 10$^3\ \rm{cm^{-3}}$ and a central
white dwarf of $\gtrsim 200,000$ K. The mid-IR emission of the two other MBs is
dominated by a dust continuum and lower-excitation lines. Both of them show a
central source in the near-IR (2MASS and IRAC) broadband images. The first
dust-rich MB matches a Wolf-Rayet star of $\sim 60,000$ K at 7.5 kpc with dust
components of $\sim170$ and $\sim1750$ K. Its mass is about $10^{-3}\
\rm{M_\odot}$ and its mass loss is about $10^{-6}\ \rm{M_\odot/yr}$. The second
dust-rich MB has recently been suggested as a Be/B[e]/LBV candidate. The gas
lines of [\ion{Fe}{2}] as well as hot continuum components ($\sim300$ and
$\sim1250$ K) arise from the inside of the MB while its outer shell emits a
colder dust component ($\sim75$ K). The distance to the MB remains highly
uncertain. Its mass is about $10^{-3}\ \rm{M_\odot}$ and its mass loss is about
$10^{-5}\ \rm{M_\odot/yr}$.

distributed computing platform that leverages the combined resources of
multiple processors or machines. In a discrete event driven simulation, the
assignment of logical processes (LPs) to machines is a critical step that
affects the computational and communication burden on the machines, which in
turn affects the simulation execution time of the experiment. We study a
network partitioning game wherein each node (LP) acts as a selfish player. We
derive two local node-level cost frameworks which are feasible in the sense
that the aggregate state information required to be exchanged between the
machines is independent of the size of the simulated network model. For both
cost frameworks, we prove the existence of stable Nash equilibria in pure
strategies. Using iterative partition improvements, we propose game theoretic
partitioning algorithms based on the two cost criteria and show that each
descends in a global cost. To exploit the distributed nature of the system, the
algorithm is distributed, with each node's decision based on its local
information and on a few global quantities which can be communicated
machine-to-machine. We demonstrate the performance of our partitioning
algorithm on an optimistic discrete event driven simulation platform that
models an actual parallel simulator.

We
calculate the average X-ray spectrum during the gamma-ray active periods. Then,
we calculate spectra from Compton scattering of a photon beam into a given
direction by isotropic relativistic electrons with a power-law distribution,
both based on the Klein-Nishina cross section and in the Thomson limit.
Applying the results to scattering of stellar blackbody radiation in the inner
jet of Cyg X-3, we find that a low-energy break in the electron distribution at
a Lorentz factor of ~ 300--1000 is required by the shape of the observed
X-ray/gamma-ray spectrum in order to avoid overproducing the observed X-ray
flux. The electrons giving rise to the observed \g-rays are efficiently cooled
by Compton scattering, and the power-law index of the acceleration process is ~
2.5--3. The bulk Lorentz factor of the jet and the kinetic power before the
dissipation region depend on the fraction of the dissipation power supplied to
the electrons; if it is ~ 1/2, the Lorentz factor is ~ 2.5, and the kinetic
power is ~ 10^38 erg/s, which represents a firm lower limit on the jet power,
and is comparable to the bolometric luminosity of Cyg X-3. Most of the power
supplied to the electrons is radiated. The broad band spectrum constrains the
synchrotron and self-Compton emission from the gamma-ray emitting electrons,
which requires the magnetic field to be relatively weak, with the magnetic
energy density < a few times 10^-3 of that in the electrons. The actual value
of the magnetic field strength can be inferred from a future simultaneous
measurement of the IR and gamma-ray fluxes.

literature have focused on mere contact and intercontact characteristics to
make forwarding decisions. Nevertheless, there is a world behind contacts: just
because one node is not in contact with some potential destination, it does not
mean that this node is alone. There may be interesting end-to-end transmission
opportunities through other nearby nodes. Existing protocols miss such
possibilities by maintaining a simple contact-based view of the network. In
this paper, we investigate how the vicinity of a node evolves through time and
whether such information can be useful when routing data. We observe a clear
tradeoff between routing performance and the cost for monitoring the
neighborhood. Our analyses suggest that limiting a node's neighborhood view to
three or four hops is more than enough to significantly improve forwarding

nucleons, on the transition density $\rho_{t}$ and pressure $P_{t}$ at the
inner edge separating the liquid core from the solid crust of neutron stars.
Three methods, i.e., the thermodynamical approach, the curvature matrix
approach and the Vlasov equation approach are used to determine the transition
density $\rho_{t}$ with the Skyrme effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. We
find that the $\rho_{t}$ and $P_{t}$ depend on not only the ratio of coupling
strength to mass squared of the $U$-boson $g^{2}/\mu ^{2}$ but also its mass
$\mu $ due to the finite range interaction from the $U$-boson exchange. In
particular, our results indicate that the $\rho_{t}$ and $P_{t}$ are sensitive
to both $g^{2}/\mu ^{2}$ and $\mu $ if the $U$-boson mass $\mu $ is larger than
about 2 MeV. Furthermore, we show that both $g^{2}/\mu ^{2}$ and $\mu $ can
have significant influence on the mass-radius relation and the crustal fraction
of total moment of inertia of neutron stars. In addition, we study the exchange
term contribution of the $U$-boson based on the density matrix expansion
method, and demonstrate that the exchange term effects on the nuclear matter
equation of state as well as the $\rho_{t}$ and $P_{t}$ are generally
negligible.

considering positivity and full additivity constraints. Simulated data based on
the measured spectral signatures, is used for evaluating the proposed

0$) fluid may provide an almost scale invariant spectrum for the gravitational
scalar perturbations. As the universe contracts, the amplitude of such
perturbations are amplified. The gauge invariant variable $\Phi$ develops a
growing mode which becomes much larger than the constant one around the bounce
phase. The constant mode has its amplitude fixed by Cosmic Background Explorer
(COBE) normalization, thus the amplitude of the growing mode can become much
larger than 1. In this paper, we first show that this is a general feature of
bouncing models, since we expect that general relativity should be valid in all
scales away from the bounce. However, in the Newtonian gauge, the variable
$\Phi$ gives the value of the metric perturbation $\phi$, raising doubts on the
validity of the linear perturbative regime at the bounce. In order to address
this issue, we obtain a set of necessary conditions for the perturbative series
to be valid along the whole history of the model, and we show that there is a
gauge in which all these conditions are satisfied, for a set of models, if the
constant mode is fixed by COBE normalization. As a by-product of this analysis,
we point out that there are sets of solutions for the perturbation variables
where some gauge-fixing conditions are not well defined, turning these gauges
prohibited for those solutions.

It is argued that the EKT is not restricted to many-electron systems but holds
for any finite many-body system, provided the interaction vanishes for
increasing interparticle distance. A necessary and sufficient condition for the

with well-known partitions of the electron density over AIM basins, either with
sharp or with fuzzy boundaries. The method is applied to a test set of about 50

contrast to the case of periodic forcing, new type of strange nonchaotic (SN)
oscillating states (that are geometrically strange but have no positive
Lyapunov exponents) are found to exist between the regular and chaotic
oscillating states as intermediate ones. Their strange fractal geometry leads
to aperiodic ""complex"" spikings. Various dynamical routes to SN oscillations
