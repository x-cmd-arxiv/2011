observations during the '90s and they have been recently confirmed by the data
of the Fermi satellite. These results have, however, shown that a fully
satisfactory interpretative framework of the GRB phenomena is still lacking.
The MAGIC telescope opens the possibility to extend the measurement of GRBs in
the several tens up to hundreds of GeV energy range. From the theoretical point
of view, both leptonic and hadronic processes have been suggested to explain
the possible GeV/TeV counterpart of GRBs. Observations with ground-based
telescopes of very high energy photons (E>30 GeV) from these sources are going
to play a key role in discriminating among the different proposed emission
mechanisms which are barely distinguishable at lower energies. MAGIC telescope
observations of the GRB090102 (z=1.547) field from 03:14:52 UT to 06:54:01 UT
are analyzed to derive upper limits to the GeV/TeV emission. We compare these
results to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in the
framework of the standard fireball model. The results we obtained are
compatible with the expected emission but cannot yet set further constraints on
the theoretical scenario. However, the difficulty in modeling the low energy
data for this event makes it difficult to fix in an unambiguous way the
physical parameters which describe the fireball. Nonetheless, the MAGIC
telescope, thanks to its low energy threshold and fast repositioning, is
opening for the first time the possibility to fill the energy gap between
space-based gamma detectors and the ground-based measurements. This will makes
possible GRBs multiwavelength studies in the very high energy domain.

place an upper limit on the difference between the spin and orbital

anticipated to host numerous dark matter subhalos with masses between 10^{10}

matter scenarios, these objects could be visible in the gamma-ray band as faint

realistic subhalo models and current observational constraints on
self-annihilating dark matter, we predict that about one massive Galactic
subhalo may have already been detected in the 11-months catalog of Fermi-LAT
data (1FGL). Selection cuts applied to the 1FGL reveal twelve possible
candidates, and in-depth studies of the most promising object, 1FGL
J0030.7+0724, are presented. In a dedicated X-ray follow-up observation with
the Swift XRT, seven point-like X-ray sources have been discovered. Within the
positional uncertainty derived from the 24-months Fermi-LAT data, we consider
the unidentified radio source NVSS J003119+072456, coinciding with one of the
discovered Swift sources, as the most promising counterpart candidate for 1FGL
J0030.7+0724. The broad-band spectral energy distribution is consistent with a
high-energy-peaked blazar. However, flux and extent of the Fermi source may
also be compatible with a dark matter subhalo. A discrimination between the two
scenarios requires further multi-wavelength observations. Strategies for

centre of a typical nearby galaxy disrupts a Solar-type star every ~ 10^5
years, resulting in a bright flare lasting for months. Sgr A*, the resident
SMBH of the Milky Way, produces (by comparison) tiny flares that last only
hours but occur daily. Here we explore the possibility that these flares could
be produced by disruption of smaller bodies - asteroids. We show that asteroids
passing within an AU of Sgr A* could be split into smaller fragments which then
vaporise by bodily friction with the tenuous quiescent gas accretion flow onto
Sgr A*. The ensuing shocks and plasma instabilities may create a transient
population of very hot electrons invoked in several currently popular models
for Sgr A* flares, thus producing the required spectra. We estimate that
asteroids larger than ~ 10 km in size are needed to power the observed flares,
with the maximum possible luminosity of the order 10^39 erg s^-1. Assuming that
the asteroid population per parent star in the central parsec of the Milky Way
is not too dissimilar from that around stars in the Solar neighbourhood, we
estimate the asteroid disruption rates, and the distribution of the expected
luminosities, finding a reasonable agreement with the observations. We also
note that planets may be tidally disrupted by Sgr A* as well, also very
infrequently. We speculate that one such disruption may explain the putative
increase in Sgr A* luminosity ~ 300 yr ago.

mechanical system that, contrary to a common belief, kept theoreticians busy
from the end of 1920s to (at least) mid 1940s. Starting by the well-known works
by Klein-Gordon and Dirac, we then give an account of the main results achieved
by a variety of different authors, ranging from de Broglie to Proca, Majorana,
Fierz-Pauli, Kemmer, Rarita-Schwinger and many others.
  A particular interest comes out for the general problem of the description of
particles with \textit{arbitrary} spin, introduced (and solved) by Majorana as
early as 1932, and later reconsidered, within a different approach, by Dirac in
1936 and by Fierz-Pauli in 1939. The final settlement of the problem in 1945 by
Bhabha, who came back to the general ideas introduced by Majorana in 1932, is
discussed as well, and, by making recourse also to unpublished documents by
Majorana, we are able to reconstruct the line of reasoning behind the Majorana
and the Bhabha equations, as well as its evolution. Intriguingly enough, such
an evolution was \textit{identical} in the two authors, the difference being
just the period of time required for that: probably few weeks in one case
(Majorana), while more than ten years in the other one (Bhabha), with the
contribution of several intermediate authors.
  Majorana's paper of 1932, in fact, contrary to the more complicated
Dirac-Fierz-Pauli formalism, resulted to be very difficult to fully understand
(probably for its pregnant meaning and latent physical and mathematical
content): as is clear from his letters, even Pauli (who suggested its reading
to Bhabha) took about one year in 1940-1 to understand it. This just testifies
for the difficulty of the problem, and for the depth of Majorana's reasoning
and results.

that the switching field distribution corresponds to a probability density
function and can be obtained by solving a master equation for the not-switching
probability together with the transition rate for the magnetization according
to the Arrhenius-N\'eel Law. By calculating the first and second moments of the
probability density function we succeed in modeling rate-dependent coercivity
and the standard deviation of the coercive field. Complementary to the
analytical approach, we also present a Monte Carlo simulation for the switching
of a macrospin, which allows us to account for the field dependence of the
attempt frequency. The results show excellent agreement with results from a
Langevin dynamics simulation and therefore point out the importance to include
the relevant dependencies in the attempt frequency. However, we conclude that
the N\'eel-Brown model fails to predict switching fields correctly for common
field rates and material parameters used in magnetic recording from the loss of
normalization of the probability density function. Investigating the transition
regime between thermally assisted and dynamic switching will be of future
interest regarding the development of new magnetic recording technologies.

phenomenological models with artificial viscosity/strain gradient effect, for

our variational analysis, we require that the mean vector of the unknowns over
one period be in the elliptic region with respect to the corresponding pure

through the link between the action functional for the traveling-wave ODE and
the relative mechanical energy for the time-evolutionary system. Finally, we
show that spectral implies modulational nonlinear stability by using a change

the occurrence of such fields in sdB stars with T_eff < 30000K, whose

predictions for hadron form factors in a broad range of momentum transfers. To
probe the accuracy of this approximate method, we consider, in parallel to QCD,
a potential model: in this case, the exact form factors may be calculated from
the solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation and confronted with the results
from the quantum-mechanical LD sum rule. On the basis of our quantum-mechanical
analysis we conclude that the LD sum rule is expected to give reliable
predictions for $F_\pi(Q^2)$ and $F_{\pi\gamma}(Q^2)$ in the region $Q^2 \ge
5-6$ GeV$^2$. Moreover, the accuracy of the method improves rather fast with
growing $Q^2$ in this region. For the pion elastic form factor, the data at
small $Q^2$ indicate that the LD limit may be reached already at relatively low
values of momentum transfers, $Q^2\approx 4-8$ GeV$^2$; we therefore conclude
that large deviations from LD in the region $Q^2=20-50$ GeV$^2$ reported in
some recent theoretical analyses seem unlikely. The data on the
($\eta,\eta')\to\gamma\gamma^*$ form factors meet very well the expectations
from the LD model. Surprisingly, the {\sc BaBar} results for the
$\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma^*$ form factor imply a violation of LD growing with $Q^2$

for the general understanding of B-type star formation in binary systems. The

and membership in binary and multiple systems is supported by our observations

found that all components are chemically peculiar with different abundance

single large dipole located close to the centre of the star. The presence of
magnetic fields in the atmospheres of HgMn stars has been demonstrated in

infinite graphs with finite degree. Ground states are spin configurations that
locally minimize the EA Hamiltonian on each finite set of vertices. A problem
with far-reaching consequences in mathematics and physics is to determine the
number of ground states for the model on Z^d for any d. This problem can be
seen as the spin glass version of determining the number of infinite geodesics
in first-passage percolation or the number of ground states in the disordered
ferromagnet. It was recently shown by Newman, Stein and the two authors that,
on the half-plane Z \times N, there is a unique ground state (up to global
flip) arising from the weak limit of finite-volume ground states for a
particular choice of boundary conditions. In this paper, we study the entire
set of ground states on the infinite graph, proving that the number of ground
states on the half-plane must be two (related by a global flip) or infinity.
This is the first result on the entire set of ground states in a non-trivial
dimension. In the first part of the paper, we develop tools of interest to
prove the analogous result on Z^d.

From a new set of such EELRs, we present evidence that the AGN in many Seyfert
galaxies undergo luminous episodes 20,000-200,000 years in duration. Motivated
by the discovery of the spectacular nebula known as Hanny's Voorwerp, ionized
by a powerful AGN which has apparently faded dramatically within ~ 100,000
years, Galaxy Zoo volunteers have carried out both targeted and serendipitous
searches for similar emission-line clouds around low-redshift galaxies.We
present the resulting list of candidates and describe spectroscopy identifying
19 galaxies with AGN-ionized regions at projected radii > 10 kpc. This search
recovered known EELRs and identified additional previously unknown cases, one
with detected emission to r = 37 kpc. At least 14/19 are in interacting or
merging systems; tidal tails are a prime source of extraplanar ionized gas. We
see a mix of one- and two-sided structures, with observed cone angles from
23-112 degrees. We consider the energy balance in the ionized clouds, with
lower and upper bounds on ionizing luminosity from recombination and
ionization-parameter arguments, and estimate the luminosity of the core from
the far-infrared data. The implied ratio of ionizing radiation seen by the
clouds to that emitted by the nucleus, for a constant nuclear source, ranges
from 0.02 to > 12; 7/19 exceed unity. Small values imply heavily obscured AGN.
However, large values may require that the AGN has faded over tens of thousands
of years, giving us several examples of systems in which such dramatic
long-period variation has occurred; this is the only current technique for
addressing these timescales in AGN history. (Abridged)

considerations of natural electroweak symmetry breaking show that higgsinos,
stops, and the gluino should not be too far above the weak scale. The rest of
the spectrum, including the squarks of the first two generations, can be
heavier and beyond the current LHC reach. We have used collider simulations to
determine the limits that all of the 1/fb searches pose on higgsinos, stops,
and the gluino. We find that stops and the left-handed sbottom are starting to
be constrained and must be heavier than about 200-300 GeV when decaying to
higgsinos. The gluino must be heavier than about 600-800 GeV when it decays to
stops and sbottoms. While these findings point toward scenarios with a lighter
third generation split from the other squarks, we do find that moderately-tuned
regions remain, where the gluino is just above 1 TeV and all the squarks are
degenerate and light. Among all the searches, jets plus missing energy and
same-sign dileptons often provide the most powerful probes of natural SUSY.
Overall, our results indicate that natural SUSY has survived the first 1/fb of
data. The LHC is now on the brink of exploring the most interesting region of

collective coherence between noise-induced neural spikings) in an inhibitory
population of subthreshold neurons (which cannot fire spontaneously without
noise). This stochastic spiking coherence may be well visualized in the raster
plot of neural spikes. For a coherent case, partially-occupied ""stripes""
(composed of spikes and indicating collective coherence) are formed in the
raster plot. This partial occupation occurs due to ""stochastic spike skipping""
which is well shown in the multi-peaked interspike interval histogram. The main
purpose of our work is to quantitatively measure the degree of stochastic
spiking coherence seen in the raster plot. We introduce a new spike-based
coherence measure $M_s$ by considering the occupation pattern and the pacing
pattern of spikes in the stripes. In particular, the pacing degree between
spikes is determined in a statistical-mechanical way by quantifying the average
contribution of (microscopic) individual spikes to the (macroscopic)
ensemble-averaged global potential. This ""statistical-mechanical"" measure $M_s$
is in contrast to the conventional measures such as the ""thermodynamic"" order
parameter (which concerns the time-averaged fluctuations of the macroscopic
global potential), the ""microscopic"" correlation-based measure (based on the
cross-correlation between the microscopic individual potentials), and the
measures of precise spike timing (based on the peri-stimulus time histogram).
In terms of $M_s$, we quantitatively characterize the stochastic spiking
coherence, and find that $M_s$ reflects the degree of collective spiking
coherence seen in the raster plot very well. Hence, the
""statistical-mechanical"" spike-based measure $M_s$ may be used usefully to
quantify the degree of stochastic spiking coherence in a statistical-mechanical
way.

spectra of the Halpha nebulae in the cool cores of 9 galaxy clusters. This
sample provides a wealth of information on the ionization state, kinematics,
and reddening of the warm gas in the cool cores of galaxy clusters. We find
evidence for only small amounts of reddening in the extended, line-emitting
filaments, with the majority of filaments having E(B-V) < 0.2. The combination
of [O III]/Hb, [N II]/Ha, [S II]/Ha, and [O I]/Ha allow us to rule out
collisional ionization by cosmic rays, thermal conduction, and photoionization
by ICM X-rays and AGN as strong contributors to the ionization of the warm gas
in both nuclei and filaments. The data are adequately described by a composite
model of slow shocks and star formation. This model is further supported by an
observed correlation between the linewidths and low ionization line ratios
which becomes stronger in systems with more modest star formation activity
based on far ultraviolet observations. We find that the more extended, narrow
filaments tend to have shallower velocity gradients and narrower linewidths
than the compact filamentary complexes. We confirm that the widths of the
emission lines decrease with radius, from FWHM \sim 600 km/s in the nuclei to
FWHM ~ 100 km/s in the most extended filaments. We suggest that this radial
dependence of the velocity width may in fact be linked to ICM turbulence and,
thus, may provide a glimpse into the amount of turbulence in cool cores. In the
central regions (r < 10 kpc) of several systems the warm gas shows kinematic
signatures consistent with rotation. We find that the kinematics of the most
extended filaments in this sample are broadly consistent with both infall and
outflow, and recommend further studies linking the warm gas kinematics to both
radio and X-ray maps in order to further understand the observed kinematics.

sample of ten long duration radio transients reported by Bower and others.
These transients have an implied all-sky rate that would make them the most
common radio transient in the sky and yet most have no quiescent counterparts
at other wavelengths and therefore no known progenitor (other than Galactic
neutron stars). We find that more than half of these transients are due to rare
data artifacts. The remaining sources have lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
than initially reported by 1 to 1.5-sigma. This lowering of SNR matters greatly
since the sources are at the threshold. We are unable to decisively account for
the differences. By two orthogonal criteria one source appears to be a good
detection. Thus the rate of long duration radio transients without optical
counterparts is, at best, comparable to that of the class of recently
discovered Swift J1644+57 nuclear radio transients. We revisit the known and
expected classes of long duration radio transients and conclude that the
dynamic radio sky remains a rich area for further exploration. Informed by the
experience of past searches for radio transients, we suggest that future
surveys pay closer attention to rare data errors and ensure that a wealth of
sensitive multi-wavelength data be available in advance of the radio
observations and that the radio searches should have assured follow-up
resources.

populations in z>\sim1.5 cluster environments show first evidence for drastic
changes on the high-mass end of galaxies and signs for a gradual disappearance

opaque to the photo-dissociating ultraviolet, creating an environment abundant

scenario. We then narrow down the vast parameter space by considering the
pre-explosion survivability of such a clump as well as the cross-section
necessary for sufficient enrichment. We employ numerical simulations to address
the mixing of the radioactively enriched SN gas with the pre-existing gas and
the forced collapse within 20kyr. We show that a cold clump of 10Msun at a
distance of 5pc can be sufficiently enriched in 26Al and triggered into
collapse fast enough - within 18kyr after encountering the supernova shock -
for a range of different metallicities and progenitor masses, even if the
enriched material is assumed to be distributed homogeneously in the entire

Selected Areas, in which we have measured accurate PMs to faint magnitudes in
40x40 arcmin fields evenly spaced across the sky. The radial velocity (RV)
signature of Sgr has been identified among our follow-up spectroscopic data in
four of the six fields and combined with mean PMs of
spectroscopically-confirmed members to derive space motions of Sgr debris based
on 15-64 confirmed stream members per field. These kinematics are compared to
predictions of the Law & Majewski (2010) model of Sgr disruption; we find
reasonable agreement with model predictions in RVs and PMs along Galactic
latitude. However, an upward adjustment of the Local Standard of Rest velocity
Theta_LSR from its standard 220 km/s to at least $232\pm14$ km/s (and possibly
as high as $264\pm23$ km/s) is necessary to bring 3-D model debris kinematics

simultaneously reproduce known position, distance, and radial velocity trends
of the Sgr tidal streams, while significantly increasing Theta_LSR}, could only
be achieved by increasing the Galactic bulge and disk mass while leaving the
dark matter halo fixed to the best-fit values from Law & Majewski (2010). We
derive low-resolution spectroscopic abundances along this stretch of the Sgr
stream and find a constant [Fe/H] = -1.15 (with ~0.5 dex scatter in each field
-- typical for dwarf galaxy populations) among the four fields with reliable
measurements. A constant metallicity suggests that debris along the ~60-degree

between liquid fractional-quantum-Hall-effect (FQHE) states and Wigner-solid
states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) in the neighborhood of nu=1/3. Liquid
characteristics of the FQHE states are associated with the symmetry-conserving
rotations and vibrations of the electron molecule. Although the electron
densities of the symmetry-conserving LLL states do not exhibit crystalline
patterns, the intrinsic crystalline correlations are reflected in the
conditional probability distributions and the emergence of cusp yrast states in
the LLL spectra. It is shown that away from the exact fractional fillings, weak
pinning perturbations (due to weak disorder) may overcome the energy gaps
between adjacent global states and generate pinned broken symmetry ground
states as a superposition of symmetry-conserving LLL states with different
total angular momenta. The electron densities of such mixed states (without
good angular momentum quantum numbers) exhibit oscillating patterns that
correspond to molecular crystallites. These pinned Wigner crystallites
represent finite-size precursors of the bulk Wigner-solid state. It is further
shown that the emergence of these molecular crystallites is a consequence of
the presence of RVEM components in the symmetry-conserving LLL states. In
addition, it is shown that the RVEM approach accounts for the Wigner-solid
state in the neighborhood of nu=1, which was also found in the experiments. We
utilize results for sizes in a wide range from N=6 to N=29 electrons, and we

information processing is the realization of active spatio-temporal control of
light on the nanoscale. The use of phase-shaped pulses or beams enforces
specific requirements for on-chip integration and imposes strict design
limitations. We introduce here an alternative approach, which is based on
exploiting the strong sub-wavelength spatial phase modulation in the near-field
of resonantly-excited high-Q optical microcavities integrated into plasmonic
nanocircuits. Our theoretical analysis reveals the formation of areas of
circulating powerflow (optical vortices) in the near-fields of optical
microcavities, whose positions and mutual coupling can be controlled by tuning
the microcavities parameters and the excitation wavelength. We show that
optical powerflow though nanoscale plasmonic structures can be dynamically
molded by engineering interactions of microcavity-induced optical vortices with
noble-metal nanoparticles. The proposed strategy of re-configuring plasmonic
nanocircuits via locally-addressable photonic elements opens the way to develop
chip-integrated optoplasmonic switching architectures, which is crucial for
implementation of quantum information nanocircuits.

bolometric luminosity during the saturated phase of coronal emission decreases
from 10^-3.1 for late K-dwarfs to 10^-4.3 for early F-type stars (across the

  We apply our X-ray emission - age relations to the investigation of the
evaporation history of 121 known transiting exoplanets using a simple
energy-limited model of evaporation and taking into consideration Roche lobe
effects and different heating/evaporation efficiencies. We confirm that a
linear cut-off of the planet distribution in the M^2/R^3 versus a^-2 plane is
an expected result of population modification by evaporation and that the known
transiting exoplanets display such a cut-off. We find that for an evaporation
efficiency of 25% we expect around 1 in 10 of the known transiting exoplanets
to have lost > 5% of their mass since formation. In addition we provide
estimates of the minimum formation mass for which a planet could be expected to
survive for 4 Gyrs for a range of stellar and planetary parameters.
  We emphasise the importance of the earliest periods of a planet's life for
its evaporation history with 75% expected to occur within the first Gyr. This
raises the possibility of using evaporation histories to distinguish between
different migration scenarios. For planets with available spin-orbit angles no
difference is found between the distributions of planets with misaligned orbits
and those with aligned orbits. This suggests that misalignment occurs early in
the life of the planetary system, though more data is needed.

communicating with information providers while having to wait time for
responses. Here the waiting time can be considered as cost. We show that the
optimal choice of the waiting time under uncertainty gives rise to the bursty

allows the nodes to cooperate and diffuse information in real-time; it also
helps alleviate the effects of stochastic gradient noise and measurement noise

performance of the algorithm in some detail, including its transient and
steady-state behavior. We also apply the diffusion algorithm to two problems:
distributed estimation with sparse parameters and distributed localization.
Compared to well-studied incremental methods, diffusion methods do not require
the use of a cyclic path over the nodes and are robust to node and link
failure. Diffusion methods also endow networks with adaptation abilities that
enable the individual nodes to continue learning even when the cost function
changes with time. Examples involving such dynamic cost functions with moving

weak magnetic field is found to render the flow linearly unstable as two weak
jets appear close to the centre of the duct at the Hartmann number Ha \approx
9.6. In a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the instability following the
jets becomes confined in the layers of characteristic thickness \delta \sim
Ha^{-1/2} located at the walls parallel to the magnetic field. In this case the
instability is determined by \delta, which results in both the critical
Reynolds and wavenumbers numbers scaling as \sim \delta^{-1}. Instability modes
can have one of the four different symmetry combinations along and across the

of vorticity along the magnetic field. These two modes represent strongly
non-uniform vortices aligned with the magnetic field, which rotate either in
the same or opposite senses across the magnetic field. The former enhance while
the latter weaken one another provided that the magnetic field is not too
strong or the walls parallel to the field are not too far apart. In a strong

resolution adapted to Max-SAT, are proved in a novel and simple way via an
integer programming transformation. With the aim of finding out how powerful
the inference rules are in practice, we have developed a new Max-SAT solver,
called MaxSatz, which incorporates those rules, and performed an experimental
investigation. The results provide empirical evidence that MaxSatz is very
competitive, at least, on random Max-2SAT, random Max-3SAT, Max-Cut, and Graph

paradigm as its starting point. Despite their manifest attractions, speech-act
models of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for
communication in artificial agent systems. In particular, it has proved to be
extremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speech-act based agent
communication languages. In part, the problem is that speech-act semantics
typically make reference to the ""mental states"" of agents (their beliefs,
desires, and intentions), and there is in general no way to attribute such
attitudes to arbitrary computational agents. In addition, agent programming
languages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract, stand-alone
versions, neglecting aspects such as communication primitives. With respect to
communication, implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather
ad hoc. This paper addresses both of these problems, by giving semantics to
speech-act based messages received by an AgentSpeak agent. AgentSpeak is a
logic-based agent programming language which incorporates the main features of
the PRS model of reactive planning systems. The paper builds upon a structural
operational semantics to AgentSpeak that we developed in previous work. The
main contributions of this paper are as follows: an extension of our earlier
work on the theoretical foundations of AgentSpeak interpreters; a
computationally grounded semantics for (the core) performatives used in
speech-act based agent communication languages; and a well-defined extension of
AgentSpeak that supports agent communication.

resolution approaches --- where related references are resolved jointly ---
have been shown to be more accurate than independent attribute-based resolution
for off-line entity resolution, we focus on developing new algorithms for
collective resolution for answering entity resolution queries at query-time.
For this purpose, we first formally show that, for collective resolution,
precision and recall for individual entities follow a geometric progression as
neighbors at increasing distances are considered. Unfolding this progression
leads naturally to a two stage expand and resolve query processing strategy. In
this strategy, we first extract the related records for a query using two novel
expansion operators, and then resolve the extracted records collectively. We
then show how the same strategy can be adapted for query-time entity resolution
by identifying and resolving only those database references that are the most
helpful for processing the query. We validate our approach on two large
real-world publication databases where we show the usefulness of collective
resolution and at the same time demonstrate the need for adaptive strategies
for query processing. We then show how the same queries can be answered in
real-time using our adaptive approach while preserving the gains of collective
resolution. In addition to experiments on real datasets, we use synthetically
generated data to empirically demonstrate the validity of the performance
trends predicted by our analysis of collective entity resolution over a wide

understanding complex systems is through the use of mathematical models.
Typically, this has come to mean the identification of quantitative models
expressed as differential equations. Quantitative modelling works best when the
structure of the model (i.e., the form of the equations) is known; and the
primary concern is one of estimating the values of the parameters in the model.
For complex biological systems, the model-structure is rarely known and the
modeler has to deal with both model-identification and parameter-estimation. In
this paper we are concerned with providing automated assistance to the first of
these problems. Specifically, we examine the identification by machine of the
structural relationships between experimentally observed variables. These
relationship will be expressed in the form of qualitative abstractions of a
quantitative model. Such qualitative models may not only provide clues to the
precise quantitative model, but also assist in understanding the essence of
that model. Our position in this paper is that background knowledge
incorporating system modelling principles can be used to constrain effectively
the set of good qualitative models. Utilising the model-identification
framework provided by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) we present empirical
support for this position using a series of increasingly complex artificial
datasets. The results are obtained with qualitative and quantitative data
subject to varying amounts of noise and different degrees of sparsity. The
results also point to the presence of a set of qualitative states, which we
term kernel subsets, that may be necessary for a qualitative model-learner to
learn correct models. We demonstrate scalability of the method to biological
system modelling by identification of the glycolysis metabolic pathway from

that when photo-z uncertainty is taken into account the requirements on the
level of precision in the prediction for the matter power spectrum are more
stringent than previously thought. Including degree-scale galaxy clustering
statistics in a joint analysis with weak lensing not only strengthens the
survey's constraining power by ~20%, but can also have a profound impact on the
calibration demands, decreasing the degradation in dark energy constraints with
matter power spectrum uncertainty by a factor of 2-5. Similarly, using galaxy

then becomes a search in the much smaller space of subgraph configurations.
Once an abstract plan is found, it can be quickly resolved into a correct (but

prove that this technique is sound and complete and demonstrate its practical
effectiveness on a real map.

switch workers between the rooms in order to cope with changing customer
demand. Assuming stochastic customer arrival and service times, we seek a
policy for switching workers such that the expected customer waiting time is
minimized while the expected back room staffing is sufficient to perform all
work. Three novel constraint programming models and several shaving procedures
for these models are presented. Experimental results show that a model based on
closed-form expressions together with a combination of shaving procedures is
the most efficient. This model is able to find and prove optimal solutions for
many problem instances within a reasonable run-time. Previously, the only
available approach was a heuristic algorithm. Furthermore, a hybrid method
combining the heuristic and the best constraint programming method is shown to
perform as well as the heuristic in terms of solution quality over time, while
achieving the same performance in terms of proving optimality as the pure
constraint programming model. This is the first work of which we are aware that
solves such queueing-based problems with constraint programming.

prior to the start of the main observing campaign, our dataset covers a total
duration of 4.5 months. During this time, Mrk 50 was highly variable,
exhibiting a maximum variability amplitude of a factor of 4 in the U-band
continuum and a factor of 2 in the H-beta line. Using standard
cross-correlation techniques, we find that H-beta and H-gamma lag the V-band
continuum by tau_cen = 10.64(-0.93,+0.82) and 8.43(-1.28,+1.30) days,
respectively, while the lag of He II 4686 is unresolved. The H-beta line
exhibits a symmetric velocity-resolved reverberation signature with shorter
lags in the high-velocity wings than in the line core, consistent with an
origin in a broad-line region dominated by orbital motion rather than infall or
outflow. Assuming a virial normalization factor of f=5.25, the virial estimate
of the black hole mass is (3.2+-0.5)*10^7 solar masses. These observations
demonstrate that Mrk 50 is among the most promising nearby active galaxies for
detailed investigations of broad-line region structure and dynamics.

making problems, because it treats uncertainty in sensing and acting in a
principled way. In single-agent frameworks like MDPs and POMDPs, planning can
be carried out by resorting to Q-value functions: an optimal Q-value function
Q* is computed in a recursive manner by dynamic programming, and then an
optimal policy is extracted from Q*. In this paper we study whether similar
Q-value functions can be defined for decentralized POMDP models (Dec-POMDPs),
and how policies can be extracted from such value functions. We define two
forms of the optimal Q-value function for Dec-POMDPs: one that gives a
normative description as the Q-value function of an optimal pure joint policy
and another one that is sequentially rational and thus gives a recipe for
computation. This computation, however, is infeasible for all but the smallest
problems. Therefore, we analyze various approximate Q-value functions that
allow for efficient computation. We describe how they relate, and we prove that
they all provide an upper bound to the optimal Q-value function Q*. Finally,
unifying some previous approaches for solving Dec-POMDPs, we describe a family
of algorithms for extracting policies from such Q-value functions, and perform
an experimental evaluation on existing test problems, including a new

decentralized Markov decision problem. Many real-life distributed problems that
arise in manufacturing, multi-robot coordination and information gathering
scenarios can be formalized using this framework. However, finding the optimal
solution in the general case is hard, limiting the applicability of recently
developed algorithms. This paper provides a practical approach for solving
decentralized control problems when communication among the decision makers is
possible, but costly. We develop the notion of communication-based mechanism
that allows us to decompose a decentralized MDP into multiple single-agent
problems. In this framework, referred to as decentralized semi-Markov decision
process with direct communication (Dec-SMDP-Com), agents operate separately
between communications. We show that finding an optimal mechanism is equivalent
to solving optimally a Dec-SMDP-Com. We also provide a heuristic search
algorithm that converges on the optimal decomposition. Restricting the
decomposition to some specific types of local behaviors reduces significantly
the complexity of planning. In particular, we present a polynomial-time
algorithm for the case in which individual agents perform goal-oriented
behaviors between communications. The paper concludes with an additional
tractable algorithm that enables the introduction of human knowledge, thereby
reducing the overall problem to finding the best time to communicate. Empirical
results show that these approaches provide good approximate solutions.

demonstrated to produce state of the art performance on certain state spaces.
However, previous applications were restricted to state spaces with special
properties, which precludes disjoint pattern databases from being defined for
several commonly used testbeds, such as Rubiks Cube, TopSpin and the Pancake
puzzle. In this paper we give a general definition of additive abstractions
that can be applied to any state space and prove that heuristics based on
additive abstractions are consistent as well as admissible. We use this new
definition to create additive abstractions for these testbeds and show
experimentally that well chosen additive abstractions can reduce search time
substantially for the (18,4)-TopSpin puzzle and by three orders of magnitude
over state of the art methods for the 17-Pancake puzzle. We also derive a way
of testing if the heuristic value returned by additive abstractions is provably

metric corresponds to the minimum energy that a vehicle requires to move from
one point to another in the flow environment, and the resulting partition can
be used by the vehicles in cooperative control tasks such as task assignment

Voronoi regions, we determine a subset (or lower bound) and superset (or upper
bound) of an agent's Voronoi neighbors. We then show that, via simulations, the
upper bound is tight and its cardinality remains bounded as the number of

of finite value is investigated. A classical simple fluid with a locally
introduced field imitating a permeable solid is considered. The cases of micro-
and macroscopically smooth boundary are examined and the analysis of static
membranes is performed. Henry constant of adsorption and its connection with
Henry constant of absorption, specific surface grand potential (gamma) and the
surface number density are determined. High-temperature expansions and
low-temperature limit for basic values are obtained. ""The surface tension
coefficient"" decomposes into a value proportional to Henry constant of
adsorption depending on the position of the separating surface, and a universal
nonlinear surface coefficient. Two approaches to this problem are analyzed:
through the surface cluster expansion and through the pressure tensor. Within
the first approach, the series in powers of activity is obtained for gamma.
This expression is similar to the cluster expansion for pressure but in
contrast to this case the integrals of Ursell factors contain the multipliers
depending on the potential of particles interaction with the external field.
Within the second approach, Kirkwood-Buff formula for gamma is extended for the
case of the field of finite value. A complete identity of the approaches of
""cluster expansion"" and ""pressure tensor"" is demonstrated, and the near-surface
virial expansion which determines the exact equation of state of the
""two-dimensional"" gas of the near-surface region is constructed. Coincidence of
pressure acting on a transverse wall and the tangential component of pressure
tensor, both averages over the transition layer as well as the symmetry of the

next present two examples of how this DF scheme may be combined with the
linearity of lattice codes to achieve new rate regions which for some channel

the basic unit of computation in the nervous system. The spiking response of
the neuron to a complex, time-varying input can be predicted from the detailed
biophysical properties of the neuron, modeled as a deterministic nonlinear
dynamical system. In the tradition of neural coding, however, a neuron or
neural system is treated as a black box and statistical techniques are used to
identify functional models of its encoding properties. The goal of this work is
to connect the mechanistic, biophysical approach to neuronal function to a
description in terms of a coding model. Building from preceding work at the
single neuron level, we develop from first principles a mathematical theory
mapping the relationships between two simple but powerful classes of models:
deterministic integrate-and-fire dynamical models and linear-nonlinear coding
models. To do so, we develop an approach for studying a nonlinear dynamical
system by conditioning on an observed linear estimator. We derive asymptotic
closed-form expressions for the linear filter and estimates for the nonlinear
decision function of the linear/nonlinear model. We analytically derive the
dependence of the linear filter on the input statistics and we show how
deterministic nonlinear dynamics can be used to modulate the properties of a
probabilistic code. We demonstrate that integrate-and-fire models without any
additional currents can perform perfect contrast gain control, a sophisticated
adaptive computation, and we identify the general dynamical principles
responsible. We then design from first principles a nonlinear dynamical model
that implements gain control. While we focus on the integrate-and-fire models
for tractability, the framework we propose to relate LN and dynamical models
generalizes naturally to more complex biophysical models.

to the 2D materials was studied using the graphene 2D honeycomb two sublattice
as an example. It is found that introducing NNN to the 2D materials removes the
symmetry around the Fermi level and shifts it, at a small value of NNN hopping.
This effect increases with increasing NNN hopping. If the NNN hopping becomes
competitive with nearest neighbor (NN) hopping, the dispersion relations of the
2D materials changes completely from NN hopping dispersion relations. The
results show that the 2D material sensitivity for NNN hopping effect is much
larger in the 2D honeycomb lattice than 2D square lattice. This is due to the
fact that the number of NNN sites is equal to six, which is the double of NN
sites in the 2D honeycomb lattice. Meanwhile, the number of NNN sites is equal
to four which is equal to NN sites in 2D square lattice. We therefore conclude
that by changing the ratio between NNN and NN sites in the 2D lattice one can
tune the sensitivity for NNN hopping effects.

theory (NEGF-DFT) modeling of independent electron and phonon transport in
nanojunctions with applications focused on a new class of thermoelectric
devices where a single molecule is attached to two metallic zigzag graphene
nanoribbons (ZGNRs) via highly transparent contacts. Such contacts make
possible injection of evanescent wavefunctions from ZGNRs, so that their
overlap within the molecular region generates a peak in the electronic
transmission. Additionally, the spatial symmetry properties of the transverse
propagating states in the ZGNR electrodes suppress hole-like contributions to
the thermopower. Thus optimized thermopower, together with diminished phonon
conductance through a ZGNR/molecule/ZGNR inhomogeneous structure, yields the
thermoelectric figure of merit ZT~0.5 at room temperature and 0.5<ZT<2.5 below
liquid nitrogen temperature. The reliance on evanescent mode transport and
symmetry of propagating states in the electrodes makes the
electronic-transport-determined power factor in this class of devices largely
insensitive to the type of sufficiently short conjugated organic molecule,
which we demonstrate by showing that both 18-annulene and C10 molecule
sandwiched by the two ZGNR electrodes yield similar thermopower. Thus, one can
search for molecules that will further reduce the phonon thermal conductance
(in the denominator of ZT) while keeping the electronic power factor (in the
nominator of ZT) optimized. We also show how often employed Brenner empirical
interatomic potential for hydrocarbon systems fails to describe phonon
transport in our single-molecule nanojunctions when contrasted with

larger energy of protons than gamma-rays. However, the keV-GeV flat spectra
detected in GRB 090902B is well explained with a comparable energy in protons

(AGNs) and study the nature of low-luminosity AGNs in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. This is the first part of a series of papers and we develop a new,
sensitive method to identify AGNs in this paper. An emission line luminosity in
a spectrum is a sum of a star formation component and an AGN component (if
present). We demonstrate that an accurate estimate of the star formation
component can be achieved by fitting model spectra, generated with a recent
stellar population synthesis code, to a continuum spectrum. By comparing the
observed total line luminosity with that attributed to star formation, we can
tell whether a galaxy host an AGN or not. We compare our method with the
commonly used emission line diagnostics proposed by Baldwin et al. (1981;
hereafter BPT). Our method recovers the same star formation/AGN classification
as BPT for 85% of the strong emission line objects, which comprise 43% of our
sample. A unique feature of our method is its sensitivity: it is applicable to
78% of the sample. We further make comparisons between our method and BPT using
stacked spectra and selection in X-ray and radio wavelengths. We show that,
while the method suffers from incompleteness and contamination as any AGN
identification methods do, it is overall a sensitive method to identify AGNs.
Another unique feature of the method is that it allows us to subtract emission
line luminosity due to star formation and extract intrinsic AGN luminosity. We
will make a full use of these features to study the nature of low-luminosity
AGNs in Paper-II.

activities and host galaxy properties. Based on a sample of AGNs identified
with the new method developed in Paper-I, we find that AGNs typically show
extinction of tau_V=1.2 and they exhibit a wide range of ionization levels. The
latter finding motivates us to use [OII]+[OIII] luminosity as an indicator of
AGN power. We find that AGNs are preferentially located in massive, red,
early-type galaxies. By carefully taking into account a selection bias of the
Oxygen-excess method, we show that strong AGNs are located in actively star
forming galaxies and rapidly growing super-massive black holes are located in
rapidly growing galaxies, which clearly shows the co-evolution of super-massive
black holes and the host galaxies. This is a surprising phenomenon given that
the growths of black holes and host galaxies occur at very different physical
scales. Interestingly, the AGN power does not strongly correlate with the host
galaxy mass. It seems that mass works like a 'switch' to activate AGNs. The
absence of AGNs in low-mass galaxies might be due the absence of super-massive
black holes in those galaxies, but a dedicated observation of nuclear region of
nearby low-mass galaxies would be necessarily to obtain deeper insights into
it.

for viscoelastic fluid (the Leonov model) flow, we investigate strong nonlinear
behavior in 2D creeping contraction flow. The algorithm is applicable in the
whole range of the retardation parameter. In the analysis of steady solutions,
there exists upper convergence limit of available numerical solutions in this
contraction flow that is free from the frustrating mesh dependence when we
incorporate the tensor-logarithmic formulation [Fattal and Kupferman, JNNFM,
2004]. With adjustment of a nonlinear parameter, 2 kinds of fluid have been
chosen for flow modeling such as highly shear thinning and Boger-type liquids.
According to the type of such property, the transient modeling has revealed
distinct flow dynamics of elastic instability. With pressure difference imposed
slightly below the steady limit, the result demonstrates fluctuating solution
without approaching steady state for the shear thinning fluid. From it, we
conclude that the existence of upper limit for convergent steady solution
possibly implies transition to spatially as well as temporally varying flow
field without steady asymptotic. Under the pressure fairly higher than the
limit, the result expresses severe fluctuation of flowrate, oscillation of
corner vortices and also asymmetric irregular wave propagation along the
downstream wall. In addition, flow dynamics seems quite stochastic with almost
no temporal correlation. For the Boger-type fluid, under the traction higher
than steady limit the flowrate and corner vortices exhibit periodic oscillation
with flow asymmetry. Both types of instability express purely elastic
instability in this inertialess flow approximation.

particle injection rate is intrinsically defined by the prescribed scattering
law. We expect to examine the correlation of the energy injection with the

  elsewhere",,,,"math.AG hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Novikov's conjecture on the Riemann-Schottky problem: {\it the Jacobians of
smooth algebraic curves are precisely those indecomposable principally
polarized abelian varieties (ppavs) whose theta-functions provide solutions to
the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation}, was the first evidence of nowadays
well-established fact: connections between the algebraic geometry and the
modern theory of integrable systems is beneficial for both sides.
  The purpose of this paper is twofold. Our first goal is to present a proof of
the strongest known characterization of a Jacobian variety in this direction:
{\it an indecomposable ppav $X$ is the Jacobian of a curve if and only if its
Kummer variety $K(X)$ has a trisecant line} and the solution of the
characterization problem of principally polarized Prym varieties. The latter
problem is almost as old and famous as the Riemann-Schottky problem but is much
harder. In some sense the Prym varieties may be geometrically the
easiest-to-understand ppavs beyond Jacobians, and studying them may be a first
step towards understanding the geometry of more general abelian varieties as
well.
  Our second and primary objective is to take this opportunity to elaborate on
motivations underlining the proposed solution of the Riemann-Schottky problem,
to introduce a certain circle of ideas and methods, developed in the theory of
soliton equations, and to convince the reader that they are algebro-geometric
in nature, simple and universal enough to be included in the Handbook of
moduli.

evolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopic
data from the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Using
data from phase 1 of GAMA, taken over three observing seasons, and correcting
for various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosity
functions (LFs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.
  At low redshift, z < 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to a
magnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over a
range of more than ten magnitudes by simple Schechter functions in all bands.
Red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-law
Schechter functions to fit a dip in their LF faintward of the characteristic
magnitude M* before a steepening faint end. This upturn is at least partly due
to dust-reddened disk galaxies.
  We measure evolution of the galaxy LF over the redshift range 0.002 < z < 0.5
using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned LFs in redshift slices. The
characteristic luminosity L* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,
with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. The
comoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that of
red galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud to
red sequence. As well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxies
also dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. At lower
redshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the riz
bands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

from convection in planetary interiors, where thermal winds are expected due to

convective instability and baroclinic instability. We find a smooth transition
between the two types of modes, and investigate where the transition region
between the two types of instability occurs in parameter space. The thermal
wind helps to destabilise the convective modes. Baroclinic instability can
occur when the applied vertical temperature gradient is stable, and the
critical Rayleigh number is then negative. Long wavelength modes are the first
to become unstable. Asymptotic analysis is possible for the transition region
and also for long wavelength instabilities, and the results agree well with our
numerical solutions. We also investigate how the instabilities in this system
relate to the classical baroclinic instability in the Eady problem. We conclude
by noting that baroclinic instabilities in the Earth's core arising from
heterogeneity in the lower mantle could possibly drive a dynamo even if the
Earth's core were stably stratified and so not convecting.

is required for efficient storage and display purposes and moreover, comes
naturally as a by product of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in imaging. We
propose the use of Delaunay triangulation as opposed to regular gridding of an

the PSWF kernel construction. We show that the computational efficiency
improves without loss of information. Once the PSWF basis is constructed using

different signaling processes. These signaling processes strongly differ in
type with TGFb ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses. Members
of the TGFb family can also act as morphogen and cellular responses would then
be expected to provide a direct read-out of the extracellular ligand
concentration. We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications
that are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGFb signaling
network. To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the
core of the TGFb signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we
identified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give
rise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as
well as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to
time-varying ligand concentrations (as expected in the read-out of morphogens).
A combination of a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus
biases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained response, while
oscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the
turn-over of the I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient
receptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding.
We find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the
response type. The architecture of the TGFb pathway enables the observed
signaling plasticity. The observed range of signaling outputs to TGFb ligand in
different cell types and under different conditions can be explained with
differences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective
rate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways.

superconducting qubit. Using unitary transformations on the multi-level
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian and quantum optics master equation, we derive an
analytical model that goes beyond linear response theory. Within the limits of
validity of the model, we obtain quantitative agreement with experimental and
numerical data, both in the bifurcation and in the parametric amplification
regimes of the nonlinear resonator. We show in particular that the
measurement-induced dephasing rate of the qubit can be rather small at high
drive power. This is in contrast to measurement with a linear resonator where
this rate increases with the drive power. Finally, we show that, for typical
parameters of circuit quantum electrodynamics, correctly describing
measurement-induced dephasing requires a model going beyond linear response
theory, such as the one presented here.

measured U, V and W velocity components that are introduced by distance errors.
We deliver a formalism to describe and interpret the specific imprints of
distance errors including spurious velocity correlations and shifts of mean
motion in a sample. We take into account correlations introduced by measurement
errors, Galactic rotation and changes in the orientation of the velocity
ellipsoid with position in the Galaxy. Tests on pseudodata show that the method
is more robust and sensitive than traditional approaches to this problem. We
investigate approaches to characterising the probability distribution of
distance errors, in addition to the mean distance error, which is the main
theme of the paper. Stars with the most overestimated distances bias our
estimate of the overall distance scale, leading to the corrected distances
being slightly too small. We give a formula that can be used to correct for
this effect. We apply the method to samples of stars from the SEGUE survey,
exploring optimal gravity cuts, sample contamination, and correcting the used
distance relations.

particle creation from the quantum vacuum (and hence it is per se very
interesting), it is also true that it seems difficult to completely explain all
features of the observations by adopting the perspective of a Hawking-like
mechanism for the radiation. For instance, the observed photons are emitted
parallel to the optical horizon, and the relevant optical horizon is itself
defined in an unusual manner by combining group and phase velocities. This
raises the question: Is this really Hawking radiation, or some other form of
quantum vacuum radiation? Naive estimates of the amount of quantum vacuum
radiation generated due to the rapidly changing refractive index --- sometimes
called the dynamical Casimir effect --- are not encouraging. However we feel
that naive estimates could be misleading depending on the quantitative
magnitude of two specific physical effects: ""pulse steepening"" and ""pulse
cresting"". Plausible bounds on the maximum size of these two effects results in
estimates much closer to the experimental observations, and we argue that the
dynamical Casimir effect is now worth additional investigation.

bounded by semipermeable membranes and separated by a thin film of salt-free
liquid. Although the membranes are neutral, the counter-ions of the
polyelectrolyte molecules permeate into the gap and lead to a steric charge
separation. This gives rise to a distance-dependent membrane potential, which
translates into a repulsive electrostatic disjoining pressure. From the
solution of the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation we obtain the
distribution of the potential and of ions. We then derive an explicit formula
for the pressure exerted on the membranes and show that it deviates from the
classical van't Hoff expression for the osmotic pressure. This difference is
interpreted in terms of a repulsive electrostatic disjoining pressure
originating from the overlap of counterion clouds inside the gap. We also
develop a simplified theory based on a linearized Poisson-Boltzmann approach. A
comparison with simulation of a primitive model for the electrolyte is provided
and does confirm the validity of the theoretical predictions Beyond the
fundamental result that the neutral surfaces can repel, this mechanism not only
helps to control the adhesion and long-range interactions of living cells,

i.e., relative number of the PU-idle slots that are used by CR, subject to
interference ratio (IR), i.e., relative number of the PU-active slots that are
used by CR, below a certain level. We introduce an a-posteriori LLR-based
cognitive transmission strategy and show that this strategy is optimum in the
sense of maximizing UR given a certain maximum allowed IR. Two methods for
calculating threshold for this strategy in practical situations are presented.
One of them performs well in higher SNRs but might have too large IR at low
SNRs and low PU activity levels, and the other is proven to never violate the
allowed IR at the price of a reduced UR. In addition, an upper-bound for the UR
of any CR strategy operating in the presence of Markovian PU is presented.
Simulation results have shown a more than 116% improvement in UR at SNR of -3dB

mechanism possesses a high potential in practical scenarios in which there
exists no information about true states of PU.

collapse of regions overdense in small particles requires numerical algorithms
capable of handling simultaneously hydrodynamics, particle dynamics and
particle collisions. While the initial phases of radial contraction are
dictated by drag forces and gravity, particle collisions become gradually more
significant as filaments contract beyond Roche density. Here we present a new
numerical algorithm for treating momentum and energy exchange in collisions
between numerical superparticles representing a high number of physical
particles. We adopt a Monte Carlo approach where superparticle pairs in a grid
cell collide statistically on the physical collision time-scale. Collisions
occur by enlarging particles until they touch and solving for the collision
outcome, accounting for energy dissipation in inelastic collisions. We
demonstrate that superparticle collisions can be consistently implemented at a
modest computational cost. In protoplanetary disc turbulence driven by the
streaming instability, we argue that the relative Keplerian shear velocity
should be subtracted during the collision calculation. If it is not subtracted,
density inhomogeneities are too rapidly diffused away, as bloated particles
exaggerate collision speeds. Local particle densities reach several thousand
times the mid-plane gas density. We find efficient formation of gravitationally
bound clumps, with a range of masses corresponding to contracted radii from 100
to 400 km when applied to the asteroid belt and 150 to 730 km when applied to
the Kuiper belt, extrapolated using a constant self-gravity parameter. The
smaller planetesimals are not observed at low resolution, but the masses of the
largest planetesimals are relatively independent of resolution and treatment of

galactic nuclei (AGNs) that is connected to galaxy mergers. In this context,
detection of AGN pairs should be relatively common. Observationally, however,
dual AGN are scant, being just a few percent of all AGN. In this Letter we
investigate the triggering of AGN activity in merging galaxies via a suite of
high resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We follow the dynamics and
accretion onto the SMBHs as they move from separations of tens of kiloparsecs
to tens of parsecs. Our resolution, cooling and star formation implementation
produce an inhomogeneous, multi-phase interstellar medium, allowing us to
accurately trace star formation and accretion onto the SMBHs. We study the
impact of gas content, morphology, and mass ratio, allowing us to study AGN
activity and dynamics across a wide range of relevant conditions. We test when
the two AGN are simultaneously detectable, for how long and at which
separations. We find that strong dual AGN activity occurs during the late
phases of the mergers, at small separations (<1-10 kpc) below the resolution
limit of most surveys. Much of the SMBH accretion is not simultaneous, limiting
the dual AGN fraction detectable through imaging and spectroscopy to a few
percent, in agreement with observational samples.

  Lattice Field Theory, July 10-16, 2011, Squaw Valley, Lake Tahoe, CA",,,,"hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new and very high statistics study of D and D_s semileptonic
decay form factors on the lattice. We work with MILC N_f=2+1 lattices and use
the Highly Improved Staggered Action (HISQ) for both the charm and the light
valence quarks. We use both scalar and vector currents to determine the form
factors f_0(q^2) and f_+(q^2) for a range of D and D_s form factors including
those for D to pi and D to K semileptonic decays. By using a phased boundary
condition we are able to tune accurately to q^2=0. We also compare the shape in
q^2 to that from experiment. We show that the form factors are very insensitive
to the spectator quark: D to K and D_s to eta_s form factors are essentially
the same, and the same is true for D to pi and D_s to K. This has important
implications when considering the corresponding B/B_s processes.

graphene-based Ferromagnetic/Insulator/d-wave (s-wave) superconductor (F/I/d
and F/I/S) junctions in the ballistic regime. Using the Dirac-BdG wave
functions within the three regions and appropriate boundary conditions, the
Andreev and Normal reflection coefficients are derived. By employing the
obtained Andreev and Normal reflection coefficients the characteristics of heat
current through the F/I/d and F/I/S junctions are investigated within the thin
barrier approximation. We find that for s-wave superconductors, thermal
conductance oscillates sinusoidally vs barrier strength. The finding persist
for the values of $\alpha$, the orientation of d-wave superconductor crystal in
the $k$-space, below $\pi/4$. By increasing temperature, the thermal
conductance is increased exponentially for small values of $\alpha$ and for
larger values the quantity is modified to exhibit a linear behavior at
$\alpha=\pi/4$ which is similar to Wiedemann-Franz law for metals in low
temperatures.

optical lattice site, focussing on the example of RbCs. Collisional control can
be achieved by tuning bound states of the intermolecular dipolar potential, by
varying the applied electric field or trap frequency. We consider a wide range
of electric fields and trapping geometries, showing that a three-dimensional
optical lattice allows for significantly wider avoided crossings than free
space or quasi-two dimensional geometries. Furthermore, we find that dipolar
confinement induced resonances can be created with reasonable trapping
frequencies and electric fields, and have widths that will enable useful
control in forthcoming experiments.

codes, two $s$-extremal $[38,19,6]$ codes, and 1730 $s$-extremal $[38,19,8]$

recent classification of all extremal self-dual codes of length 36, and from a
generalization of this recursive algorithm for the shadow. The classification
of $s$-extremal $[38,19,6]$ codes permits to achieve the classification of all
$s$-extremal codes with d=6.

superluminal speed through matter in the context of the relation between
gravity, spin and torsion. Using a lemma of Penrose and earlier works on the
relation between spin, torsion and gravity I glimpse on a frame work in which
superluminal speed of the neutrinos moving through matter become possible. In
presence of torsoin neutrinos are found to follow spacelike geodesics by
tunneling through the light cone into the spacelike region and consequently
appear to have superluminal speed in our timelike world, whereas photons always
follow null geodesics. This frame work may set new frontiers for spacetime
physics.

  565-606, 2008","10.1613/jair.2490",,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been widely observed that there is no single ""dominant"" SAT solver;
instead, different solvers perform best on different instances. Rather than
following the traditional approach of choosing the best solver for a given
class of instances, we advocate making this decision online on a per-instance
basis. Building on previous work, we describe SATzilla, an automated approach
for constructing per-instance algorithm portfolios for SAT that use so-called
empirical hardness models to choose among their constituent solvers. This
approach takes as input a distribution of problem instances and a set of
component solvers, and constructs a portfolio optimizing a given objective
function (such as mean runtime, percent of instances solved, or score in a
competition). The excellent performance of SATzilla was independently verified
in the 2007 SAT Competition, where our SATzilla07 solvers won three gold, one
silver and one bronze medal. In this article, we go well beyond SATzilla07 by
making the portfolio construction scalable and completely automated, and
improving it by integrating local search solvers as candidate solvers, by
predicting performance score instead of runtime, and by using hierarchical
hardness models that take into account different types of SAT instances. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of these new techniques in extensive experimental
results on data sets including instances from the most recent SAT competition.

order to dominate this problem different kinds of methods has been presented
where the majority of them based on theoretical methods and used unbalanced and

algorithm that divides the desired environment to several areas and in each of
