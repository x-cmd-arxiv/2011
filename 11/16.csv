simultaneously to the unknown index and smoothness of the link function. For
the proposed procedure, we prove a ""local"" oracle inequality (described by the
pointwise seminorm), which is then used to obtain the upper bound on the
maximal risk of the adaptive estimator under assumption that the link function
belongs to a scale of H\""{o}lder classes. The lower bound on the minimax risk
shows that in the case of estimating at a given point the constructed estimator
is optimally rate adaptive over the considered range of classes. For the same
procedure we also establish a ""global"" oracle inequality (under the $ L_r $

This study shows that the proposed method can be applied to estimating
functions of inhomogeneous smoothness, that is whose smoothness may vary from

accretion flow with thermal conduction. The importance of thermal conduction on
hot accretion flow is confirmed by observations of the hot gas that surrounds
Sgr A$^*$ and a few other nearby galactic nuclei. In this research, the effect
of thermal conduction is studied by a saturated form of it, as is appropriate
for weakly collisional systems. The angular momentum transport is assumed to be
a result of viscous turbulence and the $\alpha$-prescription is used for the
kinematic coefficient of viscosity. The equations of accretion flow are solved
in a simplified one-dimensional model that neglects the latitudinal dependence
of the flow. To solve the integrated equations that govern the dynamical
behaviour of the accretion flow, we have used an unsteady self-similar
solution. The solution provides some insights into the dynamics of
quasi-spherical accretion flow and avoids from limits of the steady
self-similar solution. In comparison to accretion flows without thermal
conduction, the disc generally becomes cooler and denser. These properties are
qualitatively consistent with performed simulations in hot accretion flows.
Moreover, the angular velocity increases with the magnitude of conduction,
while the radial infall velocity decreases. The mass accretion rate onto the
central object is reduced in the presence of thermal conduction. We found that
the viscosity and thermal conduction have the opposite effects on the physical
variables. Furthermore, the flow represents a transonic point that moves inward
with the magnitude of conduction or viscosity.

enrichment is still a matter of debate. Aims: Our goal is to probe the
abundance of Li along the RGB, from its base to the tip, to confine Li-rich
phases that are supposed to occur on the RGB. Methods: For this end, we
obtained medium-resolution spectra with the FLAMES spectrograph at the VLT in
GIRAFFE mode for a large sample of 401 low-mass RGB stars located in the
Galactic bulge. The Li abundance was measured in the stars with a detectable Li
670.8 nm line by means of spectral synthesis with COMARCS model atmospheres. A
new 2MASS (J-K) - Teff calibration from COMARCS models is presented in the
Appendix. Results: Thirty-one stars with a detectable Li line were identified,
three of which are Li-rich according to the usual criterion ($\log\epsilon({\rm
Li})>1.5$). The stars are distributed all along the RGB, not concentrated in
any particular phase of the red giant evolution (e.g. the luminosity bump or
the red clump). The three Li-rich stars are clearly brighter than the
luminosity bump and red clump, and do not show any signs of enhanced mass loss.
Conclusions: We conclude that the Li enrichment mechanism cannot be restricted
to a clearly defined phase of the RGB evolution of low-mass stars
($M\sim1M_{\sun}$), contrary to earlier suggestions from disk field stars.

continuity-equation models to allow a distribution P(\lambda|mbh,z) we are able
to draw on constraints from observationally estimated P(\lambda) distributions
and active galaxy fractions while accounting for the luminosity thresholds of
observational samples. We consider models with a Gaussian distribution of log
\lambda, and Gaussians augmented with a power-law tail to low \lambda. Within
our framework, reproducing the high observed AGN fractions at low redshift
requires a characteristic Eddington ratio \lambda_c that declines at late
times, and matching observed Eddington ratio distributions requires P(\lambda)
that broadens at low redshift. To reproduce the observed increase of AGN
fraction with black hole or galaxy mass, we also require a \lambda_c that
decreases with increasing black hole mass, reducing the AGN luminosity
associated with the most massive black holes. Finally, achieving a good match
to the high mass end of the local black hole mass function requires an
increased radiative efficiency at high black hole mass. We discuss the
potential impact of black hole mergers or a \lambda-dependent bolometric
correction, and we compute evolutionary predictions for black hole and galaxy

oscillators, or rotators, with mean-field interaction. Each oscillator has its
own randomly chosen natural frequency (quenched disorder) and it is stirred by
Brownian motion. In the limit N goes to infty this model is accurately
described by a (deterministic) Fokker-Planck equation. We study this equation
and obtain quantitatively sharp results in the limit of weak disorder. We show
that, in general, even when the natural frequencies have zero mean the
oscillators synchronize (for sufficiently strong interaction) around a common
rotating phase, whose frequency is sharply estimated. We also establish the
stability properties of these solutions (in fact, limit cycles). These results
are obtained by identifying the stable hyperbolic manifold of stationary
solutions of an associated non disordered model and by exploiting the
robustness of hyperbolic structures under suitable perturbations. When the
disorder distribution is symmetric the speed vanishes and there is a one
parameter family of stationary solutions : in this case we provide more precise
stability estimates. The methods we use apply beyond the Kuramoto model and we
develop here the case of active rotator models, that is the case in which the
dynamics of each rotator in absence of interaction and noise is not simply a
rotation.

surveys with millions of galaxies, computation time is reduced by a factor 4-12
depending on the desired scales and accuracy. The formulation is also suitable
for pre-calculations and external storage of the spherical harmonics, which
allows for additional speed improvements. The 3DEX code can accommodate data

the inspirals of small compact objects into much more massive black holes.
These sources have the potential to provide a wealth of information about
astronomy and fundamental physics. On short timescales the orbit of the small
object is approximately geodesic. Generic geodesics for a Kerr black hole
spacetime have a complete set of integrals and can be characterized by three
frequencies of the motion. Over the course of an inspiral, a typical system
will pass through resonances where two of these frequencies become
commensurate. The effect of the resonance will be to alter significantly the
rate of inspiral for the duration of the resonance. Understanding the impact of
these resonances on gravitational wave phasing is important to detect and
exploit these signals for astrophysics and fundamental physics. Two
differential equations that might describe the passage of an inspiral through
such a resonance are investigated. These differ depending on whether it is the
phase or the frequency components of a Fourier expansion of the motion that are
taken to be continuous through the resonance. Asymptotic and hyperasymptotic
analysis are used to find the late-time analytic behavior of the solution for a
system that has passed through a resonance. Linearly growing (weak resonances)
or linearly decaying (strong resonances) solutions are found depending on the
strength of the resonance. In the weak-resonance case, frequency resonances
leave an imprint (a resonant memory) on the gravitational frequency evolution.
The transition between weak and strong resonances is characterized by a
square-root singularity, and as one approaches this transition from above, the
solutions to the frequency resonance equation bunch up into families
exponentially fast.

prove a result on the variation of Kawaguchi's canonical height in families of
Henon maps, and derive from this a specialization theorem, showing that the set
of parameters above which a given non-periodic point becomes periodic is a set
of bounded height. Proving this involves showing that the only points of
canonical height zero for a Henon map over a function field are those which are
periodic (in the non-isotrivial case). In the case of quadratic Henon maps f(x,
y)=(y, x+y^2+b), we obtain a stronger result, bounding the canonical height
below by a quantity which grows linearly in the height of b, once the number of

rational periodic points for quadratic Henon maps defined over the rational

metabolic rate scales with brain volume raised to a power of around 5/6. This
value is significantly higher than the more common exponent 3/4 relating whole
body resting metabolism with body mass and several other physiological
variables in animals and plants. This article investigates the reasons for
brain allometric distinction on a level of its microvessels. Based on collected
empirical data it is found that regional cerebral blood flow CBF across gray
matter scales with cortical volume $V$ as $CBF \sim V^{-1/6}$, brain capillary
diameter increases as $V^{1/12}$, and density of capillary length decreases as
$V^{-1/6}$. It is predicted that velocity of capillary blood is almost
invariant ($\sim V^{\epsilon}$), capillary transit time scales as $V^{1/6}$,
capillary length increases as $V^{1/6+\epsilon}$, and capillary number as
$V^{2/3-\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ is typically a small correction for medium
and large brains, due to blood viscosity dependence on capillary radius. It is
shown that the amount of capillary length and blood flow per cortical neuron
are essentially conserved across mammals. These results indicate that geometry
and dynamics of global neuro-vascular coupling have a proportionate character.
Moreover, cerebral metabolic, hemodynamic, and microvascular variables scale
with allometric exponents that are simple multiples of 1/6, rather than 1/4,
which suggests that brain metabolism is more similar to the metabolism of
aerobic than resting body. Relation of these findings to brain functional
imaging studies involving the link between cerebral metabolism and blood flow
is also discussed.

simultaneously fit the observed values of the [OIII]/Hb, [OII]/Hb, and [NII]/Ha

value of the oxygen abundance. The models which fit the observations indicate a
systematic decrease of the electron density with increasing z. They become
dominated by the HOLMES with increasing z only when restricting to solar oxygen
abundance models, which argues that the metallicity above the galactic plane
should be close to solar. They also indicate that N/O increases with increasing
z.

system to perform better than IA at the cost of a higher back-haul capacity

off-line processing. We use these channel estimates to calculate the
performance under ideal conditions. The performance estimates obtained this way
is substantially higher than what is actually observed in the end-to-end
transmissions---in particular in the CoMP case where the theoretical
performance is very high. We find the reason for this discrepancy to be the
impact of dirty-RF effects such as phase-noise and non-linearities. We are able
to model the dirty-RF effects to some extent. These models can be used to
simulate more complex systems and still account for the dirty-RF effects (e.g.,
systems with tens of mobiles and base-stations). Both IA and CoMP perform
better than reference implementations of single-user SIMO and MIMO in our

we can construct complete families of solutions to the inverse problem from any

these processes can be classified by the dual of the group of relators based on
the set of Bragg peaks, and this gives a solution to the homometry problem for
pure point diffraction.
  An ergodic spatial stationary process consists of a measure theoretical
dynamical system and a mapping linking it with the ambient space in which
diffracting density is supposed to exist. After introducing these processes we
study their general properties and link pure point diffraction to almost
periodicity.
  Given a pure point measure we show how to construct from it and a given set
of phases a corresponding ergodic spatial stationary process. In fact we do
this in two separate ways, each of which sheds its own light on the nature of
the problem. The first construction can be seen as an elaboration of the
Halmos--von Neumann theorem, lifted from the domain of dynamical systems to
that of stationary processes. The second is a Gelfand construction obtained by
defining a suitable Banach algebra out of the putative eigenfunctions of the
desired dynamics.

a certain cohomology class. This class vanishes if the family has a global
section. Thus the non-vanishing of the obstruction provides a sufficient (but
not necessary) condition for the model to be contextual.

the obstruction does not vanish, thus yielding cohomological witnesses for

ultraquantum and the quasiclassical decay regimes and explains their

some intermediate lengthscale, e.g. by the beam of vortex rings in the

important for generating the large scale motion associated with the

strongly influenced by their embedding in a noisy protein environment, which
can even serve to enhance the transport efficiency. Interactions with the
environment induce fluctuations of the transition energies of and interactions
between the chlorophyll molecules, and due to the fact that different
fluctuations will partially be caused by the same environmental factors,
correlations between the various fluctuations will occur. We argue that
fluctuations of the interactions should in general not be neglected, as these
have a considerable impact on population transfer rates, decoherence rates and
the efficiency of photosynthetic complexes. Furthermore, while correlations
between transition energy fluctuations have been studied, we provide the first
quantitative study of the effect of correlations between interaction
fluctuations and transition energy fluctuations, and of correlations between
the various interaction fluctuations. It is shown that these additional
correlations typically lead to changes in interchromophore transfer rates,
population oscillations and can lead to a limited enhancement of the light

asteroid (21) Lutetia the 10th July 2010. With its ~100km size, Lutetia is one
of the largest asteroids ever imaged by a spacecraft. During the flyby, the
on-board OSIRIS imaging system acquired spectacular images of Lutetia's
northern hemisphere revealing a complex surface scarred by numerous impact
craters, reaching the maximum dimension of about 55km. In this paper, we assess
the cratering history of the asteroid. For this purpose, we apply current
models describing the formation and evolution of main belt asteroids, that
provide the rate and velocity distributions of impactors. These models, coupled
with appropriate crater scaling laws, allow us to interpret the observed crater
size-frequency distribution (SFD) and constrain the cratering history. Thanks
to this approach, we derive the crater retention age of several regions on
Lutetia, namely the time lapsed since their formation or global surface reset.
We also investigate the influence of various factors -like Lutetia's bulk
structure and crater obliteration- on the observed crater SFDs and the
estimated surface ages. From our analysis, it emerges that Lutetia underwent a
complex collisional evolution, involving major local resurfacing events till
recent times. The difference in crater density between the youngest and oldest
recognized units implies a difference in age of more than a factor of 10. The
youngest unit (Beatica) has an estimated age of tens to hundreds of Myr, while
the oldest one (Achaia) formed during a period when the bombardment of
asteroids was more intense than the current one, presumably around 3.6Gyr ago
or older.

a graceful exit to old inflation. The Universe starts off hot and trapped in a
false vacuum. The Universe supercools and inflates solving the horizon and
flatness problems. The inflaton couples to a set of QCD like fermions. When the
fermions' non-Abelian gauge group freezes, the Yukawa terms generate a tadpole
for the inflaton, which removes the barrier. Inflation ends, and the Universe
rapidly reheats. The thermal effect is technically natural in the same way that
the QCD scale is technically natural. In fact, Witten used a similar mechanism
to drive the Electro-Weak (EW) phase transition; critically, no scalar field
drives inflation, which allows SCI to avoid eternal inflation and the measure
problem. SCI also works at scales, which can be probed in the lab, and could be
connected to EW symmetry breaking. Finally, we introduce a light spectator
field to generate density perturbations, which match the CMB. The light field
does not affect the inflationary dynamics and can potentially generate
non-Gaussianities and isocurvature perturbations observable with Planck.

is still a fundamental unsolved issue. To get insight into the various
processes of galaxy mass assembly, the Mass Assembly Survey with SINFONI in
VVDS (MASSIV) aims at probing the kinematical and chemical properties of a
significant and representative sample of high-redshift (0.9 < z < 1.8)
star-forming galaxies. This paper presents the selection function, the
observing strategy and the global properties of the MASSIV sample. This sample
contains 84 star-forming galaxies, selected from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey
(VVDS) and observed with the SINFONI IFU at the VLT. We present the redshift
distribution, and derive the stellar masses and SED-based star formation rates
(SFR). Integrated metallicities and the presence of type-2 AGNs are
investigated using composite 1D spectra built from VIMOS and SINFONI
observations. The MASSIV selection function, based on star formation criteria
([OII] emission-line strength up to z~1.5 and colors/UV absorption lines at
higher redshifts), provides a good representation of ""normal"" star-forming
galaxies with SED-based SFRs between 5 and 400 Msun/yr in the stellar mass
regime 10^9 - 10^11 Msun. Analysis of typical emission-line ratios performed on
composite spectra reveals that the contamination by type-2 AGNs is very low and
that the integrated metallicity of the galaxies follows the well-known
mass-metallicity relation. The MASSIV sample has been built upon a simple
selection function, fully representative of the star-forming galaxy population
at 0.9 < z < 1.8 for SFR > 5 Msun/yr. Together with the size of the sample, the
spatially-resolved SINFONI data therefore enables us to discuss global, volume
averaged, galaxy kinematic and chemical properties all accross the mass and SFR
range of the survey to derive robust conclusions on galaxy mass assembly over
cosmological timescales.

another possibility, in which the top and bottom GUT scale Yukawa couplings are
equal to a component of the charged lepton Yukawa matrix at the GUT scale in a

states of a qubit and a qutrit is provided as well. Our results establish an
interesting hierarchy, that we conjecture to be universal, between two relevant
and experimentally friendly nonclassicality indicators. This ties in with the
intuition that general quantum correlations should at least contain and in
general exceed entanglement on mixed states of composite quantum systems.

in the mean azimuthal velocity of low [alpha/Fe] thin disc stars with

of Schoenrich & Binney (2009), albeit with a slightly steeper slope. We show
that in a simple picture a Galactic disc without mixing in angular momenta
would display an exceedingly steep trend, while in the case of complete mixing
of all stars the trend has to vanish. The difference between model and
observational data can hence be interpreted as the consequence of the radial
abundance gradient in the model being too high resulting in an underestimate of
the migration strength. We shortly discuss the value of eccentricity

growing taking into account the heterogeneous features of the nodes. The
feature of a node might be a discrete quantity such as a classification of a
URL document as personal page, thematic website, news, blog, search engine,
social network, ect. or the classification of a gene in a functional module.
Moreover the feature of a node can be a continuous variable such as the
position of a node in the embedding space. In order to account for these
properties, in this paper we provide a generalization of growing network models
with preferential attachment that includes the effect of heterogeneous features
of the nodes. The main effect of heterogeneity is the emergence of an
""effective fitness"" for each class of nodes, determining the rate at which
nodes acquire new links. The degree distribution exhibits a multiscaling
behaviour analogous to the the fitness model. This property is robust with
respect to variations in the model, as long as links are assigned through
effective preferential attachment. Beyond the degree distribution, in this
paper we give a full characterization of the other relevant properties of the
model. We evaluate the clustering coefficient and show that it disappears for
large network size, a property shared with the Barab\'asi-Albert model.
Negative degree correlations are also present in the studied class of models,
along with non-trivial mixing patterns among features. We therefore conclude
that both small clustering coefficients and disassortative mixing are outcomes
of the preferential attachment mechanism in general growing networks.

in relation to the underlying geometry and linked to the energetics associated
with the Trapezium stars. These observations enable us to map the spatial
distribution of these fine-structure lines with a spatial resolution between 4""
and 11"" and covering a total square area of about 120""x105"". The spatial
profile of the emission lines are modelled using the radiative transfer code
Cloudy. We find that the spatial distribution of the [CII] line coincides with
that of the [OI] lines. The [NII] line peaks closer to the ionising star than
the other three lines, but with a small region of overlap. We can distinguish
several knots of enhanced emission within the Bar indicating the presence of an
inhomogenous and structured medium. The emission profiles cannot be reproduced
by a single photo-dissociation region, clearly indicating that, besides the
Bar, there is a significant contribution from additional photo-dissociation
region(s) over the area studied. The combination of both the [NII] and [OI]
145um lines can be used to estimate the [CII] emission and distinguish between
its ionised or neutral origin. We have calculated how much [CII] emission comes
from the neutral and ionised region, and find that at least 82% originates from
the photo-dissocciation region. Together, the [CII] 158um and [OI] 63 and 145um

stationary ions subject to a constant background magnetic field is reexamined
in terms of the potential formulation of electrodynamics. Under the same
conditions considered by the standard derivation, the nonlinear self-coupling
between the perturbed electron flow and the potential it generates is
addressed. The plane wave solution for general propagation vector is determined
for all frequencies and expressed in terms of a vector phasor. The behavior of
the solution as described in vacuum units depends upon the ratio of
conductivity to the magnitude of the background field. Only at low conductivity
and below the cyclotron frequency can significant propagation occur as
determined by the ratio of skin depth to wavelength.

much better agreement. Conversely, N(21 cm) can be lower than N(Ly-alpha) by

state can be favorably reproduced in the context of an instability-driven
dynamical evolution model, such as the ""Nice"" model. To date, all successful
realizations of instability models have concentrated on evolving the four giant
planets onto their current orbits from a more compact configuration.
Simultaneously, the possibility of forming and ejecting additional planets has
been discussed, but never successfully implemented. Here we show that a large
array of 5-planet (2 gas giants + 3 ice giants) multi-resonant initial states
can lead to an adequate formation of the outer solar system, featuring an
ejection of an ice giant during a phase of instability. Particularly, our
simulations demonstrate that the eigenmodes which characterize the outer solar
system's secular dynamics can be closely matched with a 5-planet model.
Furthermore, provided that the ejection timescale of the extra planet is short,
orbital excitation of a primordial cold classical Kuiper belt can also be
avoided in this scenario. Thus the solar system is one of many possible
outcomes of dynamical relaxation and can originate from a wide variety of
initial states. This deems the construction of a unique model of solar system's
early dynamical evolution impossible.

  Tasks",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  De-duplication---identification of distinct records referring to the same
real-world entity---is a well-known challenge in data integration. Since very
large datasets prohibit the comparison of every pair of records, {\em blocking}
has been identified as a technique of dividing the dataset for pairwise
comparisons, thereby trading off {\em recall} of identified duplicates for {\em
efficiency}. Traditional de-duplication tasks, while challenging, typically
involved a fixed schema such as Census data or medical records. However, with
the presence of large, diverse sets of structured data on the web and the need
to organize it effectively on content portals, de-duplication systems need to
scale in a new dimension to handle a large number of schemas, tasks and data
sets, while handling ever larger problem sizes. In addition, when working in a
map-reduce framework it is important that canopy formation be implemented as a
{\em hash function}, making the canopy design problem more challenging. We
present CBLOCK, a system that addresses these challenges. CBLOCK learns hash
functions automatically from attribute domains and a labeled dataset consisting
of duplicates. Subsequently, CBLOCK expresses blocking functions using a
hierarchical tree structure composed of atomic hash functions. The application
may guide the automated blocking process based on architectural constraints,
such as by specifying a maximum size of each block (based on memory
requirements), impose disjointness of blocks (in a grid environment), or
specify a particular objective function trading off recall for efficiency. As a
post-processing step to automatically generated blocks, CBLOCK {\em rolls-up}
smaller blocks to increase recall. We present experimental results on two
large-scale de-duplication datasets at Yahoo!---consisting of over 140K movies
and 40K restaurants respectively---and demonstrate the utility of CBLOCK.

of no more than about 1000 stars, on the basis that, in a larger cluster, close
encounters between the Sun and other stars would have truncated the outer Solar
System or excited the outer planets into eccentric orbits. However, this
dynamical limit is in tension with meteoritic evidence that the Solar System
was exposed to a nearby supernova during or shortly after its formation; a
1000-star cluster is much too small for supernova contamination to be likely.
In this paper we revisit the dynamical limit in the light of improved
observations of the properties of young clusters. We use a series of scattering
simulations to measure the velocity-dependent cross-section for disruption of
the outer Solar System by stellar encounters, and use this cross-section to
compute the probability of a disruptive encounter as a function of birth
cluster properties. We find that, contrary to prior work, the probability of
disruption is small regardless of the cluster mass, and that it actually
decreases rather than increases with cluster mass. Our results differ from
prior work for three main reasons: (1) unlike in most previous work, we compute
a velocity-dependent cross section and properly integrate over the cluster
mass-dependent velocity distribution of incoming stars; (2) we adopt
realistically-short cluster lifetimes of a few crossing times, rather than
assuming lifetimes of 10 to 100 Myr; and (3) following recent observations, we
adopt a mass-independent surface density for embedded clusters, rather than a
mass-independent radius as assumed many earlier papers. Our results remove the
tension between the dynamical limit and the meteoritic evidence, and suggest
that the Sun was born in a massive cluster.

matter with spin-polarized surface states that are protected from
backscattering. The static electronic properties of these surface states have
been comprehensively imaged by both photoemission and tunneling spectroscopies.
Theorists have proposed that topological surface states can also exhibit novel
electronic responses to light, such as topological quantum phase transitions
and spin-polarized electrical currents. However, the effects of optically
driving a topological insulator out of equilibrium have remained largely
unexplored experimentally, and no photocurrents have been measured. Here we
show that illuminating the topological insulator Bi2Se3 with circularly
polarized light generates a photocurrent that originates from topological
helical Dirac fermions, and that reversing the helicity of the light reverses
the direction of the photocurrent. We also observe a photocurrent that is
controlled by the linear polarization of light, and argue that it may also have
a topological surface state origin. This approach may allow the probing of
dynamic properties of topological insulators and lead to novel opto-spintronic
devices.

oxygen abundance in the interstellar medium, we measure the metallicity of the

these galaxies, leading to a spatially-resolved estimate of the oxygen
abundance in each galaxy. We derive a metallicity gradient for 26 galaxies in
our sample and discover a significant fraction of galaxies with a ""positive""
gradient. Using a simple chemical evolution model, we derive infall rates of
pristine gas onto the disks. Seven galaxies display a positive gradient at a
high confidence level. Four out of these are interacting and one is a chain
galaxy. We suggest that interactions might be responsible for shallowing and
even inverting the abundance gradient. We also identify two interesting
correlations in our sample: a) galaxies with higher gas velocity dispersion
have shallower/positive gradients; and b) metal-poor galaxies tend to show a
positive gradient whereas metal-rich ones tend to show a negative one. This
last observation can be explained by the infall of metal-poor gas into the
center of the disks. We address the question of the origin of this infall under
the influence of gas flows triggered by interactions and/or cold gas accretion.

spin Hall conductivities from 2.4 x 10^4 to 5.1 x 10^5 [hbar/(2e)] (Ohm-m)^-1
and spin Hall angles from 0.0037 to 0.08. We review this work, and analyze
possible reasons for the discrepancies. We explain that the smallest values for
the spin Hall angle that have been reported, based on measurements of lateral
permalloy/copper/platinum devices, are incorrect because the original analyses
did not properly take into account that copper layers in these devices will
shunt charge current flowing through adjacent platinum wires, thereby greatly
reducing the size of the spin-Hall-related signals. We suggest that differences
between the results for the spin Hall angle found by other experimental
techniques are primarily a consequence of different assumptions about the value
of the spin diffusion length in Pt. We present a new measurement of the spin
diffusion length in Pt within sputtered Pt/permalloy bilayer thin films at room
temperature, finding 1.4 \pm 0.3 nm, a much smaller value than has generally
been assumed previously. With this value for the spin diffusion length, the
previously-discordant results can be brought into much better agreement, with
the result that the spin Hall conductivities are (1.4 - 3.4) x 10^5 [hbar/(2e)]
(Ohm-m)^-1 and the spin Hall angles are greater than 0.05. These values are
sufficiently large that the spin Hall effect in Pt can be used to generate spin
currents and spin transfer torques strong enough for efficient manipulation of
magnetic moments in adjacent ferromagnetic layers.

scenarios. In the class of theories whose actions are generated by Lagrangians
of the form $f(R)=\sum \alpha_{n}\,R^{n}$ we find parameters which allow for
the existence of energy condition respecting throats, which do not exist in
Einstein gravity. We also consider the effect of the modified action on the
anisotropy of the models, and find that modified gravity can minimize the
amount of anisotropy required to support the existence of a throat. In both
these respects, the sector containing theories with positive $n$ is more
promising than the negative $n$ sector in comparison to Einstein gravity alone,
with large $n$ being most favorable

biophysical phenomena such as the folding of globular proteins, the opening and
closing of ligand-gated ion channels, and ligand binding to hydrophobic
pockets. We use forward flux sampling, a molecular simulation technique, to
compute the rate of capillary evaporation of water confined between two
hydrophobic surfaces separated by nanoscopic gaps, as a function of gap,
surface size and temperature. Over the range of conditions investigated (gaps
between 9 and 14 {\AA} and surface areas between 1 and 9 nm^2) the free energy
barrier to evaporation scales linearly with the gap between hydrophobic
surfaces, suggesting that line tension makes the predominant contribution to
the free energy barrier. The exponential dependence of the evaporation rate on
the gap between confining surfaces causes a ten order-of-magnitude decrease in
the rate when the gap increases from 9 to 14 {\AA}. The computed free energy
barriers are of the order of 50kT, and are predominantly enthalpic. Evaporation
rates per unit area are found to be two orders of magnitude faster in
confinement by the larger (9 nm^2) than by the smaller (1nm^2) surfaces
considered here, at otherwise identical conditions. We show that this is a
direct consequence of the dependence of hydrophobic hydration on the size of
solvated objects. For sufficiently large surfaces, the critical nucleus for the
evaporation process is a gap-spanning cylindrical vapor tube.

$\sim$1.3 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$. Six of the ten sources are identified as CSOs with

their conversion to $e^+e^-$ in an active target embedded in a magnetic field.
The background to the single photon signal is dominated by the asymmetric decay
of neutral pions produced either in a coherent neutrino-nucleus interaction, or
in a neutrino-nucleon neutral current deep inelastic scattering, or in an
interaction occurring outside the fiducial volume. All three backgrounds are
determined {\it in situ} using control data samples prior to opening the

study resource allocation amongst a collection of users/entities across
disciplines as diverse as economics, law and engineering. In network
engineering, this framework has been particularly insightful towards
understanding how Internet protocols allocate bandwidth, and motivated diverse
research on distributed mechanisms to maximize network utility while
incorporating new relevant constraints, on energy/power, storage, stability,
etc., for systems ranging from communication networks to the smart-grid.
However when the available resources and/or users' utilities vary over time, a
user's allocations will tend to vary, which in turn may have a detrimental
impact on the users' utility or quality of experience. This paper introduces a
generalized NUM framework which explicitly incorporates the detrimental impact
of temporal variability in a user's allocated rewards. It explicitly
incorporates tradeoffs amongst the mean and variability in users' allocations.
We propose an online algorithm to realize variance-sensitive NUM, which, under
stationary ergodic assumptions, is shown to be asymptotically optimal, i.e.,
achieves a time-average equal to that of an offline algorithm with knowledge of
the future variability in the system. This substantially extends work on NUM to
an interesting class of relevant problems where users/entities are sensitive to
temporal variability in their service or allocated rewards.

constant when coupling the x and y variables of the Chua model but not when
coupling the z variable. This range of coupling constant decreases with
increasing levels of noise in the observations. The Chua system does not show
synchrony when the time gap between observations is greater than about
one-seventh of the Lyapunov time. Finally, we also note that prediction errors
are much larger when noisy observations are used than when using observations

information about its dynamical properties. We investigate the synchronization
transition, an archetypical example of a dynamic phase transition, in the
framework of such a temporal response. The Kuramoto model under periodically
switching interactions has the same type of phase transition as the original
mean-field model. Furthermore, we see that the signature of the synchronization
transition appears in the relative delay of the order parameter with respect to
the phase of oscillating interactions as well. Specifically, the phase shift
becomes significantly larger as the system gets closer to the phase transition
so that the order parameter at the minimum interaction density can even be
larger than that at the maximum interaction density, counterintuitively. We
argue that this phase-shift inversion is caused by the diverging relaxation
time, in a similar way to the resonance near the critical point in the kinetic
Ising model. Our result, based on exhaustive simulations on globally coupled
systems as well as scale-free networks, shows that an oscillator system's phase
transition can be manifested in the temporal response to the topological

will still maintain detectable eccentricities, spanning a broad range from

distributions, with the latter favoring larger eccentricities. At larger binary

the case of hot ionized discs of nova like cataclysmic variables. Our model
successfully fits the observed power density spectrum of KR Aur with the disc
parameter alpha = 0.10 - 0.40 and an inner disc truncation radius in the range
R_in = 0.88 - 1.67 x 10^9 cm. The exact values depend on the mass transfer rate
in the sense that alpha decreases and R_in increases with mass transfer rate.
In any case, the inner disc radius found for KR Aur is considerably smaller
than in quiescent dwarf novae, as predicted by the disc instability model. On
the other hand, our simulations fail to reproduce the power density spectrum of
UU Aqr. A tantalizing explanation involves the possible presence of spiral
waves, which are expected in UU Aqr, because of its low mass ratio, but not in
KR Aur. In general our model predicts the observed concentration of flickering
in the central disc. We explain this by the radial dependence of the angular

two-dimensional XY-type anisotropy shows a metamagnetic behavior at the

critical behavior is observed around H_M. Although the magnetic character is
entirely different from that in other Ce-based HF metamagnets, H_M in these
metamagnets is linearly proportional to the inverse of the effective mass, or
to the temperature where the susceptibility shows a peak. This finding suggests
that H_M is a magnetic field breaking the local Kondo singlet, and the critical
behavior around H_M is driven by the Kondo breakdown accompanied by the
Fermi-surface instability.

practical limitations of reachability better than the usual percolation model,

therefore, communication. We find that this model leads to a first order phase
transition in both 2-dimensional lattices and in Erdos-Renyi networks, and in
the case of the latter, the size of the discontinuity implies that the
transition is effectively catastrophic, with almost all system pairs undergoing
the change from reachable to unreachable. Using the theory of optimal path
lengths under disorder, we are able to predict the percolation threshold. For
real networks subject to changes while in operation, this model should perform
better in predicting functional limits than current percolation models.

However, building large arrays in practice, would require the use of

characteristics and hence would require the use of input signals with a very
small peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we consider the
single-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) downlink channel for the case
where the BS antennas are constrained to transmit signals having constant
envelope (CE). We show that, with per-antenna CE transmission the effective
channel seen by the receiver is a SISO AWGN channel with its input constrained
to lie in a doughnut-shaped region. For single-path direct-line-of-sight (DLOS)
and general i.i.d. fading channels, analysis of the effective doughnut channel
shows that under a per-antenna CE input constraint, i) compared to an
average-only total transmit power constrained MISO channel, the extra total
transmit power required to achieve a desired information rate is small and
bounded, ii) with N base station antennas an O(N) array power gain is
achievable, and iii) for a desired information rate, using power-efficient

Riemannian structure induced by the embedding of the family into the Hilbert

as a consequence of the positivity of interest rates. Therefore, by mapping the
density functions associated with a given family of term structures to Hilbert

of yield curves to one another. We show that the general arbitrage-free yield

type galaxies, pointed out by many authors, is interpreted in the context of
Clausius' virial maximum theory. In this view, it is strongly underlined that
the key of the above mentioned correlation is owing to the presence of a deep
link between cosmology and the existence of the galaxy Fundamental Plane. Then
the ultimate meaning is: understanding visible mass - size correlation and/or
Fundamental Plane means understanding how galaxies form. The mass - size
relationship involves baryon (mainly stellar) mass and its typical dimension
related to the light, but it gets memory of the cosmological mass variance at
the equivalence epoch. The reason is that the baryonic component virializes by
sharing virial energy in about equal amount between baryons and dark matter,
this sharing depending, in turn, on the steepness of the dark matter
distribution. The general strategy consists in using the two-component tensor
virial theorem for determining the virialized baryonic configurations. A King
and a Zhao density profile are assumed for the inner baryonic and the outer
dark matter component, respectively, at the end of the relaxation phase. All
the considerations are restricted to spherical symmetry for simplicity. The
effect of changing the dark-to-baryon mass ratio, m, is investigated inside a
LambdaCDM scenario. A theoretical mass - size relation is expressed for the
baryonic component, which fits fairly well to the data from a recently studied
galaxy sample. Finally, the play of intrinsic dispersion on the mass ratio, m,
is discussed in the light of the cusp/core problem and some consequences are

recent numerical experiments, the sparse regularization does not necessarily
show a good performance compared with dense type regularizations. Motivated by
this fact, this paper gives a general theoretical tool to derive fast learning
rates of MKL that is applicable to arbitrary mixed-norm-type regularizations in
a unifying manner. This enables us to compare the generalization performances
of various types of regularizations. As a consequence, we observe that the
homogeneity of the complexities of candidate reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs) affects which regularization strategy (\ell1 or dense) is preferred. In
fact, in homogeneous complexity settings where the complexities of all RKHSs
are evenly same, \ell1-regularization is optimal among all isotropic norms. On
the other hand, in inhomogeneous complexity settings, dense type
regularizations can show better learning rate than sparse \ell1-regularization.

  This is accomplished by using a data model that primarily stores how catalogs
are derived; the contents of the catalogs are only created when necessary and
stored only when beneficial for performance. Discovery of existing catalogs and
creation of new catalogs is done through the same process by directly
requesting the final set of sources (astronomical objects) and attributes
(physical properties) that is required, for example from within visualization
software.
  New catalogs are automatically created to provide attributes of sources for
which no suitable existing catalogs can be found. These catalogs are defined to
contain the new attributes on the largest set of sources the calculation of the
attributes is applicable to, facilitating reuse for future data requests.
Subsequently, only those parts of the catalogs that are required for the
requested end product are actually processed, ensuring scalability.
  The presented mechanisms primarily determine which catalogs are created and
what data has to be processed and stored: the actual processing and storage
itself is left to existing functionality of the underlying information system.

find that droplets of a wide range of sizes have the same characteristic lens
shape, and explain this result in terms of simple capillarity arguments,
consistent with the measured variations of surface concentrations of amphiphile

effect of the strength chi_BO of the repulsion between the hydrophobic liquid
and the amphiphile tails on the droplet shape, and find a gradual flattening of
the droplet as chi_BO is reduced. The droplet remains at least metastable even
at very low values of chi_BO. This is in contrast to the behavior as the length
of the hydrophobic molecules is varied. Specifically, if these molecules are at
least as long as the amphiphile tails, increasing their length further is found
to have little effect on the droplet shape, while reducing their length below
this value quickly causes the droplet to become unstable.

orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck models of globular star clusters in a galactic
tidal field. The existence of a large number of potential escapers, which have
energies above the escape energy but are still within the tidal radius, is
taken into account in the models. The models allow potential escapers to
experience gravitational scatterings before they leave clusters and thus some
of them may lose enough energy to be bound again. It is shown that the mass
evolution of the Fokker-Planck models are in good agreement with that of N-body
models including the full tidal-force field. The mass-loss time does not simply
scale with the relaxation time due to the existence of potential escapers; it
increases with the number of stars more slowly than the relaxation time, though
it tends to be proportional to the relaxation time in the limit of a weak tidal
field. The Fokker-Planck models include two parameters, the coefficient gamma
in the Coulomb logarithm ln(gamma N) and the coefficient nu_e controlling the
efficiency of the mass loss. The values of these parameters are determined by
comparing the Fokker-Planck models with the N-body models. It is found that the
parameter set (gamma, nu_e)=(0.11, 7) works well for both single-mass and
multi-mass clusters, but that the parameter set (gamma, nu_e)=(0.02, 40) is
another possible choice for multi-mass clusters.

rolling motion dominates as the droplet shape approaches a circle, and the
viscosity contrast between the droplet and the ambient fluid becomes large. As
a consequence of kinematics, the amount of rotation in a general droplet shape
follows a universal curve characterised by geometry, and independent of Bond
number, surface inclination and equilibrium contact angle, but determined by
the slip length and viscosity contrast. Our results open the way towards a
rational design of droplet-surface properties, both when rolling motion is

we determine the contribution of bulge light at r > r_brk for a large sample of
78 (barred/unbarred, Sa-Sd) spiral galaxies with outer disc antitruncations
(mu_brk > 24 mag arcsec^-2). In the majority of cases (~85 per cent), evidence
indicates that excess light at r > r_brk is related to an outer shallow disc
(Type III-d). Here, the contribution of bulge light at r > r_brk is either
negligible (~70 per cent) or too little to explain the antitruncation (~15 per
cent). However in the latter cases, bulge light can affect the measured disc
properties (e.g. mu_brk, outer scalelength). In the remaining cases (~15 per
cent), light at r > r_brk is dominated by the bulge (Type III-s). Here, for
most cases the bulge profile dominates at all radii and only occasionally (3
galaxies, ~5 per cent) extends beyond that of a dominant disc and explains the
excess light at r > r_brk. We thus conclude that in the vast majority of cases
antitruncated outer discs cannot be explained by bulge light and thus remain a
pure disc phenomenon.

distinct morphologies, corresponding to two boundary layers (inner and outer),
and the bulk of the interior. Previous work has shown that the thermal wind
equation together with informal arguments on the nature of convection in a
rotating fluid could be used to deduce the shape of the isorotation surfaces in
the bulk of the SCZ with great fidelity, and that the tachocline contours could
also be described by relatively simple phenomenology. In this paper, we show
that the form of these surfaces can be understood more broadly as a
mathematical consequence of the thermal wind equation and a narrow convective
shell. The analysis does not yield the angular velocity function directly, an
additional surface boundary condition is required. But much can already be
deduced without constructing the entire rotation profile. The mathematics may
be combined with dynamical arguments put forth in previous works to the mutual
benefit of each. An important element of our approach is to regard the constant
angular velocity surfaces as an independent coordinate variable for what is
termed the ""residual entropy,"" a quantity that plays a key role in the equation
of thermal wind balance. The difference between the dynamics of the bulk of the
SCZ and the tachocline is due to a different functional form of the residual
entropy in each region. We develop a unified theory for the rotational behavior
of both the SCZ and the tachocline, using the solutions for the characteristics
of the thermal wind equation. These characteristics are identical to the
isorotation contours in the bulk of the SCZ, but the two deviate in the
tachocline. The outer layer may be treated, at least descriptively, by similar
mathematical techniques, but this region probably does not obey thermal wind
balance.

derive rigorously the asymptotic model guessed by the physicists, and show that
this asymptotic analysis contains the in- formation about the presence of

part but from the linear Hamiltonian. More precisely, the analysis of the
nonlinear minimization problem and its asymptotic reduction to simpler ones,
relies on an accurate partition of low and high frequencies (or mo- menta).
This requires to reconsider carefully previous mathematical works about the
adiabatic limit. Although the estimates are not sharp, this asymptotic analysis

the specific case of the Seyfert galaxy NGC3227, for which there are
subarcsecond resolution data for the HCN (1-0) 88 GHz and CO (2-1) 230 GHz
rotational lines, enabling us to spatially separate a circumnuclear ring at a
radius of 140pc and an inner nuclear region within 40pc of the AGN. The
HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1) flux ratio differs by more than an order of magnitude between
these two regions. We carry out large velocity gradient (LVG) computations to
determine the range of parameters (gas temperature and density, HCN/CO
abundance ratio, column densities and velocity gradients) that yield physically
plausible solutions for the observed flux ratio in the central 100pc. The
observed HCN/CO intensity ratio in the nucleus is consistent with very
optically thick thermalized emission in very dense (>=10^5cm^{-3}) gas, in
which case the HCN/CO abundance ratio there is unconstrained. Alternatively,
the HCN/CO intensity ratio could be due to optically thinner emissions but with
very high (~10^{-2}) HCN/CO abundance ratios. This possibility is more
consistent with the CO and HCN emissions seen in the nuclei of the Seyfert
galaxies NGC1068 and NGC6951. It would imply the velocity gradients are large
and the clouds may be gravitationally unbound. We estimate that the X-ray
ionisation rate at radii less than 20pc in the centre of NGC3227 exceeds
10^{-13}s^{-1}. X-ray ionisation and heating may lead to high HCN/CO ratios in
warm gas in a high-ionisation molecular phase near the AGN.

primordial binaries which are the progenitors of HMXBs, and follow the
transformation of these ditributions with the aid of a Jacobian formalism as
the former evolve into the latter through the processes of the first mass
transfer and the supernova (SN) that follows. We discuss the distributions of
the post-SN binaries and the HMXBs. We show that our calculated model XLF has a
differential slope $\approx -1.6$ with a flattening at low luminosities, in
excellent agreement with observations. The calculated binary-period
distribution, which basically has a slightly sloping plateau-like character at
intermediate periods, with a rise to this plateau at shorter periods and
fall-off from it at longer periods, is in agreement with the observed
distribution within observational uncertainties. We discuss the physical origin
of these distributions. We demonstrate that, while the effects of both (a) the
distribution of the properties of the massive companion in the HMXBs, and (b)
the primordial orbital distribution and the SN dynamics are important, the
former appear to be dominant in determining the XLF, and the latter in
determining the HMXB binary-period distribution. We discuss the possible roles
of stellar-mass black holes and ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX) in the

the Viterbi decoder, is derived and solved. The general solution of this matrix
equation yields a closed form expression for the exact bit error probability.
As special cases, the expressions obtained by Best et al. for the 2-state

encoders, including rate R=1/2 and R=2/3 encoders, of as many as 16 states.
  Moreover, it is shown that it is straightforward to extend the approach to

observed at the Dirac point of graphene sheets and topological insulator

p_i=(x_i,y_i) and x_1<x_2<...<x_N. A famous 1935 Erdos--Szekeres theorem
asserts that every such P contains a monotone subsequence S of $\sqrt N$
points. Another, equally famous theorem from the same paper implies that every
such P contains a convex or concave subsequence of $\Omega(\log N)$ points.
  Monotonicity is a property determined by pairs of points, and convexity
concerns triples of points. We propose a generalization making both of these
theorems members of an infinite family of Ramsey-type results. First we define
a (k+1)-tuple $K\subseteq P$ to be positive if it lies on the graph of a
function whose kth derivative is everywhere nonnegative, and similarly for a
negative (k+1)-tuple. Then we say that $S\subseteq P$ is kth-order monotone if
its (k+1)-tuples are all positive or all negative.
  We investigate quantitative bound for the corresponding Ramsey-type result
(i.e., how large kth-order monotone subsequence can be guaranteed in every
N-point P). We obtain an $\Omega(\log^{(k-1)}N)$ lower bound ((k-1)-times
iterated logarithm). This is based on a quantitative Ramsey-type theorem for
what we call transitive colorings of the complete (k+1)-uniform hypergraph; it
also provides a unified view of the two classical Erdos--Szekeres results
mentioned above.
  For k=3, we construct a geometric example providing an $O(\log\log N)$ upper
bound, tight up to a multiplicative constant. As a consequence, we obtain
similar upper bounds for a Ramsey-type theorem for order-type homogeneous
subsets in R^3, as well as for a Ramsey-type theorem for hyperplanes in R^4

gauge theories the frame vectors (or vielbeins) in internal symmetry space, in
addition to the standard gauge boson and matter fermion fields, one obtains:
(i) for the $su(2) \times u(1)$ symmetry, the standard electroweak theory with
the Higgs field thrown in as part of the framed gauge theoretical structure,
(ii) for the $su(3) \times su(2) \times u(1)$ symmetry, a ""framed standard
model"" with, apart from the Higgs field as before, a global $su(3)$ symmetry to
play the role of fermion generations, plus some other properties which are
shown elsewhere to give to both quarks and leptons hierarchical mass and mixing
patterns similar to those experimentally observed. Besides, the ""framing"" of
the standard model as such has brought the particle theory closer in structure
to the theory of gravity where vierbeins have long figured as dynamical
variables. Although most of the results have already been reported before, time
and hindsight have allowed their presentation in this review to be made more
transparent and succint.

the thermodynamic limit - when the number of particles becomes very large.
Here, we study thermodynamics in the opposite regime - at both the nano scale,
and when quantum effects become important. Applying results from quantum
information theory we construct a theory of thermodynamics in these limits. We
derive general criteria for thermodynamical state transformations, and as
special cases, find two free energies: one that quantifies the
deterministically extractable work from a small system in contact with a heat
bath, and the other that quantifies the reverse process. We find that there are
fundamental limitations on work extraction from nonequilibrium states, owing to
finite size effects and quantum coherences. This implies that thermodynamical
transitions are generically irreversible at this scale. As one application of
these methods, we analyse the efficiency of small heat engines and find that
they are irreversible during the adiabatic stages of the cycle.

Further, we give the explicit characterization of the quantum states saturating

which is a modification of the restricted three body problem pertaining to
motion of a satellite around a planet. Although the dynamics of the circular
Hill model have been extensively studied in the literature, only few results
about the dynamics of the elliptic model were known up to now, namely the
equations of motion and few unstable families of periodic orbits. In the
present study we extend these results by computing a large set of families of
periodic orbits and their linear stability and classify them according to their
resonance condition. Although most of them are unstable, we were able to find a
considerable number of stable ones. By computing appropriate maps of dynamical
stability, we study the effect of the planetary eccentricity on the stability
of satellite orbits. We see that, even for large values of the planetary
eccentricity, regular orbits can be found in the vicinity of stable periodic
orbits. The majority of irregular orbits are escape orbits.
