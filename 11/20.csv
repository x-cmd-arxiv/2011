they are sufficient to give scheme-theoretic defining equations. An algorithm
to decompose a general ternary quintic as the sum of seven fifth powers is

located on the boundary of a smooth domain $\Omega\subset \rr^N$, $N\geq 1$.
The problem we address is very much related to optimal Hardy-Poincar\'{e}

recent past in various papers. In view of that, the proper functional framework
is described and explained.
  Secondly, we apply the Pohozaev identity not only to study semi-linear
elliptic equations but also to derive the method of multipliers in order to
study the exact boundary controllability of the wave and Schr\""{o}dinger

complements and extends well known results by Vanconstenoble and Zuazua [34],

suggested that any two persons are distanced by at most six friendship links.
(The exact wording of the story is slightly ambiguous: ""He bet us that, using
no more than five individuals, one of whom is a personal acquaintance, he could
contact the selected individual [...]"". It is not completely clear whether the
selected individual is part of the five, so this could actually allude to
distance five or six in the language of graph theory, but the ""six degrees of
separation"" phrase stuck after John Guare's 1990 eponymous play. Following
Milgram's definition and Guare's interpretation, we will assume that ""degrees
of separation"" is the same as ""distance minus one"", where ""distance"" is the
usual path length-the number of arcs in the path.) Stanley Milgram in his
famous experiment challenged people to route postcards to a fixed recipient by
passing them only through direct acquaintances. The average number of
intermediaries on the path of the postcards lay between 4.4 and 5.7, depending
on the sample of people chosen.
  We report the results of the first world-scale social-network graph-distance
computations, using the entire Facebook network of active users (\approx721
million users, \approx69 billion friendship links). The average distance we
observe is 4.74, corresponding to 3.74 intermediaries or ""degrees of
separation"", showing that the world is even smaller than we expected, and
prompting the title of this paper. More generally, we study the distance
distribution of Facebook and of some interesting geographic subgraphs, looking
also at their evolution over time.
  The networks we are able to explore are almost two orders of magnitude larger

epidemiological, antigenic, genealogical and geographic patterns observed in
influenza virus. We find that evolution away from existing human immunity
results in rapid population turnover in the influenza virus and that this
population turnover occurs primarily along a single antigenic axis. Thus,
selective dynamics induce a canalized evolutionary trajectory, in which the
evolutionary fate of the influenza population is surprisingly repeatable and

similar information-constraints is restricted to static parameter estimation,
whereas, the work on dynamical systems assumes large number of information
exchange iterations between every two consecutive system evolution steps.
  We show that when the agent communication network is sparely-connected, the
sparsity of the network plays a key role in the stability and performance of
the underlying estimation algorithm. To this end, we introduce the notion of
\emph{Network Tracing Capacity} (NTC), which is defined as the largest two-norm
of the system matrix that can be estimated with bounded error. Extending this
to fully-connected networks or infinite information exchanges (per dynamical
system evolution-step), we note that the NTC is infinite, i.e., any dynamical
system can be estimated with bounded error. In short, the NTC characterizes the
estimation capability of a sparse network by relating it to the evolution of

tensor calculus. But it is claimed that spinors as such cannot be represented
in coordinates in a curved space-time. What general covariance means for
theories with fermions is thus unclear. In fact both commonplaces are wrong.
Though it is not widely known, Ogievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed
spinors in coordinates in 1965, helping to spawn nonlinear group
representations. Locally, these spinors resemble the orthonormal basis or
""tetrad"" formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually
self-sufficient. The tetrad formalism is de-Ockhamized, with 6 extra fields and
6 compensating gauge symmetries. OP spinors, as developed nonperturbatively by
Bilyalov, admit any coordinates at a point, but ""time"" must be listed first:
the product of the metric components and the matrix diag(-1,1,1,1) must have no
negative eigenvalues to yield a real symmetric square root function of the
metric. Thus the admissible coordinates depend on the types and values of the
fields. Apart from coordinate order and spinorial two-valuedness, OP spinors
form, with the metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and covariant
derivatives. Such spinors avoid a spurious absolute object in the
Anderson-Friedman analysis of substantive general covariance. They also permit
the gauge-invariant localization of the infinite-component gravitational energy
in GR. Density-weighted spinors exploit the conformal invariance of the
massless Dirac equation to show that the volume element is absent. Thus instead
of a matrix with 16 components, one can use weighted OP spinors coupled to the
9-component symmetric unimodular square root of the conformal metric density.
The surprising mildness of the restrictions on coordinates for the
Schwarzschild solution is exhibited. (edited)

henceforth referred to as sos-convexity, can be checked by semidefinite

Although for disparate reasons, the remarkable outcome is that convex

of galaxies and cosmology. Large mm-wave telescopes are now routinely detecting
and mapping the SZ effect in a number of clusters, measure their comptonisation
parameter and use them as probes of the large-scale structure and evolution of
the universe. We show that estimates of the physical parameters of clusters
(optical depth, plasma temperature, peculiar velocity, non-thermal components
etc.) obtained from ground-based multi-band SZ photometry can be significantly
biased, owing to the reduced frequency coverage, to the degeneracy between the
parameters and to the presence of a number of independent components larger
than the number of frequencies measured. We demonstrate that low-resolution
spectroscopic measurements of the SZ effect that also cover frequencies $> 270$
GHz are effective in removing the degeneracy. We used accurate simulations of
observations with lines-of-sight through clusters of galaxies with different
experimental configurations (4-band photometers, 6-band photometer, multi-range
differential spectrometer, full coverage spectrometers) and different
intracluster plasma stratifications. We find that measurements carried out with
ground-based few-band photometers are biased towards high electron temperatures
and low optical depths, and require coverage of high frequency and/or
independent complementary observations to produce unbiased information; a
differential spectrometer that covers 4 bands with a resolution of $\sim 6 \
GHz$ eliminates most if not all bias; full-range differential spectrometers are
the ultimate resource that allows a full recovery of all parameters.

precode, align, and reduce the dimension of interference at the receivers, to
achieve the channel's maximum multiplexing gain, through what is known as
interference alignment. Most interference alignment algorithms require
knowledge of all the interfering channels to compute the alignment precoders.
CSI, considered available at the receivers, can be shared with the transmitters
via limited feedback. When alignment is done by coding over frequency
extensions in a single antenna system, the required CSI lies on the
Grassmannian manifold and its structure can be exploited in feedback.
Unfortunately, the number of channels to be shared grows with the square of the
number of users, creating too much overhead with conventional feedback methods.
This paper proposes Grassmannian differential feedback to reduce feedback
overhead by exploiting both the channel's temporal correlation and Grassmannian
structure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is characterized both
analytically and numerically as a function of channel length, mobility, and the
number of feedback bits. The main conclusions are that the proposed feedback
strategy allows interference alignment to perform well over a wide range of
Doppler spreads, and to approach perfect CSI performance in slowly varying
channels. Numerical results highlight the trade-off between the frequency of
feedback and the accuracy of individual feedback updates.

differentiation is a core problem in biology. We develop a quantitative model
that shows that a multicellular form emerges from genetically identical

advantage. This division of labour between the cells in the aggregate occurs
spontaneously at the regulatory level due to mechanisms present in unicellular
ancestors and does not require any genetic pre-disposition for a particular
role in the aggregate or any orchestrated cooperative behaviour of aggregate
cells. Mathematically, aggregation implies an increase in the dimensionality of
phenotype space that generates a fitness landscape with new fitness maxima, and
in which the unicellular states of optimized metabolism become fitness saddle
points. Evolution of multicellularity is modeled as evolution of a hereditary
parameter, the propensity of cells to stick together, which determines the
fraction of time a cell spends in the aggregate form. Stickiness can increase
evolutionarily due to the fitness advantage generated by the division of labour
between cells in an aggregate.

dense gas than HNC and C2H. We found evidence for increase in optical depth of
C2H with `radius' from center to outer regions in some targets, supporting the
chemical model of C2H. The C2H optical depth is found to decline as molecular
clouds evolve to later stage, suggesting that C2H might be used as ""chemical

investigated with three molecular lines. All these sources show significant
velocity gradients. The magnitudes of gradient are found to increase towards
the inner region, indicating differential rotation of clouds. Both the ratio of
rotational to gravitational energy and specific angular momentum seem to
decrease toward the inner region, implying obvious angular momentum transfer,

balance between hydrostatic pressure and viscous stresses on the roller
surface. In addition, we consider the azimuthal force balance, primarily
between pressure and viscosity, but also including non-hydrostatic pressure
contributions from surface tension in light of recent observations by Bush et
al. The model can be analyzed by linearization around the circular state,
resulting in a parameter relationship for nearly circular polygonal states. A
truncated, but fully nonlinear version of the model can be solved analytically.
This simpler model gives rise to polygonal shapes that are very similar to
those observed in experiments, even though surface tension is neglected, and
the condition for the existence of a polygon with N corners depends only on a
single dimensionless number {\phi}. Finally, we include time-dependent terms in
the model and study linear stability of the circular state. Instability occurs
for suffciently small Bond number and the most unstable wave length is expected

linear in the size of the system in various classes of linear max-plus system

result concerns the relationship between matrix and system transients: We prove
that the transient of an NxN matrix A is, up to some constant, equal to the

points lying close to a smooth manifold in high dimension remains a fundamental
problem. One approach consists in recovering a local parameterization using the
local tangent plane. Principal component analysis (PCA) is often the tool of
choice, as it returns an optimal basis in the case of noise-free samples from a
linear subspace. To process noisy data samples from a nonlinear manifold, PCA
must be applied locally, at a scale small enough such that the manifold is
approximately linear, but at a scale large enough such that structure may be
discerned from noise. Using eigenspace perturbation theory and non-asymptotic
random matrix theory, we study the stability of the subspace estimated by PCA
as a function of scale, and bound (with high probability) the angle it forms
with the true tangent space. By adaptively selecting the scale that minimizes
this bound, our analysis reveals an appropriate scale for local tangent plane
recovery. We also introduce a geometric uncertainty principle quantifying the
limits of noise-curvature perturbation for stable recovery. With the purpose of
providing perturbation bounds that can be used in practice, we propose plug-in
estimates that make it possible to directly apply the theoretical results to
real data sets.

description of the heat capacity of ice and water is provided. The heat
capacity of ice is related not only to H2O molecular vibrations, but also to
the molecular rotations. In water, all H2O molecular vibrations, rotations and

term-formers that can bind names in their arguments. It takes a semantics in
(permissive-)nominal sets. In PNL, the forall-quantifier or lambda-binder are
just term-formers satisfying axioms, and their denotation is functions on
nominal atoms-abstraction.
  Then we have higher-order logic (HOL) and its models in ordinary (i.e.
Zermelo-Fraenkel) sets; the denotation of forall or lambda is functions on full
or partial function spaces.
  This raises the following question: how are these two models of binding
connected? What translation is possible between PNL and HOL, and between
nominal sets and functions?
  We exhibit a translation of PNL into HOL, and from models of PNL to certain
models of HOL. It is natural, but also partial: we translate a restricted
subsystem of full PNL to HOL. The extra part which does not translate is the
symmetry properties of nominal sets with respect to permutations. To use a
little nominal jargon: we can translate names and binding, but not their
nominal equivariance properties. This seems reasonable since HOL---and ordinary
sets---are not equivariant.
  Thus viewed through this translation, PNL and HOL and their models do
different things, but they enjoy non-trivial and rich subsystems which are
isomorphic.

arises, a single remainder particle can ""emulsify"" or ""disperse"" the system by
significantly broadening the mean cluster size distribution. This finite-sized

even when the system size is asymptotically large, provided the ratio of the

series of more than eight months from the Kepler satellite. For four of these
stars, we derive atmospheric parameters from spectra acquired with the Nordic
Optical Telescope. The global seismic quantities (average large frequency
separation and frequency of maximum power), combined with the atmospheric
parameters, yield the mean density and surface gravity with precisions of 2%
and ~0.03 dex, respectively. We also determine the radius, mass, and age with
precisions of 2-5%, 7-11%, and ~35%, respectively, using grid-based analyses.
We determine asteroseismic distances to these stars with a precision better
than 10%, and constrain the stellar inclination for three of the stars. An Li
abundance analysis yields an independent estimate of the age, but this is
inconsistent with the asteroseismically determined age for one of the stars. We
compare the results from five different grid-based analyses, and we find that
they all provide radius and mass values to within 2.4sigma. The absence of a
metallicity constraint when the average large frequency separation is measured
with a precision of 1% biases the fitted radius and mass for the stars with
non-solar metallicity (metal-rich KIC 11395018 and metal-poor KIC 10273246),
while including a metallicity constraint reduces the uncertainties in both of
these parameters by almost a factor of two. We found that including the average
small frequency separation improves the determination of the age only for KIC
11395018 and KIC 11234888, and for the latter this improvement was due to the
lack of strong atmospheric constraints. (Abridged).

nucleon-nucleon interaction which satisfies the constraints from the observed
flow data from heavy-ion collisions. The energy density of quark matter is
lower than that of this nuclear EoS at higher densities implying the
possibility of transition to quark matter inside the core. We solve the
Einstein's equations for rotating stars using pure nuclear matter and quark
core. The beta- equilibrated neutron star matter with a thin crust is able to
describe highly massive compact stars but find that the nuclear to quark matter
deconfinement transition inside neutron stars causes reduction in their masses.

Demorest et al. [1] suggest that the masses lie within 1.97\pm0.04 M\odot where
M\odot is the solar mass. In conformity with recent observations, pure
nucleonic EoS determines that the maximum mass of NS rotating with frequency
below r-mode instability is ~1.95 M\odot with radius ~10 kilometers. Although
compact stars with quark cores rotating with Kepler's frequency have masses up
to ~2 M\odot, but if the maximum frequency is limited by the r-mode
instability, the maximum mass ~1.7 M\odot turns out to be lower than the

equations directly, the solution of the initial value problem is used to obtain
the 2D mode structure, following the propagation of wave-packets generated by a
source and reconstructing the time varying field. As application, the 2D WKB
method is applied to investigate the shaping effects (elongation and
triangularity) of tokamak geometry on the lower hybrid wave propagation and
absorbtion. Meanwhile, the Mode Structure Decomposition (MSD) method is used to
handle the boundary conditions and simplify the 2D problem to two nested 1D
problems. The MSD method is related to that discussed earlier by Zonca and Chen
[Phys. Fluids B 5, 3668 (1993)], and reduces to the well-known ""ballooning
formalism"" [J. W. Connor, R. J. Hastie, and J. B. Taylor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 40,
396 (1978)], when spatial scale separation applies. This method is used to
investigate the time varying 2D electrostatic ITG mode structure with a mixed
WKB-full-wave technique. The time varying field pattern is reconstructed and
the time asymptotic structure of the wave-packet propagation gives the 2D
eigenmode and the corresponding eigenvalue. As a general approach to
investigate 2D mode structures in tokamak plasmas, our method also applies for
electromagnetic waves with general source/sink terms, either by an

resonant mode corresponding to the edge mode of the 50 nm dot with slightly
higher damping than that of the unpatterned thin film. With the increase in
areal density of the array both the precession frequency and damping increases
significantly due to the increase in magnetostatic interactions between the
nanodots and a mode splitting and sudden jump in apparent damping are observed
at an edge-to-edge separation of 50 nm.

multiple-output (MIMO) channels is investigated. As a training method a
combination of a pilot-assisted scheme and a biased signaling scheme is
considered. The achievable rates of successive decoding (SD) receivers based on
the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation are analyzed
in the large-system limit, by using the replica method under the assumption of
replica symmetry. It is shown that negligible pilot information is best in
terms of the achievable rates of the SD receivers in the large-system limit.
The obtained analytical formulas of the achievable rates can improve the
existing lower bound on the capacity of the MIMO channel with no channel state
information (CSI), derived by Hassibi and Hochwald, for all signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). The comparison between the obtained bound and a high SNR
approximation of the channel capacity, derived by Zheng and Tse, implies that
the high SNR approximation is unreliable unless quite high SNR is considered.
Energy efficiency in the low SNR regime is also investigated in terms of the
power per information bit required for reliable communication. The required
minimum power is shown to be achieved at a positive rate for the SD receiver
with no CSI, whereas it is achieved in the zero-rate limit for the case of
perfect CSI available at the receiver. Moreover, numerical simulations imply
that the presented large-system analysis can provide a good approximation for
not so large systems. The results in this paper imply that SD schemes can
provide a significant performance gain in the low-to-moderate SNR regimes,
compared to conventional receivers based on one-shot channel estimation.

of a system at zero temperature, the quantum vacua. The gaplessness of fermions
in bulk, on the surface or inside the vortex core is protected by topology.
Irrespective of the deformation of the parameters of the microscopic theory,
the energy spectrum of these fermions remains strictly gapless. This solves the
main hierarchy problem in particle physics. The quantum vacuum of Standard
Model is one of the representatives of topological matter alongside with
topological superfluids and superconductors, topological insulators and
semi-metals, etc. There is a number of of topological invariants in momentum
space of different dimensions. They determine universality classes of the
topological matter and the type of the effective theory which emerges at low
energy, give rise to emergent symmetries, including the effective Lorentz
invariance, and emergent gauge and gravitational fields. The topological
invariants in extended momentum and coordinate space determine the bulk-surface
and bulk-vortex correspondence, connecting the topology in bulk with the real
space. The momentum space topology gives some lessons for quantum gravity. In
effective gravity emerging at low energy, the collective variables are the
tetrad field and spin connections, while the metric is the composite object of
tetrad field. This suggests that the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory with
torsion field is more relevant. There are also several scenarios of Lorentz
invariance violation governed by topology, including splitting of Fermi point
and development of the Dirac points with quadratic and cubic spectrum. The
latter leads to the natural emergence of the Horava-Lifshitz gravity.

field in the Klein-Gordon equation can be made real by a gauge transform,
although charged fields are believed to require complex functions.
Surprisingly, the result can be extended to the Dirac equation: three complex
components of the Dirac spinor function can be algebraically eliminated, and
the remaining component can be made real by a gauge transform. Therefore, the
Dirac equation is generally equivalent to one fourth-order partial differential
equation for one real function (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys. v.52, 082303
(2011)). These results both belong in textbooks and can be used for development
of new efficient methods of quantum chemistry. The matter field can be
algebraically eliminated both in scalar electrodynamics and in spinor
electrodynamics in a certain gauge. The resulting equations describe
independent dynamics of the electromagnetic field, which permits mathematical
simplification and can be useful for interpretation of quantum theory. For
example, in the Bohm interpretation, the electromagnetic field can replace the
wave function as the guiding field. It is also shown that for these equations,
generalized Carleman embedding generates systems of linear equations in the
Hilbert space, which look like second-quantized theories and are equivalent to
the original nonlinear systems on the set of solutions of the latter. Thus, the
relevant local realistic models can be embedded into quantum field theories.
These models are equivalent to scalar electrodynamics and spinor
electrodynamics, so they correctly describe a large body of experimental data.
Although they may need some modifications for better agreement with
experiments, they may be of great interest as ""no drama quantum theories"", as
simple (in principle) as classical electrodynamics. Possible issues with the
Bell theorem are discussed.

  Analysis of a Dense Network",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore one aspect of the structure of a codified legal system at the
national level using a new type of representation to understand the strong or
weak dependencies between the various fields of law. In Part I of this study,
we analyze the graph associated with the network in which each French legal
code is a vertex and an edge is produced between two vertices when a code cites
another code at least one time. We show that this network distinguishes from
many other real networks from a high density, giving it a particular structure
that we call concentrated world and that differentiates a national legal system
(as considered with a resolution at the code level) from small-world graphs
identified in many social networks. Our analysis then shows that a few
communities (groups of highly wired vertices) of codes covering large domains
of regulation are structuring the whole system. Indeed we mainly find a central
group of influent codes, a group of codes related to social issues and a group
of codes dealing with territories and natural resources. The study of this
codified legal system is also of interest in the field of the analysis of real
networks. In particular we examine the impact of the high density on the
structural characteristics of the graph and on the ways communities are
searched for. Finally we provide an original visualization of this graph on an
hemicyle-like plot, this representation being based on a statistical reduction
of dissimilarity measures between vertices. In Part II (a following paper) we
show how the consideration of the weights attributed to each edge in the
network in proportion to the number of citations between two vertices (codes)
allows deepening the analysis of the French legal system.
