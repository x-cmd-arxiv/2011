origin as well as mechanism are the focus of intense research and debate. More
than three decades since their serendipitous discovery, followed by several
breakthroughs from space-borne and ground-based observations, they remain one
of the most interesting astrophysical phenomena yet to be completely
understood. Since the launch of Fermi with its unprecedented energy band width
spanning seven decades, the study of gamma-ray burst research has entered a new
phase. Here we review the current theoretical understanding and observational
highlights of gamma-ray burst astronomy and point out some of the potential
promises of multi-wavelength observations in view of the upcoming ground based

The calculated lifetime of the exciton ground state as a function of the bias

sphere radius ratio alpha and small sphere relative concentration x have
historically been very difficult to determine. Previous research had led to the
prediction that these packings were composed of a few known ""alloy"" phases
including, for example, the AlB2 (hexagonal omega), HgBr2, and AuTe2
structures, and to XYn structures composed of close-packed large spheres with
small spheres (in a number ratio of n to 1) in the interstices, e.g., the NaCl
packing for n = 1. However, utilizing an implementation of the Torquato-Jiao
sphere-packing algorithm [S. Torquato and Y. Jiao, Phys. Rev. E 82, 061302
(2010)], we have discovered that many more structures appear in the densest
packings. For example, while all previously known densest structures were
composed of spheres in small to large number ratios of one to one, two to one,
and very recently three to one, we have identified densest structures with
number ratios of seven to three and five to two. In a recent work [A. B.
Hopkins, Y. Jiao, F. H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107,
125501 (2011)], we summarized these findings. In this work, we present the
structures of the densest-known packings and provide details about their
characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that a broad array of different
densest mechanically stable structures consisting of only two types of
components can form without any consideration of attractive or anisotropic
interactions. In addition, the novel structures that we have identified may
correspond to currently unidentified stable phases of certain binary atomic and
molecular systems, particularly at high temperatures and pressures.

mechanism, a large scale piezoelectric mechanism was assumed that was initiated
in the Izmit seismogenic region long before the EQ occurrence time. The
theoretical analysis of the adopted physical model justifies the generation of
a number of specific electric signals that can be emitted from the focal area
before the rock formation failure. The processing of the registered by the VOL
monitoring site raw data revealed the presence of similar signals as the
expected theoretical ones. Therefore, it is concluded that long before the
Izmit EQ occurrence a large scale piezoelectric mechanism was initiated that
was modulated too by the tidally triggered lithospheric oscillation and
therefore generated the observed preseismic electric signals. The adopted
piezoelectric model provides critical information about the time of occurrence
of the seismogenic area rock formation failure and therefore the possibility
for a real short-term time prediction of a large EQ. The other two predictive
EQ parameters, location and magnitude, are discussed in the frame of electric

plasmas. However, even in the absence of growing eigenmodes, subcritical
fluctuations that grow transiently can lead to sustained turbulence. Here
transient growth of electrostatic fluctuations driven by the parallel velocity
gradient (PVG) and the ion temperature gradient (ITG) in the presence of a
perpendicular ExB velocity shear is considered. The maximally simplified case
of zero magnetic shear is treated in the framework of a local shearing box.
There are no linearly growing eigenmodes, so all excitations are transient. The
maximal amplification factor of initial perturbations and the corresponding
wavenumbers are calculated as functions of q/\epsilon (=safety factor/aspect
ratio), temperature gradient and velocity shear. Analytical results are
corroborated and supplemented by linear gyrokinetic numerical tests. For
sufficiently low values of q/\epsilon (<7 in our model), regimes with fully
suppressed ion-scale turbulence are possible. For cases when turbulence is not
suppressed, an elementary heuristic theory of subcritical PVG turbulence
leading to a scaling of the associated ion heat flux with q, \epsilon, velocity
shear and temperature gradient is proposed; it is argued that the transport is
much less stiff than in the ITG regime.

clearly separated in terms of [alpha/Fe] up to super-solar metallicities. In
turn, high-alpha stars are also separated into two families with a gap in both
[alpha/Fe] ([alpha/Fe] = 0.17) and metallicity ([Fe/H] = -0.2) distributions.
The metal-poor high-alpha stars (thick disk) and metal-rich high-alpha stars

The two alpha-enhanced families have different kinematics and orbital
parameters. The metal-rich alpha-enhanced stars, such as thin disk stars have

that these stars may have been formed in the inner Galactic disk, but their

the relative position relationship of the blocks in one floorplan is the same

  Mosaic floorplans are widely used in VLSI circuit design. An important
problem in this area is to find short binary string representations of the set
of n-block mosaic floorplans. The best known representation is the
""Quarter-State Sequence"" which uses 4n bits. This paper introduces a simple
binary representation of n-block mosaic floorplan using 3n-3 bits. It has been

Bayesian estimators. A fundamental technique that can be used to generate
samples from virtually any target probability distribution is the so-called
rejection sampling method, which generates candidate samples from a proposal
distribution and then accepts them or not by testing the ratio of the target
and proposal densities. The class of adaptive rejection sampling (ARS)
algorithms is particularly interesting because they can achieve high acceptance
rates. However, the standard ARS method can only be used with log-concave
target densities. For this reason, many generalizations have been proposed.
  In this work, we investigate two different adaptive schemes that can be used
to draw exactly from a large family of univariate probability density functions
(pdf's), not necessarily log-concave, possibly multimodal and with tails of
arbitrary concavity. These techniques are adaptive in the sense that every time
a candidate sample is rejected, the acceptance rate is improved. The two
proposed algorithms can work properly when the target pdf is multimodal, with
first and second derivatives analytically intractable, and when the tails are
log-convex in a infinite domain. Therefore, they can be applied in a number of
scenarios in which the other generalizations of the standard ARS fail. Two
illustrative numerical examples are shown.

iterations. However, as these Machines operate in integer space, the standard
notions of a chaotic system is not readily applicable for them. Changing the
state space of Turing Machines from integer to rational space, the condition
for chaotic dynamics can be suitably established, as presented in the current
paper. Further it is deduced that, given random input, computation performed by
a Universal Turing Machine would be 'almost surely' chaotic.

frequency instability of ultra-stable lasers. Using Levin's formulation of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem we correct the analytical estimate for the
spacer contribution given by Numata et al.. For detailed analysis
finite-element calculations of the thermal noise focusing on the spacer

carried out. We find that the increased dissipation close to the contact area
between spacer and mirrors can contribute significantly to the thermal noise.
From an estimate of the support structure contribution we give guidelines for a

thermal expansion can be compensated without deteriorating the thermal noise.

number of ""particles"" in a system over time. While widely used in population
biology, genetics and ecology, statistical inference of the instantaneous
particle birth and death rates remains largely limited to restrictive linear
BDPs in which per-particle birth and death rates are constant. Researchers
often observe the number of particles at discrete times, necessitating data
augmentation procedures such as expectation-maximization (EM) to find maximum
likelihood estimates. The E-step in the EM algorithm is available in
closed-form for some linear BDPs, but otherwise previous work has resorted to
approximation or simulation. Remarkably, the E-step conditional expectations
can also be expressed as convolutions of computable transition probabilities
for any general BDP with arbitrary rates. This important observation, along
with a convenient continued fraction representation of the Laplace transforms
of the transition probabilities, allows novel and efficient computation of the
conditional expectations for all BDPs, eliminating the need for approximation
or costly simulation. We use this insight to derive EM algorithms that yield
maximum likelihood estimation for general BDPs characterized by various rate
models, including generalized linear models. We show that our Laplace
convolution technique outperforms competing methods when available and
demonstrate a technique to accelerate EM algorithm convergence. Finally, we
validate our approach using synthetic data and then apply our methods to
estimation of mutation parameters in microsatellite evolution.

experimentally studied and fundamental systems in physics. There is, however,
lack of theoretical understanding in this field of physics. The ideas based on
the concepts like Kondo lattice and involving quantum and thermal fluctuations
at a quantum critical point have been used to explain the unusual physics.
Alas, being suggested to describe one property, these approaches fail to
explain the others. This means a real crisis in theory suggesting that there is
a hidden fundamental law of nature. It turns out that the hidden fundamental
law is well forgotten old one directly related to the Landau---Migdal
quasiparticles, while the basic properties and the scaling behavior of the
strongly correlated systems can be described within the framework of the
fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT). The phase transition
comprises the extended quasiparticle paradigm that allows us to explain the
non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior observed in these systems. In contrast to the
Landau paradigm stating that the quasiparticle effective mass is a constant,
the effective mass of new quasiparticles strongly depends on temperature,
magnetic field, pressure, and other parameters. Our observations are in good
agreement with experimental facts and show that FCQPT is responsible for the
observed NFL behavior and quasiparticles survive both high temperatures and
high magnetic fields.

  with Unknown Primary Behavior",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks can greatly improve the
spectrum utilization efficiency. Nevertheless, interference may be introduced
to the Primary User (PU) when the Secondary Users (SUs) dynamically utilize the
PU's licensed channels. If the SUs can be synchronous with the PU's time slots,
the interference is mainly due to their imperfect spectrum sensing of the
primary channel. However, if the SUs have no knowledge about the PU's exact
communication mechanism, additional interference may occur. In this paper, we
propose a dynamic spectrum access protocol for the SUs confronting with unknown
primary behavior and study the interference caused by their dynamic access.
Through analyzing the SUs' dynamic behavior in the primary channel which is
modeled as an ON-OFF process, we prove that the SUs' communication behavior is
a renewal process. Based on the Renewal Theory, we quantify the interference
caused by the SUs and derive the corresponding close-form expressions. With the
interference analysis, we study how to optimize the SUs' performance under the
constraints of the PU's communication quality of service (QoS) and the
secondary network's stability. Finally, simulation results are shown to verify
the effectiveness of our analysis.

works concerning the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorem. The study of this theorem has
a long history dating back to Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Latin: Remarkable
Theorem) and culminated in Chern's groundbreaking work [14] in 1944, which is a
deep and wonderful application of Elie Cartan's formalism. The idea and tools
in [14] have a great generalization and continue to produce important results
till today. In this paper, we give four different proofs of the
Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorem on Riemannian manifolds, namely Chern's simple
intrinsic proof, a topological proof, Mathai-Quillen's Thom form proof and
McKean-Singer-Patodi's heat equation proof. These proofs are related with
remarkable developments in differential geometry such as the Chern-Weil theory,
theory of characteristic classes, Mathai-Quillen's formalism and the
Atiyah-Singer index theorem. It is through these brilliant achievements the
great importance and influence of Chern's insights and ideas are shown. Our
purpose here is to use the Gauss- Bonnet-Chern theorem as a guide to expose the
reader to some advanced topics in modern differential geometry.

arises as the asymptotics after a small time. In this respect, the proposed
models can be considered as examples in which the quantum descriptions arise as
approximate ones for certain hypothetical reality. The deviation between the
proposed models and the quantum ones can arise, for example, for processes with
rapidly changing potential function. Under its action the diffusion scattering
process of waves will go out from the states described by quantum mechanics.
  In the paper it is shown that the proposed models of diffusion scattering of

Absorption and initial relaxation takes place over tens of femtoseconds.
Excitonic lifetimes are on the order of a nanosecond. Hopping rates, energy
differences between chromophores, reorganization energies, and decoherence
rates correspond to time scales on the order of picoseconds. The functional
nature of the divergence of time scales is easily understood: strong coupling
to the electromagnetic field over a broad band of frequencies yields rapid
absorption, while long excitonic lifetimes increase the amount of energy that
makes its way to the reaction center to be converted to chemical energy. The
convergence of the remaining time scales to the centerpoint of the overall
temporal range is harder to understand. In this paper we argue that the
convergence of timescales in photosynthesis can be understood as an example of
the `quantum Goldilocks effect': natural selection tends to drive quantum
systems to the degree of quantum coherence that is `just right' for attaining
maximum efficiency. We provide a general theory of optimal and robust,
efficient transport in quantum systems, and show that it is governed by a
single parameter.

obtained at a fitting of (anti)proton-proton experimental data on differential
cross sections from Plab=1 GeV/c up to ISR energies. The fitting gives
extra-ordinary good results, \chi^2/NoF ~ 1 of below at |t|< 1.75 (GeV/c)^2. An
extrapolation of the parameter's energy dependencies to the LHC energies allows
excellent description of the Totem data up to the second diffraction maximum.
Predictions for other LHC energies are presented also. The amplitude provides
one with parameterizations of total and elastic cross sections. Its impact
parameter representation corresponds to the 2-dimensional Fermi-function -
1/[1+exp((b-R)/d)], which is very useful for Glauber calculations of

main-sequence stellar energy distribution (SED) and amount of dust extinction

show that SDSS photometry alone is sufficient to break degeneracies between
intrinsic stellar color and dust amount when the shape of extinction curve is
fixed. When using both SDSS and 2MASS photometry, the ratio of the total to
selective absorption, $R_V$, can be determined with an uncertainty of about 0.1
for most stars in high-extinction regions. These fits enable detailed studies
of the dust properties and its spatial distribution, and of the stellar spatial
distribution at low Galactic latitudes. Our results are in good agreement with
the extinction normalization given by the Schlegel et al. (1998, SFD) dust maps
at high northern Galactic latitudes, but indicate that the SFD extinction map
appears to be consistently overestimated by about 20% in the southern sky, in
agreement with Schlafly et al. (2010). The constraints on the shape of the dust
extinction curve across the SDSS and 2MASS bandpasses support the models by
Fitzpatrick (1999) and Cardelli et al. (1989). For the latter, we find an
$R_V=3.0\pm0.1$(random) $\pm0.1$(systematic) over most of the high-latitude
sky. At low Galactic latitudes (|b|<5), we demonstrate that the SFD map cannot
be reliably used to correct for extinction as most stars are embedded in dust,
rather than behind it. We introduce a method for efficient selection of
candidate red giant stars in the disk, dubbed ""dusty parallax relation"", which
utilizes a correlation between distance and the extinction along the line of

The distinguishing number of G, D(G), is the minimum number of colors in a

chi_D(G), is the minimum number of colors in a distinguishing coloring of G
that is also a proper coloring.
  Recently the notion of a distinguishing coloring was extended to that of a
list distinguishing coloring. Given an assignment L= {L(v) : v in V(G)} of
lists of available colors to the vertices of G, we say that G is (properly)
L-distinguishable if there is a (proper) distinguishing coloring f of G such
that f(v) is in L(v) for all v. The list distinguishing number of G, D_l(G), is
the minimum integer k such that G is L-distinguishable for any list assignment
L with |L(v)| = k for all v. Similarly, the list distinguishing chromatic
number of G, denoted chi_{D_l}(G) is the minimum integer k such that G is
properly L-distinguishable for any list assignment L with |L(v)| = k for all v.
  In this paper, we study these distinguishing parameters for trees, and in
particular extend an enumerative technique of Cheng to show that for any tree

quantization of space-time in 4D Euclidean gravity and is the first example of
a renormalizable model of this kind. Its vertex and propagator are
four-stranded like in 4D group field theories, but without gauge averaging on
the strands. Surprisingly perhaps, the model is of the $\phi^6$ rather than of
the $\phi^4$ type, since two different $\phi^6$-type interactions are
log-divergent, i.e. marginal in the renormalization group sense. The
renormalization proof relies on a multiscale analysis. It identifies all
divergent graphs through a power counting theorem. These divergent graphs have
internal and external structure of a particular kind called melonic. Melonic
graphs dominate the 1/N expansion of colored tensor models and generalize the
planar ribbon graphs of matrix models. A new locality principle is established
for this category of graphs which allows to renormalize their divergences
through counterterms of the form of the bare Lagrangian interactions. The model
also has an unexpected anomalous log-divergent $(\int \phi^2)^2$ term, which
can be interpreted as the generation of a scalar matter field out of pure
gravity.

disproves a conjecture made in Section 3 of [19] and gives the first

small number $t$ of defective items among a large set (of size $N$) of items.
In the non-adaptive scenario the set of tests has to be designed in one-shot.
In this setting, designing a testing scheme is equivalent to the construction
of a \emph{disjunct matrix}, an $M \times N$ matrix where the union of supports
of any $t$ columns does not contain the support of any other column. In
principle, one wants to have such a matrix with minimum possible number $M$ of
rows (tests). One of the main ways of constructing disjunct matrices relies on
\emph{constant weight error-correcting codes} and their \emph{minimum
distance}. In this paper, we consider a relaxed definition of a disjunct matrix
known as \emph{almost disjunct matrix}. This concept is also studied under the
name of \emph{weakly separated design} in the literature. The relaxed
definition allows one to come up with group testing schemes where a
close-to-one fraction of all possible sets of defective items are identifiable.
Our main contribution is twofold. First, we go beyond the minimum distance
analysis and connect the \emph{average distance} of a constant weight code to
the parameters of an almost disjunct matrix constructed from it. Our second
contribution is to explicitly construct almost disjunct matrices based on our
average distance analysis, that have much smaller number of rows than any
previous explicit construction of disjunct matrices. The parameters of our
construction can be varied to cover a large range of relations for $t$ and $N$.

improve upon the SDSS DR7 Petrosian radii and luminosities through the use of
isophotal fits to the galaxy images. This improvement is gauged via VL and RV
relations whose respective scatters are reduced by ~8% and ~30% compared to
similar relations built with SDSS parameters. The tightest VRL relations are
obtained with the i-band radius, R235i, measured at 23.5 mag/arcsec^-2, and the
luminosity L235i, measured within R235i. Our VRL scaling relations compare
well, both in scatter and slope, with similar studies (such comparisons however
depend sensitively on the nature and size of the compared samples). The typical
slopes, b, and observed scatters, sigma, of the i-band VL, RL and RV relations

corresponding polyspectra in the harmonic domain. Using these moments, we
derive analytical expressions for the joint two-point probability distribution

formation and evolution of their host galaxies. However, the formation and
growth of SMBHs are not yet well understood. One of the proposed formation
scenarios is the growth of SMBHs from seed intermediate-mass black holes
(IMBHs, 10^2 to 10^5 M_{\odot}) formed in star clusters. In this context, and
also with respect to the low mass end of the M-sigma relation for galaxies,
globular clusters are in a mass range that make them ideal systems to look for
IMBHs. Among Galactic star clusters, the massive cluster $\omega$ Centauri is a
special target due to its central high velocity dispersion and also its
multiple stellar populations. We study the central structure and dynamics of
the star cluster $\omega$ Centauri to examine whether an IMBH is necessary to
explain the observed velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles. We
perform direct N-body simulations to follow the dynamical evolution of $\omega$
Centauri. The simulations are compared to the most recent data-sets in order to
explain the present-day conditions of the cluster and to constrain the initial
conditions leading to the observed profiles. We find that starting from
isotropic spherical multi-mass King models and within our canonical
assumptions, a model with a central IMBH mass of 2% of the cluster stellar
mass, i.e. a 5x10^4 M_{\odot} IMBH, provides a satisfactory fit to both the
observed shallow cusp in surface brightness and the continuous rise towards the
center of the radial velocity dispersion profile. In our isotropic spherical
models, the predicted proper motion dispersion for the best-fit model is the
same as the radial velocity dispersion one. (abridged)

stars (hereafter He star) in the Galaxy has been noted over the years as a
surprising fact, given the significant number of Galactic HMXBs containing
H-rich donors, which are expected to be their progenitors. This contrast has
further sharpened in light of recent observations uncovering a preponderance of
HMXBs hosting loosely bound Be donors orbiting neutron stars (NS), which would
be expected to naturally evolve into He-HMXBs through dynamical mass transfer
onto the NS and a common-envelope (CE) phase. Hence, reconciling the large
population of Be-HMXBs with the observation of only one He-HMXB can help
constrain the dynamics of CE physics. Here, we use detailed stellar structure
and evolution models and show that binary mergers of HMXBs during CE events
must be common in order to resolve the tension between these observed
populations. We find that, quantitatively, this scenario remains consistent
with the typically adopted energy parameterization of CE evolution, yielding
expected populations which are not at odds with current observations. However,
future observations which better constrain the underlying population of loosely
bound O/B-NS binaries are likely to place significant constraints on the
efficiency of CE ejection.

Using streaklines, we visualise the path of escaping stars and show how
epicyclic motion leads to over- and underdensities in tidal tails of star
clusters moving on circular and eccentric orbits about a galaxy. Additionally,
we investigate the effect of the cluster mass on the tidal tails, by showing
that their structure is better matched when the perturbing effect of the
cluster mass is included. By adjusting streaklines to results of N-body
computations we can accurately and quickly reproduce all observed substructure,
especially the streaky features often found in simulations which may be
interpreted in observations as multiple tidal tails. Hence, we can rule out
tidal shocks as the origin of such substructures. Finally, from the adjusted
streakline parameters we can verify that for the star clusters we studied
escape mainly happens from the tidal radius of the cluster, given by x_L =
(GM/(\Omega^2-\partial^2\Phi/\partial R^2))^{1/3}. We find, however, that there
is another limiting radius, the ""edge"" radius, which gives the smallest radius
from which a star can escape during one cluster orbit about the galaxy. For
eccentric cluster orbits the edge radius shrinks with increasing orbital
eccentricity (for fixed apocentric distance) but is always significantly larger
than the respective perigalactic tidal radius. In fact, the edge radii of the
clusters we investigated, which are extended and tidally filling, agree well
with their (fitted) King radii, which may indicate a fundamental connection
between these two quantities.

analyse the B -> X_{s,d} gamma decays that receive important new contributions
from the W_L-W_R mixing and H^\pm exchanges. Compared to the existing

between various observables that could help us to distinguish this model from
other extensions of the SM and to obtain an insight into the structure of the
mixing matrix V^R that governs right-handed currents. We find that even for

can be very important, even dominant for certain parameters of the model. While
in a large fraction of the parameter space this model has to struggle with the
experimental constraint from epsilon_K, we demonstrate that there exist regions
in parameter space which satisfy all existing Delta F = 2, B -> X_{s,d} gamma,
tree level decays and electroweak precision constraints for scales

stellar surface inhomogeneities or by the radial pull of orbiting planets. We
recover the planetary signals corresponding to 9 planets already announced by
our group (Gl176b, Gl581b, c, d & e, Gl674b, Gl433b, Gl 667Cb and c). We

derive a first estimate of the occurrence of M-dwarf planets as a function of

matter physics, from massless electrons in graphene to the emergence of
conducting edge states in topological insulators [1, 2]. At a Dirac point, two
energy bands intersect linearly and the particles behave as relativistic Dirac
fermions. In solids, the rigid structure of the material sets the mass and
velocity of the particles, as well as their interactions. A different, highly
flexible approach is to create model systems using fermionic atoms trapped in
the periodic potential of interfering laser beams, a method which so far has
only been applied to explore simple lattice structures [3, 4]. Here we report
on the creation of Dirac points with adjustable properties in a tunable
honeycomb optical lattice. Using momentum-resolved interband transitions, we
observe a minimum band gap inside the Brillouin zone at the position of the
Dirac points. We exploit the unique tunability of our lattice potential to
adjust the effective mass of the Dirac fermions by breaking inversion symmetry.
Moreover, changing the lattice anisotropy allows us to move the position of the
Dirac points inside the Brillouin zone. When increasing the anisotropy beyond a
critical limit, the two Dirac points merge and annihilate each other - a
situation which has recently attracted considerable theoretical interest [5-9],
but seems extremely challenging to observe in solids [10]. We map out this
topological transition in lattice parameter space and find excellent agreement
with ab initio calculations. Our results not only pave the way to model
materials where the topology of the band structure plays a crucial role, but
also provide an avenue to explore many-body phases resulting from the interplay
of complex lattice geometries with interactions [11, 12].

the applied magnetic field. Eliminating vortex effects leaves one remaining
feature in the data that corresponds to the Pauli paramagnetic limit ($H_p$).
We propose a semi-empirical method to calculate the $H_p$ in quasi 2D
superconductors. This method takes into account the energy gap of each of the
quasi 2D superconductors, which is calculated from specific heat data, and the
influence of many body effects. The calculated Pauli paramagnetic limits are
then compared to critical field data for the title compound and other organic
conductors. Many of the examined quasi 2D superconductors, including the above
organic superconductors and CeCoIn$_5$, exhibit upper critical fields that
exceed their calculated $H_p$ suggesting unconventional superconductivity. We
show that the high field low temperature state in
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$ is consistent with the Fulde Ferrell Larkin
Ovchinnikov state.

photosynthetic complexes, frequently occurs in regimes where the energy scales
of the system and environment are similar. This situation provides a challenge
to theoretical investigation since most approaches are accurate only when a
certain energetic parameter is small compared to others in the problem. Here we
show that in these difficult regimes, the Ehrenfest approach provides a good
starting point for a dynamical description of the energy transfer process due
to its ability to accurately treat coupling to slow environmental modes. To
further improve on the accuracy of the Ehrenfest approach, we use our reduced
density matrix hybrid framework to treat the faster environmental modes quantum
mechanically, at the level of a perturbative master equation. This combined
approach is shown to provide an efficient and quantitative description of
electronic energy transfer in a model dimer and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson
complex and is used to investigate the effect of environmental preparation on
the resulting dynamics.

types (Types I, II, and III: single-exponential, truncated, and antitruncated),
Virgo S0s appear to be entirely lacking in disk truncations. More specifically,
the fraction of truncations in S0 galaxies with M_B < -17 is 28% +7/-6% for the
field, versus 0% +4/-0% for the Virgo Cluster galaxies; the difference is
significant at the 99.7% level. The discrepancy is made up almost entirely by
Type I profiles, which are almost twice as frequent in the Virgo Cluster as

Yet, finding the right amount of regularization can be challenging, especially

restore this symmetry for the paired quasiparticles. This condition is shown to

simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. The properties
of cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the
temperature has been higher than 10^5.5 K while it was extragalactic, are
clearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial
temperatures >> 10^5 K. The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble
those between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly
confined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium
with the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas
typically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling.
However, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given
mode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong
statements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong
cooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas
accreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback
results in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii.
The gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also
account for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that
cold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high-column density HI
Lyman-alpha absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies.

connects the momentum-dependent amplitude of the d-wave superconducting order
parameter at T\sim0 to quasiparticle scattering mechanisms operative at

marginal Fermi-liquid phenomenology and the inherently strong dissipation of

distinct ""matter"" components, which interact mainly through gravity, and
electromagnetic radiation. The nature of the different components, and possible
interactions, tends to be based on the notion of coupled perfect fluids (or
scalar fields). This approach is somewhat naive, especially if one wants to be
able to consider issues involving heat flow, dissipative mechanisms, or
Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter. We argue that a more natural
starting point would be the multi-purpose variational relativistic multi-fluid
system that has so far mainly been applied to neutron star astrophysics. As an
illustration of the fundamental principles involved, we develop the formalism
for determining the non-linear cosmological solutions to the Einstein equations
for a general relativistic two-fluid model for a coupled system of matter
(non-zero rest mass) and ""radiation"" (zero rest mass). The two fluids are
allowed to interpenetrate and exhibit a relative flow with respect to each
other, implying, in general, an anisotropic Universe. We use initial conditions
such that the massless fluid flux dominates early on so that the situation is
effectively that of a single fluid and one has the usual
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. We find that there is a
Bianchi I transition epoch out of which the matter flux dominates. The
situation is then effectively that of a single fluid and the spacetime evolves
towards the FLRW form. Such a transition opens up the possibility of imprinting
observable consequences at the specific scale corresponding to the transition
time.

predefined threshold values, the secondary user will send one (or several) bit
of information to the fusion center. The fusion center asynchronously receives
the bits from different secondary users and updates the global sensing decision
statistic to perform a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), to reach a
sensing decision. We provide an asymptotic analysis for the above scheme, and
under different conditions, we compare it against the cooperative sensing

approach for analyzing multiscale behavior of the photospheric magnetic flux
underlying this dynamics as depicted by a sequence of high-resolution solar
magnetograms. The approach involves two basic processing steps: (1)
identification of timing and location of magnetic flux origin and demise events
(as defined by DeForest et al., 2007) by tracking spatiotemporal evolution of
unipolar and bipolar photospheric regions, and (2) analysis of collective
behavior of the detected magnetic events using a generalized version of
Grassberger - Procaccia correlation integral algorithm. The scale-free nature
of the developed algorithms makes it possible to characterize the dynamics of
the photospheric network across a wide range of distances and relaxation times.
Three types of photospheric conditions are considered to test the method: a
quiet photosphere, a solar active region (NOAA 10365) in a quiescent
non-flaring state, and the same active region during a period of M-class
flares. The results obtained show (1) the presence of a topologically complex
asymmetrically fragmented magnetic network in the quiet photosphere driven by
meso- and supergranulation, (2) the formation of non-potential magnetic
structures with complex polarity separation lines inside the active region, and
(3) statistical signatures of canceling bipolar magnetic structures coinciding
with flaring activity in the active region. Each of these effects can represent
an unstable magnetic configuration acting as an energy source for coronal
dissipation and heating.

know about the classical state? We show that in most respects, it would appear
to us as quantum. The statistical theory of classical mechanics, which
specifies how probability distributions over phase space evolve under
Hamiltonian evolution and under measurements, is typically called Liouville
mechanics, so the theory we explore here is Liouville mechanics with an
epistemic restriction. The particular epistemic restriction we posit as our
foundational postulate specifies two constraints. The first constraint is a
classical analogue of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle -- the second-order
moments of position and momentum defined by the phase-space distribution that
characterizes an agent's knowledge are required to satisfy the same constraints
as are satisfied by the moments of position and momentum observables for a
quantum state. The second constraint is that the distribution should have
maximal entropy for the given moments. Starting from this postulate, we derive
the allowed preparations, measurements and transformations and demonstrate that
they are isomorphic to those allowed in Gaussian quantum mechanics and generate
the same experimental statistics. We argue that this reconstruction of Gaussian
quantum mechanics constitutes additional evidence in favour of a research
program wherein quantum states are interpreted as states of incomplete
knowledge, and that the phenomena that do not arise in Gaussian quantum
mechanics provide the best clues for how one might reconstruct the full quantum
theory.

allowing the propagation of the transverse spin 1/2 component present in the
reducible Rarita-Schwinger vector-spinor. This is done by allowing a more
general form for the mass term, while leaving the kinetic terms untouched. We
find that the interaction is consistent and does not lead to superluminal
propagation for a range of the mass of the spin 1/2 particle, except for the
special point where the spin 1/2 particle is infinitely massive. We then
quantize the theory using the appropriate Grassmann-variable path integral and
study the poles of the propagator. The unfamiliar feature of the theory is that
the charge matrix is not positive definite; it is positive definite on the
space of spin 3/2 solutions, and negative definite on the space of spin 1/2
solutions. Classically, for spin 1/2 modes the energy is of the opposite sign
to frequency, i.e. the positive frequency modes have negative energy. It is
found that the retarded part appropriately propagates the positive energy
solutions forward in time, while the advanced part propagates the negative
energy solutions back in time so long as the free parameter is chosen such that
the positive frequency modes have the same parity. The propagator contains
poles of the spin 1/2 modes above the real axis for the positive and below the
real axis for the negative frequency modes, while the residues at those poles
are also of the sign opposite to the usual; altogether this leads to a unitary
S-matrix, the forward amplitude <p|p> being positive for all modes. The
canonically quantized field is causal, and the equal-time anti-commutator has
positive definite form. We choose the physical vacuum as the highest-weight
state with respect to the spin 1/2 operators in order to have positive energy,
and to correctly reproduce both the unusual residues and locations of the
poles.

improve the sensing performance via exploiting the spatial diversity of the
secondary users. In this study, a new selfishness issue is identified, that
selfish users sense no spectrum in collaborative sensing. For easier
presentation, it's denoted as entropy selfishness. This selfish behavior is
difficult to distinguish, making existing detection based incentive schemes
fail to work. To thwart entropy selfishness in distributed collaborative
sensing, we propose YouSense, a One-Time Pad (OTP) based incentive design that
could naturally isolate entropy selfish users from the honest users without
selfish node detection. The basic idea of YouSense is to construct a trapdoor
one-time pad for each sensing report by combining the original report and a
random key. Such a one-time pad based encryption could prevent entropy selfish
users from accessing the original sensing report while enabling the honest
users to recover the report. Different from traditional cryptography based OTP
which requires the key delivery, YouSense allows an honest user to recover the
pad (or key) by exploiting a unique characteristic of collaborative sensing
that different secondary users share some common observations on the same radio
spectrum. We further extend YouSense to improve the recovery successful rate by
reducing the cardinality of set of the possible pads. By extensive USRP based
experiments, we show that YouSense can successfully thwart entropy selfishness
with low system overhead.

that proceeds by sequential measurements of individual spins in an entangled
resource state. However, it remains a challenge to produce efficiently such
resource states. Would it be possible to generate these states by simply
cooling a quantum many-body system to its ground state? Cluster states, the
canonical resource states for MBQC, do not occur naturally as unique ground
states of physical systems. This inherent hurdle has led to a significant
effort to identify alternative resource states that appear as ground states in
spin lattices. Recently, some interesting candidates have been identified with
various valence-bond-solid (VBS) states. In this review, we provide a
pedagogical introduction to recent progress regarding MBQC with VBS states as
possible resource states. This study has led to an interesting
interdisciplinary research area at the interface of quantum information science
and condensed matter physics.

using this method in the Mott and the superfluid phases and compare our results
with mean-field theory. We also show that the same method may be used to
analyze the non-equilibrium dynamics of the model both in the Mott phase and
near the superfluid-insulator quantum critical point where the hopping
amplitude $J$ and the on-site interaction $U$ satisfy $z_0J/U \ll 1$. In
particular, we study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the model both subsequent
to a sudden quench of the hopping amplitude $J$ and during a ramp from $J_i$ to
$J_f$ characterized by a ramp time $\tau$ and exponent $\alpha$: $J(t)=J_i
+(J_f-J_i) (t/\tau)^{\alpha}$. We compute the wavefunction overlap $F$, the
residual energy $Q$, the superfluid order parameter $\Delta(t)$, the equal-time
order parameter correlation function $C(t)$, and the defect formation
probability $P$ for the above-mentioned protocols and provide a comparison of
our results to their mean-field counterparts. We find that $Q$, $F$, and $P$ do
not exhibit the expected universal scaling. We explain this absence of

  We present an alternative method, which we call coset sum, for constructing

shares many essential features of the tensor product that make it attractive in
practice: (1) it preserves the biorthogonality of univariate refinement masks,
(2) it preserves the accuracy number of the univariate refinement mask, and (3)
the wavelet system associated with it has fast algorithms for computing and
inverting the wavelet coefficients. The coset sum can even provide a wavelet
system with faster algorithms in certain cases than the tensor product. These
features of the coset sum suggest that it is worthwhile to develop and practice
alternative methods to the tensor product for constructing multivariate wavelet
systems. Some experimental results using 2-D images are presented to illustrate
our findings.

spectra are drawn from our ongoing survey in the GOODS fields with the Keck
DEIMOS spectrograph, and we have augmented our sample with published data taken
with FORS2 on the VLT. In general we find similar trends in the spectral
diagnostics to those found in the earlier, more extensive survey of LBGs at z=3
undertaken by Shapley et al (2003). Specifically, we find low-ionization
absorption lines which trace the presence of neutral outflowing gas are weaker
in galaxies with stronger Lyman-alpha emission, bluer UV spectral slopes, lower
stellar masses, lower UV luminosities and smaller half-light radii. This is
consistent with a physical picture whereby star formation drives outflows of
neutral gas which scatters Lyman-alpha and gives rise to strong low-ionization
absorption lines, while increasing the stellar mass, size, metallicity, and
dust content of galaxies. Typical galaxies are thus expected to have stronger
Lyman-alpha emission and weaker low-ionization absorption at earlier times
(higher redshifts). Indeed, our mean spectrum at z=4 shows somewhat weaker
low-ionization absorption lines than at z=3 and available data at higher
redshift indicates a rapid decrease in low-ionization absorption strength with
redshift. We argue that the reduced low-ionization absorption is likely caused
by a decrease in the covering fraction and/or velocity range of outflowing
neutral gas at earlier epochs. Our continuing survey will enable us to extend
these diagnostics more reliably to higher redshift and determine the
implications for the escape fraction of ionizing photons which governs the role
of early galaxies in cosmic reionization. [Abridged]

polarimetric observation was carried out with the 8.2-m Subaru telescope at
I-band. From the observation, the degree of circular polarization V was
measured to be V=1.1+/-2.0%, or |V|<4.3% (90% confidence). The relatively large
uncertainty was due to the faintness of the source (I=23.4-24.0). Considering
the currently suggested models for optical emission from magnetars, our result
is not sufficiently conclusive to discriminate the models. We suggest that
because linear polarization is expected to be strong in the models, linear
polarimetry of this magnetar should be conducted.

considering an electron flux which is captured into the well region. The
process is assisted by the emission of the longitudinal optical phonons as

exhibits transits consistent with three separate planets -- a Super-Earth, a
Jupiter, and a Saturn -- lying very nearly in a 1:2:5 resonance, respectively.
We used the Kepler public data archive and observations with the Gran
Telescopio de Canarias to compile the necessary photometry. For the largest
candidate planet (KOI 806.02) in this system, we detected a large transit
timing variation of -103.5$\pm$6.9 minutes against previously published
ephemeris. We did not obtain a strong detection of a transit color signature
consistent with a planet-sized object; however, we did not detect a color
difference in transit depth, either. The large TTV is consistent with
theoretical predictions that exoplanets in resonance can produce large transit
timing variations, particularly if the orbits are eccentric. The presence of
large TTVs among the bodies in this systems indicates that KOI806 is very
likely to be a planetary system. This is supported by the lack of a strong
color dependence in the transit depth, which would suggest a blended eclipsing
binary.

an object is articulated in front of a camera. IAMs arise in a variety of image
processing and computer vision applications, where they provide a natural
low-dimensional embedding of the collection of high-dimensional images. To date
IAMs have been studied as embedded submanifolds of Euclidean spaces.
Unfortunately, their promise has not been realized in practice, because real
world imagery typically contains sharp edges that render an IAM
non-differentiable and hence non-isometric to the low-dimensional parameter
space under the Euclidean metric. As a result, the standard tools from
differential geometry, in particular using linear tangent spaces to transport
along the IAM, have limited utility. In this paper, we explore a nonlinear
transport operator for IAMs based on the optical flow between images and
develop new analytical tools reminiscent of those from differential geometry
using the idea of optical flow manifolds (OFMs). We define a new metric for
IAMs that satisfies certain local isometry conditions, and we show how to use
this metric to develop a new tools such as flow fields on IAMs, parallel flow
fields, parallel transport, as well as a intuitive notion of curvature. The
space of optical flow fields along a path of constant curvature has a natural
multi-scale structure via a monoid structure on the space of all flow fields
along a path. We also develop lower bounds on approximation errors while
approximating non-parallel flow fields by parallel flow fields.

immune to number fluc- tuations, using the generalized Moore-Penrose inverse to
normalize the phase-quadrature operator. We also obtain a phase-squeezing
criterion that is immune to number fluctuations using similar techniques. These
are utilized to obtain an operational definition of relative phase-measurement
sensitivity, via analysis of phase measurement in interferometry. We show that
these measures are proportional to enhanced phase-measurement sensitivity. The
phase-entanglement criterion is a hallmark for a new type of quantum squeezing,
namely planar quantum squeezing. This has the property that it squeezes two
orthogonal spin directions simultaneously, which is possible owing to the fact
that the SU(2) group that describes spin symmetry has a three-dimensional
parameter space, of higher dimension than the group for photonic quadratures.
The practical advantage of planar quantum squeezing is that, unlike
conventional spin-squeezing, it allows noise reduction over all phase-angles
simultaneously. The application of this type of squeezing is to quantum
measure- ment of an unknown phase. We show that a completely unknown phase
requires two orthogonal measurements, and that with planar quantum squeezing it
is possible to reduce the measurement uncertainty independently of the unknown
phase value. This is a different type of squeezing to the usual spin-squeezing
interferometric criterion, which is only applicable when the measured phase is
already known to a good approximation, or can be measured iteratively. As an
example, we calcu- late the phase-entanglement of the ground state of a
two-well, coupled Bose-Einstein condensate, similar to recent experiments. This
system demonstrates planar squeezing in both the attractive and repulsive
interaction regimes.

constructed a field-based model for aggregated-fish dynamics, deriving
effective interactions for both social and external stimuli from experiments.

quantified the importance of social interactions in the aggregation, providing
an explanation for the spatial structure of fish aggregations found around
floating objects. Our results can be generalized to other gregarious species

yr$^{-1}$ and an energy release of $W\sim 3\times 10^{52}$ erg per capture, can
result in hot plasma injecting into the Galactic halo at a wind velocity of
$u\sim 10^8$ cm s$^{-1}$. The periodic injection of hot plasma can produce a
series of shocks. Energetic protons in the bubble are re-accelerated when they
interact with these shocks. We show that for energy larger than $E> 10^{15}$
eV, the acceleration process can be better described by the stochastic
second-order Fermi acceleration.
  We propose that hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) within the ``knee'' of the
observed CR spectrum are produced by Galactic supernova remnants distributed in
the Galactic disk. Re-acceleration of these particles in the Fermi Bubble
produces CRs beyond the knee. With a mean CR diffusion coefficient in this
energy range in the bubble $D_B\sim 3\times 10^{30}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, we can
reproduce the spectral index of the spectrum beyond the knee and within. The
conversion efficiency from shock energy of the bubble into CR energy is about
10\%. This model provides a natural explanation of the observed CR flux,
spectral indices, and matching of spectra at the knee.

(BV) formalism in the framework of locally covariant field theory. In the first
part of the thesis the classical theory is investigated with a particular focus
on the infinite dimensional character of the underlying structures. It is shown
that the use of infinite dimensional differential geometry allows for a
conceptually clear and elegant formulation. The construction of the BV complex
is performed in a fully covariant way and we also generalize the BV framework
to a more abstract level, using functors and natural transformations. In this
setting we construct the BV complex for classical gravity. This allows us to
give a homological interpretation to the notion of diffeomorphism invariant
physical quantities in general relativity.
  The second part of the thesis concerns the quantum theory. We provide a
framework for the BV quantization that doesn't rely on the path integral
formalism, but is completely formulated within perturbative algebraic quantum
field theory. To make such a formulation possible we first prove that the
renormalized time-ordered product can be understood as a binary operation on a
suitable domain. Using this result we prove the associativity of this product
and provide a consistent framework for the renormalized BV structures. In
particular the renormalized quantum master equation and the renormalized
quantum BV operator are defined. To give a precise meaning to theses objects we
make a use of the master Ward identity, which is an important structure in
causal perturbation theory.

perceive them as monolithic systems which, seen from the outside, exhibit a
uniform behaviour as opposed to many components displaying many local
behaviours that together constitute the system's global behaviour. This level
of abstraction is often reasonable, hiding implementation details from users
who may want to specify the system's global behaviour in terms of an LTL
formula. However, the problem that arises then is how such a specification can
actually be monitored in a distributed system that has no central data
collection point, where all the components' local behaviours are observable. In
this case, the LTL specification needs to be decomposed into sub-formulae
which, in turn, need to be distributed amongst the components' locally attached
monitors, each of which sees only a distinct part of the global behaviour. The
main contribution of this paper is an algorithm for distributing and monitoring
LTL formulae, such that satisfac- tion or violation of specifications can be
detected by local monitors alone. We present an implementation and show that
our algorithm introduces only a minimum delay in detecting
satisfaction/violation of a specification. Moreover, our practical results show
that the communication overhead introduced by the local monitors is
considerably lower than the number of messages that would need to be sent to a

studies using x rays reveal that the compound crystallizes in tetragonal $I
4/m$ structure with lattice parameters, $a$ = 5.4609(2) \AA and $c$ = 7.7113(7)
\AA. The temperature dependent powder x ray studies reveal no structural phase
transition in the temperature range 10 -- 300 K. However, the unit cell volume
shows an anomaly coinciding with the magnetic transition temperature thereby
suggesting a close connection between lattice and magnetism. Neutron
diffraction studies and subsequent bond valence sums analysis show that in
Sr$_{2}$FeCoO$_{6}$, the $B$ site is randomly occupied by Fe and Co in the
mixed valence states of Fe$^{3+}$/Fe$^{4+}$ and Co$^{3+}$/Co$^{4+}$. The random
occupancy and mixed valence sets the stage for inhomogeneous magnetic exchange
interactions and in turn, for the spin glass like state in this double
perovskite which is observed as an irreversibility in temperature dependent dc
magnetization at $T_f\sim$ 75 K. Thermal hysteresis observed in the
magnetization profile of Sr$_{2}$FeCoO$_{6}$ is indicative of the mixed
magnetic phases present. The dynamic magnetic susceptibility displays
characteristic frequency dependence and confirms the spin glass nature of this
material. Dynamical scaling analysis of $\chi'(T)$ yields a critical
temperature $T_{ct}$ = 75.14(8) K and an exponent $z\nu$ = 6.2(2) typical for
spin glasses. The signature of presence of mixed magnetic interactions is
obtained from the thermal hysteresis in magnetization of Sr$_{2}$FeCoO$_{6}$.
Combining the neutron and magnetization results of Sr$_2$FeCoO$_6$, we deduce
the spin states of Fe to be in low spin while that of Co to be in low spin and
intermediate spin.

examine how the excitation properties of the core vary in response to the

surrounding nucleobases often participate in a transition of Thy-related
excitations affecting their composition, absorption energy, and oscillator
strength. In the second part, we take into account geometrically induced
variation of the excitation properties of various B-DNA segments, e.g. di-Thy,
dTpdT etc., obtained from different sources (ideal and 3BSE). It is found that
the transition origin of several Thy-related excitations of these segments is
sensitive to slight conformational variations, suggesting that DNA with thermal

and chemistry of the outflows from AGB stars as a function of chemical
composition and initial mass.
  We used the HIFI instrument to observe nine AGB stars, mainly in the H2O and
high rotational CO lines We investigate the correlation between line
luminosity, line ratio and mass-loss rate, line width and excitation energy.
  A total of nine different molecules, along with some of their isotopologues
have been identified, covering a wide range of excitation temperature. Maser
emission is detected in both the ortho- and para-H2O molecules. The line
luminosities of ground state lines of ortho- and para-H2O, the high-J CO and
NH3 lines show a clear correlation with mass-loss rate. The line ratios of H2O
and NH3 relative to CO J=6-5 correlate with the mass-loss rate while ratios of
higher CO lines to the 6-5 is independent of it. In most cases, the expansion
velocity derived from the observed line width of highly excited transitions
formed relatively close to the stellar photosphere is lower than that of lower
excitation transitions, formed farther out, pointing to an accelerated outflow.
In some objects, the vibrationally excited H2O and SiO which probe the
acceleration zone suggests the wind reaches its terminal velocity already in
the innermost part of the envelope, i.e., the acceleration is rapid.
Interestingly, for R Dor we find indications of a deceleration of the outflow
in the region where the material has already escaped from the star.

clusters until the radius reaches the northwest radio relic. The temperature
drops sharply from 5 keV to about 2 keV at the northwest radio relic region.
The sharp changes of the temperature can be interpreted as a shock with a Mach
number of about 2.5. The entropy slope becomes flatter in the outer region and
negative around the radio relic region. In this region, the relaxation
timescale of electron-ion Coulomb collisions is longer than the time elapsed
after the shock heating and the plasma may be out of equilibrium. Using

that is, a projective object in the category of sets. In constructive ZF (CZF)
the existence of enough projective sets has been discussed as an additional
axiom taken from the interpretation of CZF in Martin-Loef's intuitionistic type
theory. On the other hand, every non-empty set is injective in classical ZF,
which argument fails to work in CZF. The aim of this paper is to shed some
light on the problem whether there are (enough) injective sets in CZF.
  We show that no two element set is injective unless the law of excluded
middle is admitted for negated formulas, and that the axiom of power set is
required for proving that there are strongly enough injective sets. The latter
notion is abstracted from the singleton embedding into the power set, which
ensures enough injectives both in every topos and in IZF. We further show that
it is consistent with CZF to assume that the only injective sets are the
singletons. In particular, assuming the consistency of CZF one cannot prove in
CZF that there are enough injective sets. As a complement we revisit the
duality between injective and projective sets from the point of view of
intuitionistic type theory.

  Streaming",,,,,"cs.NI cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper aims to reduce the prebuffering requirements, while maintaining
continuity, for video streaming. Current approaches do this by making use of
adaptive media playout (AMP) to reduce the playout rate. However, this
introduces playout distortion to the viewers and increases the viewing latency.
We approach this by proposing a frame rate optimization framework that adjusts
both the encoder frame generation rate and the decoder playout frame rate.
Firstly, we model this problem as the joint adjustment of the encoder frame
generation interval and the decoder playout frame interval. This model is used
with a discontinuity penalty virtual buffer to track the accumulated difference
between the receiving frame interval and the playout frame interval. We then
apply Lyapunov optimization to the model to systematically derive a pair of
decoupled optimization policies. We show that the occupancy of the
discontinuity penalty virtual buffer is correlated to the video discontinuity
and that this framework produces a very low playout distortion in addition to a
significant reduction in the prebuffering requirements compared to existing
approaches. Secondly, we introduced a delay constraint into the framework by
using a delay accumulator virtual buffer. Simulation results show that the the
delay constrained framework provides a superior tradeoff between the video
quality and the delay introduced compared to the existing approach. Finally, we
analyzed the impact of delayed feedback between the receiver and the sender on
the optimization policies. We show that the delayed feedbacks have a minimal
impact on the optimization policies.

dynamics to the closed Friedman--Robertson--Walker cosmological model filled
with a minimally coupled massive scalar field. This model is interesting for
studying relational dynamics in a more general setting because (i) it features
a nontrivial coupling of the relational clock to the evolving degrees of
freedom, (ii) no temporally global clock variable exists, and (iii) it is
nonintegrable which is typical for generic dynamical systems. The effective
approach is especially well geared for addressing the concept of relational
evolution in this context, since it enables one to switch between different
clocks and yields a consistent (temporally) local time evolution with transient
observables so long as semiclassicality holds. We provide evidence that
relational evolution in this model universe, while possible for sufficiently
semiclassical states, generically breaks down in the region of maximal
expansion. This is rooted in a defocusing of classical trajectories, which
leads to a rapid spreading of states that are initially sharply peaked and to a
mixing of internal time directions in this region. These results are
qualitatively compared to previous work on this model, revisiting conceptual
issues that have been raised earlier in the literature.

with telescopes at ESO, the SAAO and the AAT between 1982 and 2011 which show a
slow decline in dust emission from the previously reported outburst in 1978--79
until about 1997, when significant dust emission was still evident. This was
followed by a slow rise, accelerating to reach and overtake the first (1978)
photometry, demonstrating that the outburst observed in 1978--79 was not an
isolated event, but that they recur at intervals of 32+ years. This suggests
that WR 48a is a long-period dust maker and colliding-wind binary (CWB). The
locus of WR 48a in the (H-L), K colour-magnitude diagram implies that the rate
of dust formation fell between 1979 and about 1997 and then increased steadily
until 2011. Superimposed on the long-term variation are secondary (`mini')
eruptions in (at least) 1990, 1994, 1997, 1999 and 2004, characteristic of
relatively brief episodes of additional dust formation. Spectra show evidence
for an Oe or Be companion to the WC8 star, supporting the suggestion that WR
48a is a binary system and indicating a system luminosity consistent with the
association of WR 48a and the young star clusters Danks 1 and Danks 2. The
range of dust formation suggests that these stars are in an elliptical orbit
having e ~ 0.6. The size of the orbit implied by the minimum period, together
with the WC wind velocity and likely mass-loss rate, implies that the
post-shock WC wind is adiabatic throughout the orbit -- at odds with the
observed dust formation. A similar conflict is observed in the `pinwheel'
dust-maker WR 112.

show that key premises required in the standard demonstration of the theorem do

conclude that the up FCNC type models cannot explain the $\Delta A_{CP}$ while

propagation speeds ranging from 430-780 km/s in different directions. The
primary coronal wave runs in front of the expanding loops involved in the CME
and its propagation speeds are approximately constant within 10-20 minutes.
Upon arrival at an AR on its path, the primary EUV wave apparently disappears
and a secondary wave rapidly reemerges 75 Mm within the AR boundary at a
similar speed. When the EUV wave encounters a coronal bright structure, an
additional wave front appears there and propagates in front of it at a velocity
nearly a factor of 2 faster. Reflected waves from a polar CH and a coronal
bright structure are observed and propagate fractionally slower than the
primary waves. Some of these phenomena can be equally explained by either a
wave or non-wave model alone. However, taken together, these observations
provide new evidence for the multitudes of global EUV waves, in which a true
MHD fast-mode wave or shock propagates in front of an expanding CME bubble.

introduce systematic biases in, e.g., the determination of the stellar initial
mass function. Post-main-sequence evolution is often associated with irregular
variations of stellar properties on ultra-short time-scales. Examples are
asymptotic giant branch stars and luminous blue variables, both of which are
poorly treated in the models. Stars rarely form in isolation, and the fraction
of truly single stars may be very small. Therefore, stellar multiplicity must
be accounted for since many systems will develop tidal interaction over the
course of their evolution. Last but not least, stellar rotation can drastically
increase stellar temperatures and luminosities, which in turn leads to revised

universe galaxy UGC9837. In nearby galaxies, like the galaxy in question here,
the spatial distribution of the physical properties can be studied in detail,
providing benchmarks for galaxy formation models.
  Aims. Our aim is to derive detailed and spatially resolved physical
properties of the ionised gas of UGC 9837. In addition, we derive an integrated
spectrum of the galaxy and study how varying spatial coverage affects the
derived integrated properties. We also study how the same properties would be
seen if the galaxy was placed at a higher redshift and observed as part of one
of the high-z surveys.
  Methods. UGC9837 was observed using the PMAS PPAK integral field unit. The
spectra are reduced and calibrated and the stellar and ionised components
separated. Using strong emission line ratios of the ionised gas, the source of
ionisation, the dust extinction, the star formation rate, the electron density
and the oxygen abundance derived from a total integrated spectrum, central
integrated spectrum and individual fibre spectra are studied. Finally, the same
properties are studied in a spectrum whose spatial resolution is degraded to
simulate high-z observations.
  Results. The spatial distribution of the ionised gas properties is consistent
with inside-out growing scenario of galaxies. We also find that lack of spatial
coverage would bias the results derived from the integrated spectrum leading,
e.g., to an under-estimation of ionisation and over-estimation of metallicity,
if only the centre of the galaxy was covered by the spectrum. Our simulation of
high-z observations shows that part of the spatial information, such as dust
and SFR distribution would be lost while shallower gradients in metallicity and
ionisation strength would be detected.

light holes states, respectively. The spin lifetime of holes at the top of the
valence band is found to be ~0.5 ps and it is governed by transitions between
heavy and light hole states. Electrons at the bottom of the conduction band, on
the other hand, have a spin lifetime that exceeds 5 ns below 150 K. Theoretical
analysis of the electrons spin relaxation indicates that phonon-induced
intervalley scattering dictates the spin lifetime.

contributes rather less to the brightness of CS J=2-1 lines. If abundances are

then decreases more slowly with $H$ when vortices or antivortices are forced

vortices or antivortices are preferentially nucleated at the inner corners of

Disc field--while the other is offset by ~18' and samples the Warp in the
stellar disc. The CMDs based on HST/ACS imaging reach old main-sequence
turn-offs (~12.5 Gyr). We apply the CMD-fitting technique to the Warp field to
reconstruct the star formation history (SFH). We find that after undergoing
roughly constant SF until about 4.5 Gyr ago, there was a rapid decline in
activity and then a ~1.5 Gyr lull, followed by a strong burst lasting 1.5 Gyr
and responsible for 25% of the total stellar mass in this field. This burst
appears to be accompanied by a decline in metallicity which could be a
signature of the inflow of metal-poor gas. The onset of the burst (~3 Gyr ago)
corresponds to the last close passage of M31 and M33 as predicted by detailed
N-body modelling, and may have been triggered by this event. We reprocess the
deep M33 outer disc field data of Barker et al. (2011) in order to compare
consistently-derived SFHs. This reveals a similar duration burst that is
exactly coeval with that seen in the M31 Warp field, lending further support to
the interaction hypothesis. The complex SFHs and the smoothly-varying
age-metallicity relations suggest that the stellar populations observed in the
far outer discs of both galaxies have largely formed in situ rather than
migrated from smaller galactocentric radii. The strong differential reddening
affecting the CMD of the Outer Disc field prevents derivation of the SFH.
Instead, we quantify this reddening and find that the fine-scale distribution
of dust precisely follows that of the HI gas. This indicates that the outer HI
disc of M31 contains a substantial amount of dust and therefore suggests
significant metal enrichment in these parts, consistent with inferences from
our CMD analysis.

follows if we consider the $j$-invariant and relate it with the polynomial
equation's coefficients. The form of the solution is a relation of
Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. The inverse technique can also be used for
the evaluation of the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, in which the
equation is not now the depressed equation but another quite more simplified
equation.

has been associated with psychiatric illnesses such as depression and
schizophrenia, as well as economic uncertainty, and social/cultural factors.
This study proposes a neuroeconomic framework of suicide. Neuroeconomic
parameters (e.g., risk-attitude, probability weighting, time discounting in
intertemporal choice, and loss aversion) are predicted to be related to
suicidal behavior. Neurobiological and neuroendocrinological substrates such as
serotonin, dopamine, cortisol (HPA axis), nitric oxide, serum cholesterol,
epinephrine, norepinephrine, gonadal hormones (e.g., estradiol and
progesterone), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in brain regions such as the
orbitofrontal/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and limbic regions (e.g., the
amygdala) may supposedly be related to the neuroeconomic parameters modulating
the risk of suicide. The present framework puts foundations for ""molecular
neuroeconomics"" of decision-making processes underlying suicidal behavior.

  in adults",,"Neuro Endocrinol Lett. 2010;31(5):616-621",,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objectives: Stress hormones have been associated with temporal discounting.
Although time-discount rate is shown to be stable over a long term, no study to
date examines whether individual differences in stress hormones could predict
individuals' time-discount rates in the relatively distant future (e.g., six
month later), which is of interest in neuroeconomics of stress-addiction
association.
  Methods: We assessed 87 participants' salivary stress hormone (cortisol,
cortisone, and alpha-amylase) levels and hyperbolic discounting of delayed
rewards consisting of three magnitudes, at the time-interval of six months. For
salivary steroid assays, we employed a liquid chromatography/ mass spectroscopy
(LC/MS) method. The correlations between the stress hormone levels and
time-discount rates were examined.
  Results: We observed that salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) levels were negatively
associated with time-discount rates in never-smokers. Notably, salivary levels
of stress steroids (i.e., cortisol and cortisone) negatively and positively
related to time-discount rates in men and women, respectively, in
never-smokers. Ever-smokers' discount rates were not predicted from these
stress hormone levels.
  Conclusions: Individual differences in stress hormone levels predict
impulsivity in temporal discounting in the future. There are sex differences in
the effect of stress steroids on temporal discounting; while there was no sex
defference in the relationship between sAA and temporal discounting.

punishment. However, to date, little is known regarding the relationship
between depression and intertemporal choice for gain and loss. We compared
impulsivity and inconsistency in intertemporal choice for monetary gain and
loss (quantified with parameters in the q-exponential discount function based
on Tsallis' statistics) between depressive patients and healthy control
subjects. This examination is potentially important for advances in
neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice, because depression is associated with
reduced serotonergic activities in the brain. We observed that depressive
patients were more impulsive and time-inconsistent in intertemporal choice
action for gain and loss, in comparison to healthy controls. The usefulness of
the q-exponential discount function for assessing the impaired decision-making
by depressive patients was demonstrated. Furthermore, biophysical mechanisms
underlying the altered intertemporal choice by depressive patients are
discussed in relation to impaired serotonergic neural systems.
