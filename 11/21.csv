selection, termed topopatric, have recently been shown to describe the observed
patterns of abundance distributions and species-area relationships. Previous
works have considered this type of process only in the context of hermaphrodic
populations. In this work we extend a hermaphroditic model of topopatric
speciation to populations where individuals are explicitly separated into males
and females. We show that for a particular carrying capacity speciation occurs
under similar conditions, but the number of species generated decreases as
compared to the hermaphroditic case. Evolution results in fewer species having
more abundant populations.

  Properties from Mobile-Phone Data","10 pages",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile phones are quickly becoming the primary source for social, behavioral,
and environmental sensing and data collection. Today's smartphones are equipped
with increasingly more sensors and accessible data types that enable the
collection of literally dozens of signals related to the phone, its user, and
its environment. A great deal of research effort in academia and industry is
put into mining this raw data for higher level sense-making, such as
understanding user context, inferring social networks, learning individual
features, predicting outcomes, and so on. In this work we investigate the
properties of learning and inference of real world data collected via mobile
phones over time. In particular, we look at the dynamic learning process over
time, and how the ability to predict individual parameters and social links is
incrementally enhanced with the accumulation of additional data. To do this, we
use the Friends and Family dataset, which contains rich data signals gathered
from the smartphones of 140 adult members of a young-family residential
community for over a year, and is one of the most comprehensive mobile phone
datasets gathered in academia to date. We develop several models that predict
social and individual properties from sensed mobile phone data, including
detection of life-partners, ethnicity, and whether a person is a student or
not. Then, for this set of diverse learning tasks, we investigate how the
prediction accuracy evolves over time, as new data is collected. Finally, based
on gained insights, we propose a method for advance prediction of the maximal
learning accuracy possible for the learning task at hand, based on an initial
set of measurements. This has practical implications, like informing the design
of mobile data collection campaigns, or evaluating analysis strategies.

the constraint matrix A is random, i.e., its entries are i.i.d. Gaussian or,
more generally, its rows are i.i.d. from a spherically symmetric distribution.
The radius of the largest inscribed ball is closely related to the existence of
integer points in the polytope. We show that for m=2^O(sqrt{n}), there exist
constants c_0 < c_1 such that with high probability, random polytopes are
integer feasible if the radius of the largest ball contained in the polytope is
at least c_1sqrt{log(m/n)}; and integer infeasible if the largest ball
contained in the polytope is centered at (1/2,...,1/2) and has radius at most
c_0sqrt{log(m/n)}. Thus, random polytopes transition from having no integer
points to being integer feasible within a constant factor increase in the
radius of the largest inscribed ball. We show integer feasibility via a
randomized polynomial-time algorithm for finding an integer point in the
polytope.
  Our main tool is a simple new connection between integer feasibility and
linear discrepancy. We extend a recent algorithm for finding low-discrepancy

the radius lower bound that guarantees integer feasibility of random polytopes.

class of random matrices including independent unitary invariant matrices. This
notion is extended for independent random matrices invariant in law by
conjugation by permutation matrices. This fact leads naturally to an extension
of free probability, formalized under the notions of traffic probability. We
first establish this construction for random matrices. We define the traffic
distribution of random matrices, which is richer than the *-distribution of
free probability. The knowledge of the individual traffic distributions of
independent permutation invariant families of matrices is sufficient to compute
the limiting distribution of the join family. Under a factorization assumption,
we call traffic independence the asymptotic rule that plays the role of
independence with respect to traffic distributions. Wigner matrices, Haar
unitary matrices and uniform permutation matrices converge in traffic
distributions, a fact which yields new results on the limiting *-distributions
of several matrices we can construct from them. Then we define the abstract
traffic spaces as non commutative probability spaces with more structure. We
prove that at an algebraic level, traffic independence in some sense unifies
the three canonical notions of tensor, free and Boolean independence. A central
limiting theorem is stated in this context, interpolating between the tensor,
free and Boolean central limit theorems.

non-existence result is expected. Concerning the dynamics we show for initial

While it remains very challenging to calculate the imaginary parts of these

significant role in extracting the angle gamma in the b-d unitarity triangle of
the CKM matrix. The real part on its own gives a lower bound to the absolute
magnitude of the amplitude which is in itself an important constraint for
determining gamma. Also the relevant phase can be obtained by using B-decays in
conjunction with relevant charm decay data. Direct four-point function
calculations on the lattice, while computationally demanding, does yield the
real part as that is not impeded by the Maiani-Testa theorem. As an
approximation, we argue that the chiral expansion of these decays is valid in a
framework similar to that of hard-pion chiral perturbation theory. In addition
to constructing the leading-order operators, we also discuss the features of
the next-to-leading order chiral expansion. These include the contributions

known SiC spectral feature at ~11 microns and a reduction in the continuum at
13 microns. As expected, our diffraction limited spatial information shows an
extended circumstellar envelope. We also demonstrate that the dusty envelope
appears to be ~30% larger at the wavelengths of the SiC feature, likely due to
the increased opacity of SiC. The deconvolved FWHM of the object increases from
0.43"" (~56 AU) for wavelength < 10 microns to 0.58"" (~75 AU) at 11.8 microns,

perturbations of this energy density are intrinsically nonadiabatic and source
relative entropy perturbations. The resulting baryonic matter power spectrum is
shown to be compatible with the 2dFGRS and SDSS (DR7) data. A joint statistical
analysis, using also Hubble-function and supernovae Ia data, shows that,
different from other studies, there exists a maximum in the probability
distribution for a negative present value of the deceleration parameter.
Moreover, the unified model presented here favors a matter content that is of
the order of the baryonic matter abundance suggested by big-bang
nucleosynthesis. A problem of simple bulk viscous models, however, is the
behavior of the gravitational potential and the reproduction of the CMB power
spectrum.

curvature bound and show that they are connected to rate of convergence to
tangent cones. In fact, we show that the derivative of each of these three
monotone quantities is bounded from below in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff
distance to the nearest cone. The monotonicity formulas are related to the
classical Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem and Perelman's celebrated
monotonicity formula for the Ricci flow. We will explain the connection between
all of these. Moreover, we show that these new monotonicity formulas are linked
to a new sharp gradient estimate for the Green's function that we prove. This
is parallel to that Perelman's monotonicity is closely related to the sharp
gradient estimate for the heat kernel of Li-Yau. In [CM4] we will use the
monotonicity formulas we prove here to show uniqueness of certain tangent cones
of Einstein manifolds and in [CM3] we will prove a number of related

ground state, which gives rise to a non- Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point due to
the competition between the Kondo-Yosida singlet and CEF singlet states. On the
basis of the numerical renormalization group method, we find that the magnetic
field breaks this NFL fixed point via two mechanisms: one causing the
polarization of f-electrons and the other giving the ""channel"" anisotropy.
These two mechanisms induce a difference in the magnetic field dependence of
the characteristic temperature T_F^{*}(H), the crossover temperature from NFL
to Fermi-liquid behavior. While the polarization of f-electrons gives
T_F^{*}(H) \propto H^x (x\sim2.0), the ""channel"" anisotropy gives the
H-independent T_F^{*}(H). These two mechanisms cross over continuously at
approximately the crossover magnetic field H_c, where an anomalous H-dependence
of T_F^{*}(H) appears. Such T_F^{*}(H) well reproduces the NFL behaviors
observed in Th_{1-x}U_xRu_2Si_2. We also find that the H-dependence of the
resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility are in good agreement with the
experimental results of this material. These results suggest that the NFL
behaviors observed in Th_{1-x}U_xRu_2Si_2 can be understood if this material is

number of research work. However, L\'{e}vy mobility known to closely capture
human movement patterns has not been adopted in such work. Understanding the
delay-capacity tradeoff for a network with L\'{e}vy mobility can provide
important insights into understanding the performance of real mobile networks
governed by human mobility. This paper analytically derives an important point
in the delay-capacity tradeoff for L\'{e}vy mobility, known as the critical
delay. The critical delay is the minimum delay required to achieve greater
throughput than what conventional static networks can possibly achieve (i.e.,
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$ per node in a network with $n$ nodes). The L\'{e}vy mobility
includes L\'{e}vy flight and L\'{e}vy walk whose step size distributions
parametrized by $\alpha \in (0,2]$ are both heavy-tailed while their times
taken for the same step size are different. Our proposed technique involves (i)
analyzing the joint spatio-temporal probability density function of a
time-varying location of a node for L\'{e}vy flight and (ii) characterizing an
embedded Markov process in L\'{e}vy walk which is a semi-Markov process. The
results indicate that in L\'{e}vy walk, there is a phase transition such that
for $\alpha \in (0,1)$, the critical delay is always $\Theta (n^{1/2})$ and for
$\alpha \in [1,2]$ it is $\Theta(n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}})$. In contrast, L\'{e}vy
flight has the critical delay $\Theta(n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}})$ for
$\alpha\in(0,2]$.

is to gather an understanding of the system's architecture. Therefore, a common
approach is to use parsers to translate the source code into a model conforming
to the abstract syntax of the programming language the system is implemented in

used to generate more abstract views on the system's architecture. This
transformation case deals with the creation of a state machine model out of a

sorption and desorption from nanoporous solids, which attributes hysteresis to
hindered molecular condensation with attractive lateral interactions. The
classical mean-field theory of van der Waals is applied to predict the
dependence of hysteresis on temperature and pore size, using the regular
solution model and gradient energy of Cahn and Hilliard. A simple ""hierarchical
wetting"" model for thin nanopores is developed to describe the case of strong
wetting by the first monolayer, followed by condensation of nanodroplets and
nanobubbles in the bulk. The model predicts a larger hysteresis critical
temperature and enhanced hysteresis for molecular condensation across nanopores
at high vapor pressure than within monolayers at low vapor pressure. For
heterogeneous pores, the theory predicts sorption/desorption sequences similar
to those seen in molecular dynamics simulations, where the interfacial energy
(or gradient penalty) at nanopore junctions acts as a free energy barrier for
snap-through instabilities. The model helps to quantitatively understand recent
experimental data for concrete or cement paste wetting and drying cycles and
suggests new experiments at different temperatures and humidity sweep rates.

specific heat [Cp (T)] was investigated in temperature range 1.9-250 K, under
magnetic field of up to 70 kOe. Unfortunately though no magnetic and
superconducting transitions are observed in specific heat, a Schottky type
anomaly is observed at low temperatures below 20 K. This low temperature
Schottky type anomaly can be attributed to splitting of the ground state
spectroscopic term 8S7/2 of paramagnetic Gd3+ ions by both internal and
external magnetic fields. It was also observed that Cp (T) being measured for
different values of magnetic field, possesses the same crossing point (T* = 2.7
K), up to the applied magnetic field 70 kOe. A quantitative explanation of this
phenomenon, based on its shape and temperature dependence of the associated
generalized heat capacity (Cp), is presented. This effect supports the crossing
point phenomena, which is supposed to be inherent for strongly correlated
systems.

graphs. Given a graph $G$ and a root node $r$, we seek a single spanning tree
$T$ of minimum {\em stretch}, where the stretch of $T$ is defined to be the
maximum ratio, over all terminal sets $X$, of the cost of the minimal sub-tree
$T_X$ of $T$ that connects $X$ to $r$ to the cost of an optimal Steiner tree
connecting $X$ to $r$ in $G$. Universal Steiner trees (USTs) are important for
data aggregation problems where computing the Steiner tree from scratch for
every input instance of terminals is costly, as for example in low energy
sensor network applications.
  We provide a polynomial time \ust\ construction for general graphs with
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$-stretch. We also give a polynomial time
$\polylog(n)$-stretch construction for minor-free graphs. One basic building
block of our algorithms is a hierarchy of graph partitions, each of which
guarantees small strong diameter for each cluster and bounded neighbourhood
intersections for each node. We show close connections between the problems of
constructing USTs and building such graph partitions. Our construction of
partition hierarchies for general graphs is based on an iterative cluster
merging procedure, while the one for minor-free graphs is based on a separator
theorem for such graphs and the solution to a cluster aggregation problem that
may be of independent interest even for general graphs. To our knowledge, this
is the first subpolynomial-stretch ($o(n^\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon > 0$) UST
construction for general graphs, and the first polylogarithmic-stretch UST
construction for minor-free graphs.

routing (flow) for multiple-unicast traffic (multiple sources communicating

within a logarithmic factor of the number of sources of the max flow. In this
paper we ""extend"" the wireline result to the wireless context.
  Our main result is the approximate optimality of a simple layering principle:
{\em local physical-layer schemes combined with global routing}. We use the
{\em reciprocity} of the wireless channel critically in this result. Our formal
result is in the context of channel models for which ""good"" local schemes, that
achieve the cut-set bound, exist (such as Gaussian MAC and broadcast channels,
broadcast erasure networks, fast fading Gaussian networks).
  Layered architectures, common in the engineering-design of wireless networks,
can have near-optimal performance if the {\em locality} over which
physical-layer schemes should operate is carefully designed. Feedback is shown
to play a critical role in enabling the separation between the physical and the

anti-neutrino. KATRIN investigates spectroscopically the electron spectrum from
tritium beta- decay close to the kinematic endpoint of 18.6 keV with a high
resolution electro-static filter of unprecedented energy resolution of 0.93 eV.
KATRIN will be built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe on site of the KIT
Campus North. For such a precise mass-determination a key parameter is the
stability of the source in terms of beta-activity und isotopic purity. For that
purpose KATRIN uses a strong windowless gaseous tritium source of almost pure
molecular tritium (95%) with a throughput of 40 g tritium per day stabilized on
0.1% level. The decay electrons are guided adiabatically from the source to the
spectrometer by means of superconducting magnets while at the same time the
tritium flow rate to the spectrometers has to be reduced by a factor > 1E14. To
reach the sensitivity KATRIN is aiming for, an high energy resolution as well
as high statistics and low background are needed. A tandem spectrometer system
is used for energy analysis. The transport section consists of a differential
pumping system (DPS2-F) and a cryogenic pumping section (CPS). In the DPS2-F
the tritium flow will be reduced by differential pumping while in the CPS
tritium will be adsorbed on a pre-condensed argon layer prepared inside
KATRIN's beamtube. To assure the required stability of the source on 0.1% level
a stabilized tritium injection in the source is required. This is done by
closed tritium loops. The purity and composition of the injected gas will be
monitored by Laser Raman spectroscopy.

and its motion, is responsible for various important phenomena, ranging from
atomic fine structure to topological condensed matter physics. The recent
experimental breakthrough on the realization of SOC for ultra-cold atoms
provides a completely new platform for exploring spin-orbit coupled superfluid
physics. However, the SOC strength in the experiment, determined by the applied
laser wavelengths, is not tunable. In this Letter, we propose a scheme for
tuning the SOC strength through a fast and coherent modulation of the laser
intensities. We show that the many-body interaction between atoms, together
with the tunable SOC, can drive a \textit{quantum phase transition} (QPT) from
spin-balanced to spin-polarized ground states in a harmonic trapped
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). This transition realizes the long-sought QPT in
the quantum Dicke model, and may have important applications in quantum optics
and quantum information. We characterize the QPT using the periods of
collective oscillations (center of mass motion and scissors mode) of the BEC,
which show pronounced peaks and damping around the quantum critical point.

landscape with experimentally determined nucleosome binding preferences. We
show that DNA regions with enhanced nonspecific TF-DNA binding are
statistically significantly depleted of nucleosomes. We suggest therefore that
the competition between TFs with histones for nonspecific binding to genomic
sequences might be an important mechanism influencing nucleosome-binding
preferences in vivo. We also predict that poly(dA:dT) and poly(dC:dG) tracts
represent genomic elements with the strongest propensity for nonspecific TF-DNA
binding, thus allowing TFs to outcompete nucleosomes at these elements. Our
results suggest that nonspecific TF-DNA binding might provide a barrier for
statistical positioning of nucleosomes throughout the yeast genome. We predict
that the strength of this barrier increases with the concentration of DNA
binding proteins in a cell. We discuss the connection of the proposed mechanism

support to the wave function ansatz proposed by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer
(BCS). Indeed, this ansatz --- with all pairs condensed into the same state ---
corresponds to the ground state of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian. Yet, this
Hamiltonian only is part of the BCS Hamiltonian. As a result, the BCS ansatz
definitely differs from the BCS Hamiltonian ground state. This can be directly
shown either through a perturbative approach starting from the Bogoliubov
Hamiltonian, or better by analytically solving the BCS Schr\""{o}dinger equation
along Richardson-Gaudin exact procedure. Still, the BCS ansatz leads not only
to the correct extensive part of the ground state energy for an arbitrary
number of pairs in the energy layer where the potential acts --- as recently
obtained by solving Richardson-Gaudin equations analytically --- but also to a
few other physical quantities such as the electron distribution, as here shown.
The present work also considers arbitrary filling of the potential layer and
evidences the existence of a super dilute and a super dense regime of pairs,
with a gap \emph{different} from the usual gap. These regimes constitute the
lower and upper limits of density-induced BEC-BCS cross-over in Cooper pair
systems.

to the almost periodic 11 year smooth component, and the analysis does not give
the correct $H$ for the stochastic component. Better estimates are obtained by
detrended fluctuations analysis (DFA), but estimates are biased and errors are
large due to the short time records. These time series can be modeled as a
stochastic process of the form $x(t)=y(t)+\sigma \sqrt{y(t)}\, w_H(t)$, where
$y(t)$ is the smooth component, and $w_H(t) $ is a stationary fractional noise
with Hurst exponent $H$. From ensembles of numerical solutions to the
stochastic model, and application of Bayes' theorem, we can obtain bias and
error bars on $H$ and also a test of the hypothesis that a process is
uncorrelated ($H=1/2$). The conclusions from the present data sets are that
SSN, TSI and TSI reconstruction almost certainly are long-range persistent, but
with most probable value $H\approx 0.7$. The SFI process, however, is either

consists of a spin chain with two impurities a distance $d$ apart. We find that
at low energy (frequency) the impurities flow to strong coupling, thereby
effectively cutting the chain into three parts, with the middle island
containing a discrete number of spin excitations. At finite frequency spin
transport through the system increases. We find a strong dependence of the

Studies have shown that Small World properties, primarily low average path

small world properties remains highly challenging. Studies also show that,
wireless ad hoc networks with small world properties show a degree distribution

wireless ad hoc network with non-uniform node density with only local

clustering coefficient. To achieve our goal, our algorithm first identifies
logical regions using Lateral Inhibition technique, then identifies the nodes
that beamform and finally the beam properties using Flocking. We use Lateral
Inhibition and Flocking because they enable us to use local state information
as opposed to other techniques. We support our work with simulation results and
analysis, which show that a reduction of up to 40% can be achieved for a
high-density network. We also show the effect of hopcount used to create

consists of simulating a water nanodroplet on a flat graphitic surface,
measuring the equilibrium contact angle, extrapolating it to the limit of a
macroscopic droplet and finally matching this quantity to experimental results.
Considering recent evidence demonstrating that the contact angle of water on a
graphitic plane is much higher than what was previously reported, we estimate
the oxygen-carbon interaction for the recent SPC/Fwwater model. Results
indicate a value of about 0.2 kJ/mol, much lower than previous estimations. We
then perform simulations of cylindrical water filaments on graphitic surfaces,
in order to compare and correlate contact angles resulting from these two

describe the relation between contact angle and drop size in the case of
extremely small systems and that contributions different from the one deriving

a distributed algorithm that reaches the consensus in a fast way. The algorithm
is expressed in the form of a linear iteration and, at each step, the agents
only require to transmit their current state to their neighbors. The difference
with respect to previous approaches is that the update rule used by the network
is based on the second order difference equation that describes the Chebyshev
polynomials of first kind. As a consequence, we show that our algorithm
achieves the consensus using far less iterations than other approaches. We
characterize the main properties of the algorithm for both, fixed and switching
communication topologies. The main contribution of the paper is the study of
the properties of the Chebyshev polynomials in distributed consensus
applications, proposing an algorithm that increases the convergence rate with
respect to existing approaches. Theoretical results, as well as experiments
with synthetic data, show the benefits using our algorithm.

produced by opening cracks, which can be considered as precursors of general
fracture. An important feature, observed on both laboratory and geophysical
scale, is that the MHz radiation systematically precedes the kHz one. Yet, the
link between an individual EM precursor and a distinctive stage of the EQ
preparation comprises a crucial open question. A recently proposed two-stage
model on preseismic EM activity suggests that the MHz EM emission is due to the
fracture of the highly heterogeneous system that surrounds the fault. The
finally emerged kHz EM emission is rooted in the final stage of EQ generation,
namely, the fracture of entities sustaining the system. In this work we try to
further penetrate and elucidate the link of the precursory kHz EM activity with
the last stage of EQ generation building on two theoretical models for EQ
dynamics. Firstly, the self-affine model states that an EQ is due to the
slipping of two rough and rigid fractional Brownian profiles, one over the
other, when there is an intersection between them. Secondly, the
fragment-asperity model, rooted in a nonextensive Tsallis framework starting
from first principles, consists of two rough profiles interacting via fragments
filling the gap. In the latter approach, the mechanism of triggering EQ is
established through the interaction of the irregularities of the fault planes
and the fragments between them. This paper shows that these models of EQ
dynamics can be linked with the detected kHz EM emission. In this framework of
analysis of preseismic EM activity, we identify sufficient criteria that offer
the possibility to discriminate whether a seismic shock is sourced in the
fracture of fragments filling the gap between the rough profiles or in the
fracture of ""teeth"" distributed across the fractional Brownian profiles that
sustain the system.

vision systems. Every camera in the network has limited communication
capabilities and can only exchange local matches with its neighbors. We propose
a distributed algorithm that takes these local matches and computes global
correspondences by a proper propagation in the network. When the algorithm
finishes, each camera knows the global correspondences between its features and
the features of all the cameras in the network. The presence of spurious
introduced by the local matcher may produce inconsistent global
correspondences, which are association paths between features from the same
camera. The contributions of this work are the propagation of the local matches
and the detection and resolution of these inconsistencies by deleting local
matches. Our resolution algorithm considers the quality of each local match,
when this information is provided by the local matcher. We formally prove that
after executing the algorithm, the network finishes with a global data
association free of inconsistencies. We provide a fully decentralized solution
to the problem which does not rely on any particular communication topology.

moderate to high resolution. The column density ratios among C II, O I, Si II,
and Fe II are nearly identical to sub-DLAs and metal-poor ([M/H] < -1) DLAs at
lower redshifts, with no significant evolution over 2 < z < 6. The estimated
intrinsic scatter in the ratio of any two elements is also small, with a
typical r.m.s. deviation of <0.1 dex. These facts suggest that dust depletion
and ionization effects are minimal in our z > 4.7 systems, as in the
lower-redshift DLAs, and that the column density ratios are close to the
intrinsic relative element abundances. The abundances in our z > 4.7 systems
are therefore likely to represent the typical integrated yields from stellar
populations within the first gigayear of cosmic history. Due to the time limit
imposed by the age of the universe at these redshifts, our measurements thus
place direct constraints on the metal production of massive stars, including
iron yields of prompt supernovae. The lack of redshift evolution further
suggests that the metal inventories of most metal-poor absorption systems at z
> 2 are also dominated by massive stars, with minimal contributions from
delayed Type Ia supernovae or AGB winds. The relative abundances in our systems
broadly agree with those in very metal-poor, non-carbon-enhanced Galactic halo
stars. This is consistent with the picture in which present-day metal-poor
stars were potentially formed as early as one billion years after the Big Bang.

away from the surface of the Sun, their radiative output is affected via the
Doppler dimming or brightening effects. Aims. In this paper we ask whether
observational signatures of the changes in the radiative output of eruptive
prominences can be found in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) observations of the first
resonance line of ionised helium at 304 {\AA}. We also investigate whether
these observations can be used to perform a diagnostic of the plasma of the
eruptive prominence. Methods. We first look for suitable events in the SDO/AIA
database. The variation of intensity of arbitrarily selected features in the
304 channel is studied as a function of velocity in the plane of the sky. These
results are then compared with new non-LTE radiative transfer calculations of
the intensity of the He II 304 resonance line. Results. We find that
observations of intensities in various parts of the four eruptive prominences
studied here are sometimes consistent with the Doppler dimming effect on the He
II 304 {\AA} line. However, in some cases, one observes an increase in
intensity in the 304 channel with velocity, in contradiction to what is
expected from the Doppler dimming effect alone. The use of the non-LTE models
allows us to explain the different behaviour of the intensity by changes in the
plasma parameters inside the prominence, in particular the column mass of the
plasma and its temperature. Conclusions. The non-LTE models used here are more
realistic than what was used in previous calculations. They are able to
reproduce qualitatively the range of observations from SDO/AIA analysed in this
study. Thanks to non-LTE modelling, we can infer the plasma parameters in
eruptive prominences from SDO/AIA observations at 304 {\AA}.

to scattering, and it has shown a core-jet morphology with weak extended
emission rotating with wavelength. The proximity of M\,81 (D=3.63 Mpc) allows a
detailed investigation of its nucleus to be made. The nucleus is four orders of
magnitude more luminous than the Galactic centre, and is therefore considered a
link between SgrA* and the more powerful nuclei of radio galaxies and quasars.
Our main goal was to determine the size of M81* at a shorter wavelength thus
directly testing whether the frequency-size dependent law Theta propto
nu^(-0.8) was still valid for wavelengths shorter than 1cm. In addition, we
also aimed to confirm the rotation of the source as a function of frequency. We
observed the continuum 7mm radio emission of M81* using the Very Long Baseline
Array on Sep 13, 2002, using nearby calibrators to apply their interferometric
observables to the target source, to increase the chances of detection. The
source was detected on all baselines and hybrid mapping was possible. We
present the first 7mm VLBI image of the core of M81*, which represents the
highest resolution image ever of this source. Modeling the interferometric
visibilities with two Gaussian functions sets constraints on the angular size
of its core down to 38 microarcseconds, corresponding to a maximum (projected)
linear size of 138AU, and shows extended emission towards the NE with a
position angle of ~50deg. A fit of one Gaussian elliptical function yields a
position angle of 28+/-8 degrees for its elongated, compact structure.
Combining the 7mm size with earlier measurements at other frequencies we
determine a frequency-size dependence of Theta propto nu^(-0.88+/-0.04).

motion. We first adopt a microscopic model for harmonically oscillating
particles at finite temperature T moving non-relativistically with constant
velocity. We use a statistical-mechanical description where time-dependent
correlations are involved. This description is physical and direct, and, in
spite of its simplicity, is able to elucidate the essentials of the problem.
This treatment elaborates upon, and extends, an earlier theory of ours back in
1992. The energy change Delta E turns out to be finite in general,
corresponding to a finite friction force. In the limit of zero temperature the
formalism yields, however, Delta E ->0, this being due to our assumption about
constant velocity, meaning slowly varying coupling. For couplings varying more
rapidly, there will also be a finite friction force at T=0. As second part of
our work, we consider the friction problem using time-dependent perturbation
theory. The dissipation, basically a second order effect, is obtainable with
the use of first order theory, the reason being the absence of cross terms due
to uncorrelated phases of eigenstates. The third part of the present paper is
to demonstrate explicitly the equivalence of our results with those recently
obtained by Barton (2010); this being not a trivial task since the formal
results are seemingly quite different from each other.

combines the vacuum polarization energy of fermion zero-point fluctuations and
the binding energy of occupied energy levels, which are of the same order in a
semi-classical expansion. Populating these bound states assigns a charge to the
string. Strings carrying fermion charge become stable if the Higgs and gauge
fields are coupled to a fermion that is less than twice as heavy as the top
quark. The vacuum remains stable in the model, because neutral strings are not
energetically favored. These findings suggest that extraordinarily large

where the expressions take into account the values of $\rho_{s

the galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. We apply the method to
simulated data sets obtained under various astrophysical conditions, and show
how the input model parameters can be estimated through our analysis,
introducing the notion of ""clustering similarity"" (between data sets), to which
we give a precise statistical meaning. We also study how the constraining power
of the method is influenced by the size of the data set under investigation,
the minimum energy of the UHECRs to which it is applied, and a prior assumption
about the underlying source distribution. We also show that this method is
particularly adapted to data sets consisting of a few tens to a few hundreds of

GeV of the supernova remnant (SNR) W44, one of the most interesting systems for
studying cosmic-ray production. W44 is an intermediate-age SNR (20, 000 years)
and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell,
nearby molecular clouds, and bright [SII] emitting regions. We extend our
gamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurements
which could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. We find
that gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape of
the inner SNR shocked plasma. Furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows a
prominent peak near 1 GeV with a clear decrement at energies below a few
hundreds of MeV as expected from neutral pion decay. Here we demonstrate that:
(1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all W44 multiwavelength
constraints derived from radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2)
ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously the
well-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellar
density much larger than the value derived from observations; (3) the hadron
energy spectrum is well described by a power-law (with index s = 3.0 \pm 0.1)
and a low-energy cut-off at Ec = 6 \pm 1 GeV. Direct evidence for pion emission
is then established in an SNR for the first time.

framework. Here we complete the standard description of the strain-induced
vector potential, which accounts only for the hopping perturbation, with the
explicit inclusion of the lattice deformations or, equivalently, the
deformation of the Brillouin zone. These corrections are linear in strain and
are different at each of the strained, inequivalent Dirac points, and hence are

This effect can be relevant in scenarios of inhomogeneous strain profiles,
where electronic motion depends on the amount of overlap among the local Fermi

induced by inhomogeneous strain configurations, and can lead to new
opportunities in tailoring the optimal strain fields for certain desired

shows spectral evidence of three such self-absorbed components. The analysis
yields an estimate of the power that is required to eject the plasmoids from
the central engine that is independent of other estimates that exist in the
literature for different flares. The technique has an advantage since the
absorbed spectrum contains an independent constraint provided by the optical
depth at each epoch of observation. The modeling procedure presented here
self-consistently determines the dimensions of the radio emitting plasma from
the spectral shape. Thus, structural dimensions are determined analytically
that can be much smaller than interferometer beam-widths. A synthesis of the
time evolution of the components allows one to address the fundamental
uncertainties in previous estimates. First, the plasma is not protonic, but it
is comprised of an electron-positron gas. The minimum electron energy is
determined to be less than six times the electron rest mass energy. The
analysis also indicates that the plasmoids are ejected from the central engine
magnetically dominated. The temporal behavior is one of magnetic energy
conversion to mechanical energy as the plasmoids approach equipartition. The
time dependent models bound the impulsive energy flux, $Q$, required to eject
the individual major flare plasmoids from the central engine to, $4.1 \times

as alternative to the dark matter paradigm. In the present paper we consider
four benchmark measurements: the universality of the central surface density of
galaxy dark matter haloes, the cored dark matter haloes in dwarf spheroidal
galaxies, the non-existence of dark disks in spiral galaxies and distribution
of dark matter after collision of clusters of galaxies (the Bullet cluster is a
famous example). Only some of these phenomena (but not all of them) can (in
principle) be explained by the dark matter and the theories of modified
gravity. However, we argue that the framework of the gravitational polarization
of the quantum vacuum allows the understanding of the totality of these
phenomena.

of the classical and preconditioned Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) schemes are
analyzed. For the classical HLL scheme, the accuracy problem is attributable to
the extremely large coefficient of the velocity-derivative term of the momentum
equation. For the preconditioned HLL scheme, the global cut-off problem is
attributable to the denominator of the coefficients, whereas the particular
pressure gradient sensor problem results from the loss of the capability to
suppress the checkerboard pressure-velocity decoupling. A new all-speed HLL
scheme, which can overcome these problems by only multiplying the
momentum-derivative term in the momentum equation by a function related to the
local Mach number, is proposed. More importantly, the present study shows the
generality of the three rules, which can be powerful tools for analyzing and
proposing schemes. The second rule involving the checkerboard problem is also
improved by emphasizing that the coefficients of pressure-derivative term in
the continuity and energy equations should be changed simultaneously.

and interface traps at the Si-SiO2 interface will build up. As function of the
12 keV X-ray dose the microscopic defects in test structures and the macro-
scopic electrical properties of segmented sensors have been investigated. From
the test structures the oxide charge density, the density of interface traps

sensors surface damage introduced by the X-rays increases the full depletion

addition an electron accumulation layer forms at the Si-SiO2 interface which
increases with dose and decreases with applied voltage. Using TCAD simulations

M{\pi}{\pi} < 2.5 GeV has been studied with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an
integrated luminosity of 82 pb-1. The analysis was carried out in the kinematic
range of 2 < Q2 < 80 GeV2, 32 < W < 180 GeV and |t| < 0.6 GeV2, where Q2 is the
photon virtuality, W is the photon-proton centre-of-mass energy and t is the
squared four-momentum transfer at the proton vertex. The two-pion
invariant-mass distribution is interpreted in terms of the pion electromagnetic
form factor, |F(M{\pi}{\pi})|, assuming that the studied mass range includes
the contributions of the {\rho}, {\rho}' and {\rho}"" vector-meson states. The
masses and widths of the resonances were obtained and the Q2 dependence of the
cross-section ratios {\sigma}({\rho}' \rightarrow {\pi}{\pi})/{\sigma}({\rho})
and {\sigma}({\rho}"" \rightarrow {\pi}{\pi})/{\sigma}({\rho}) was extracted.
The pion form factor obtained in the present analysis is compared to that
obtained in e+e- \rightarrow {\pi}+{\pi}-.

independent, properties, consistent with random matrix theory. The quantum
transport can also be rooted, via the semiclassical approximation, in sums over
the classical scattering trajectories. Correlations between such trajectories
can be organized diagrammatically and have been shown to yield universal
answers for some observables. Here, we develop the general combinatorial
treatment of the semiclassical diagrams, through a connection to factorizations
of permutations. We show agreement between the semiclassical and random matrix
approaches to the moments of the transmission eigenvalues. The result is valid
for all moments to all orders of the expansion in inverse channel number for
all three main symmetry classes (with and without time reversal symmetry and
spin-orbit interaction) and extends to nonlinear statistics. This finally
explains the applicability of random matrix theory to chaotic quantum transport
in terms of the underlying dynamics as well as providing semiclassical access
to the probability density of the transmission eigenvalues.

the transition from static to dynamic friction is essentially a spatially and
temporally non-uniform process, initiated by a rupture-like detachment front.
We show the suitability of the Frenkel-Kontorova model for describing this
transition. The model predicts the existence of two types of detachment fronts,
explaining both the variability and abrupt change of velocity observed in
experiments. The quantitative relation obtained between the velocity of the
detachment front and the ratio of shear to normal stress is consistent with
experiments. The model provides a functional dependence between slip velocity
and shear stress, and predicts that slip velocity is independent of normal
stress. Paradoxically, the transition from static to dynamic friction does not
depend explicitly on ether the static or the dynamic friction coefficient,
although the beginning and end of transition process are controlled by these
coefficients.

evolution of the solar irradiance is fundamental to forecast the evolution of
the neutral and ionized components of the Earth's atmosphere.We developed an
artificial neural network model to compute the evolution of the solar
irradiance in near-real time. The model is based on the assumption that that
great part of the solar irradiance variability is due to the evolution of the
structure of the solar magnetic field. We employ a Layer-Recurrent Network
(LRN) to model the complex relationships between the evolution of the bipolar
magnetic structures (input) and the solar irradiance (output). The evolution of
the bipolar magnetic structures is obtained from near-real time solar disk
magnetograms and intensity images. The magnetic structures are identify and
classified according to the area of the solar disk covered. We constrained the
model by comparing the output of the model and observations of the solar
irradiance made by instruments onboard of SORCE spacecraft. Here we focus on
two regions of the spectra that are covered by SORCE instruments. The
generalization of the network is tested by dividing the data sets on two
groups: the training set; and, the validation set. We have found that the model
error is wavelength dependent. While the model error for 24-hour forecast in
the band from 115 to 180 nm is lower than 5%, the model error can reach 20% in
the band from 180 to 310 nm. The performance of the network reduces
progressively with the increase of the forecast period, which limits
significantly the maximum forecast period that we can achieve with the
discussed architecture. The model proposed allows us to predict the total and
spectral solar irradiance up to three days in advance.

  superseded by gr-qc > arXiv:1302.6506, of more comprehensive scope",,,,"physics.gen-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental laws of physics are required to be invariant under local
spatial scale change. In 3-dimensional space, this leads to a variation in
Planck constant \hbar and speed of light c. They vary as \hbar ~ a^(1/2) and c
~ a^(-1/2), a is the local scale. A direct consequence is that the expanding
universe progressively alters the values of c which in turn affects the
evolution of the universe itself. Friedmann eqns violate scale invariance and
neglect to account for the scale dependency of c. We build a cosmological model
which is fully consistent with scale invariance and respects Lorentz
invariance. This model leads to a universe different from the ones depicted in
Friedmann model. We apply our model to resolve a series of observational and
theoretical difficulties in modern cosmology: ""runaway density parameter""
problem, budgetary shortfall, horizon problem, eg. Our model does not resort to
inflation hypothesis. We derive a modification to the Hubble law and Hubble
constant, and a new brightness-redshift relationship for Type Ia supernovae:
(a) Hubble constant has been inadvertently overestimated by a factor of 9/5; so
has the critical density by (9/5)^2; (b) Our new photometric distance-redshift
relationship d_L=2c/(3H0)*(1+z)^(5/6)\ln(1+z) with one parameter H0=37 fits to
the high-$z$ objects as equally well as the traditional relationship does with
three parameters H0=70.5, OmegaM=0.27, OmegaL=0.73. We draw two conclusions:
(i) With H0=37, the critical density is only 0.28 time the value previously
thought; dark energy is absent. (ii) H0=37 restores the age estimate to 17.6 Gy
(via t_0=2/(3H0)). They also raise the possibility that the universe expansion
is not accelerating, but rather a result of c progressively adapting to new
spatial scale as the universe expands. Finally, we discuss an array of
implications of scale invariance in the larger context of physics.
