orbital degeneracy of the bulk band structure and leads to a 2DEG composed of

presented. In the limit of usual continuous spaces, the algebra of constraints
reproduces that of general relativity in Hamilton formalism. While the momentum
constraints can be realized rather easily by the symmetry of the tensor models,
the form of the Hamiltonian constraints is strongly limited by the condition of
the closure of the whole constraint algebra. Thus the Hamiltonian constraints
have been determined on the assumption that they are local and at most cubic in
canonical variables. The form of the Hamiltonian constraints has similarity
with the Hamiltonian in the c < 1 string field theory, but it seems impossible
to realize such a constraint algebras in the framework of vector or matrix

processes: tidal torques, radiative perturbations (BYORP), close planetary

thought to lead to a signal dominated by UV emission. If, however, the black
hole spins rapidly and the poloidal magnetic field intensity on the black hole
horizon is comparable to the inner accretion disk pressure, a powerful jet may
form whose luminosity can easily exceed the thermal UV luminosity. When the jet
beam points at Earth, its non-thermal luminosity can dominate the emitted
spectrum. The thermal and non-thermal components decay differently with time.
In particular, the thermal emission should remain roughly constant for a
significant time after the period of maximum accretion, beginning to diminish
only after a delay, whereas after the peak accretion rate, the non-thermal jet
emission decays, but then reaches a plateau. Both transitions are tied to a
characteristic timescale $t_{\rm Edd}$ at which the accretion rate falls below
Eddington. Making use of this timescale in a new parameter-inference formalism
for tidal disruption events with significant emission from a jet, we analyze
the recent flare source Swift J2058. It is consistent with an event in which a
main sequence solar-type staris disrupted by a black hole of mass $\sim 4
\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$. The beginning of the flat phase in the non-thermal
emission from this source can possibly be seen in the late-time lightcurve.
Optical photometry over the first $\simeq 40$ d of this flare is also
consistent with this picture, but is only weakly constraining because the
bolometric correction is very uncertain. We suggest that future searches for
main sequence tidal disruptions use methods sensitive to jet radiation as well
as to thermal UV radiation.

escape of N2 from Pluto's atmosphere for two solar heating conditions: no
heating above 1450 km and solar minimum heating conditions. In the combined
model, one-dimensional fluid equations are applied for the dense part of the
atmosphere, while the exobase region is described by a kinetic model and
calculated by the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Fluid and kinetic parts
of the model are iteratively solved in order to maintain constant total mass
and energy fluxes through the simulation region. Although the atmosphere was
found to be highly extended, with an exobase altitude at ~6000 km at solar
minimum, the outflow remained subsonic and the escape rate was within a factor
of two of the Jeans rate for the exobase temperatures determined. This picture
is drastically different from recent predictions obtained solely using a fluid
model which, in itself, requires assumptions about atmospheric density, flow
velocity and energy flux carried away by escaping molecules at infinity. Gas
temperature, density, velocity and heat flux versus radial distance are
consistent between the hydrodynamic and kinetic model up to the exobase, only
when the energy flux across the lower boundary and escape rate used to solve
the hydrodynamic equations is obtained from the kinetic model. This limits the
applicability of fluid models to atmospheric escape problems. Finally, the
recent discovery of CO at high altitudes, the effect of Charon and the
conditions at the New Horizon encounter are briefly considered.

partitions of the system for quantum Hall states. These partitions differ from
the previously utilized orbital and particle partitions and reveal
complementary aspects of the physics of these topologically ordered systems. We
show, by constructing one to one maps to the particle partition entanglement
spectra, that the counting of the real-space entanglement spectra levels for
different particle number sectors versus their angular momentum along the
spatial partition boundary is equal to the counting of states for the system
with a number of (unpinned) bulk quasiholes excitations corresponding to the
same particle and flux numbers. This proves that, for an ideal model state
described by a conformal field theory, the real-space entanglement spectra
level counting is bounded by the counting of the conformal field theory edge
modes. This bound is known to be saturated in the thermodynamic limit (and at
finite sizes for certain states). Numerically analyzing several ideal model
states, we find that the real-space entanglement spectra indeed display the
edge modes dispersion relations expected from their corresponding conformal
field theories. We also numerically find that the real-space entanglement
spectra of Coulomb interaction ground states exhibit a series of branches,
which we relate to the model state and (above an entanglement gap) to its
quasiparticle-quasihole excitations. We also numerically compute the
entanglement entropy for the nu=1 integer quantum Hall state with real-space
partitions and compare against the analytic prediction. We find that the
entanglement entropy indeed scales linearly with the boundary length for large
enough systems, but that the attainable system sizes are still too small to
provide a reliable extraction of the sub-leading topological entanglement

structure and kinematics of molecular clouds, based on recent observations and
large-scale simulations of supersonic turbulence. Using dimensional analysis,
we first show that both linewidth-size and mass-size correlations observed on
scales 0.1-50 pc can be explained by a simple conceptual theory of compressible
turbulence without resorting to the often assumed virial equilibrium or
detailed energy balance condition. The scaling laws can be consistently
interpreted as a signature of supersonic turbulence with no need to invoke
gravity. We then show how self-similarity of structure established by the
turbulence breaks in star-forming clouds through development of gravitational
instabilities in the vicinity of the sonic scale, l_s~0.1 pc, leading to the
formation of prestellar cores.

gamma rays arising from annihilation directly into two photons at the one loop

directly into photons, with the primary decay products running in the loop.
These results are exact in the limit that dark matter annihilation is
exclusively to a single Standard Model species, occurs through the lowest
partial wave and respects CP. Away from this limit the bounds are approximate.
Our conclusions agree with the known results in the literature in the case of

that only dimensionless trilinear terms, breaking R-parity, are present in the

gauge symmetry. We use the extra U(1) charges of the matter fields to forbid
the presence in the superpotential of renormalizable and non-renormalizable
baryon number violating operators, the trilinear operator producing a domain
wall problem, and bilinear operators such as the $\mu$ term and the Majorana
masses. We apply the anomaly cancellation conditions associated to the extra

of the U(1) charges to the matter fields are viable, once extra matter is
introduced. In particular, three generations of vector-like color triplets and
$SU(2)_L$ doublets, as well as six Standard Model singlets are necessary.
Electroweak symmetry breaking is viable in the model, with wide regions of the
parameter space fulfilling the experimental constraints on the existence of a
new gauge boson $Z'$. Neutrinos and the extra gaugino mix with the MSSM
neutralinos, producing a generalized see-saw matrix that can reproduce the

the structure of these terms is different to those in AdS_5 x S^5 thanks to the

determined for three positions in NGC 456 and one position in NGC 460, first
under the assumption of uniform temperature and then allowing for the
possibility of thermal inhomogeneities. We determined t^2 values based on three
different methods: i) by comparing the temperature derived using oxygen
forbidden lines with the temperature derived using helium recombination lines,
ii) by comparing the abundances derived from oxygen forbidden lines with those
derived from oxygen recombination lines, and iii) by comparing the abundances
derived from ultraviolet carbon forbidden lines with those derived from optical
carbon recombination lines. The first two methods averaged t^2=0.067+-0.013 for
NGC 456 and t^2=0.036+-0.027 for NGC 460. These values of t^2 imply that when
gaseous abundances are determined with collisionally excited lines they are
underestimated by a factor of nearly 2. From these objects and others in the
literature, we find that in order to account for thermal inhomogeneities and
dust depletion, the O/H ratio in low metallicity HII regions should be
corrected by 0.25-0.45 dex depending on the thermal structure of the nebula, or
by 0.35 dex if such information is not available.

the mixing filters and 2) estimation of the sources. Traditional approaches
suffer from the ambiguities of arbitrary permutations and scaling in each
frequency bin of the estimated filters and/or the sources, and they are usually
corrected by taking into account some special properties of the
filters/sources. This paper focusses on the filter permutation problem in the
absence of scaling, investigating the possible use of the temporal sparsity of
the filters as a property enabling permutation correction. Theoretical and
experimental results highlight the potential as well as the limits of sparsity
as an hypothesis to obtain a well-posed permutation problem.

quasi-fission is observed for reactions with non-magic nuclei. However, the

quasi-fission, though both nuclei are doubly magic. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock
calculations predict fast equilibration of $N/Z$ in the two fragments early in
the collision. This transfer of nucleons breaks the shell effect, causing this
reaction to behave more like a non-magic one in the competition between fusion

means of 2.5D numerical simulations in a sunspot-like magnetic configuration. A
fast, essentially acoustic, wave of a given frequency and wave number is
generated below the surface and propagates upward though the Alfven/acoustic
equipartition layer where it splits into upgoing slow (acoustic) and fast
(magnetic) waves. The fast wave quickly reflects off the steep Alfven speed
gradient, but around and above this reflection height it partially converts to
Alfven waves, depending on the local relative inclinations of the background
magnetic field and the wavevector. To measure the efficiency of this conversion
to Alfven waves we calculate acoustic and magnetic energy fluxes. The
particular amplitude and phase relations between the magnetic field and
velocity oscillations help us to demonstrate that the waves produced are indeed
Alfven waves. We find that the conversion to Alfven waves is particularly
important for strongly inclined fields like those existing in sunspot
penumbrae. Equally important is the magnetic field orientation with respect to
the vertical plane of wave propagation, which we refer to as ""field azimuth"".
For field azimuth less than 90 degrees the generated Alfven waves continue
upwards, but above 90 degrees downgoing Alfven waves are preferentially
produced. This yields negative Alfven energy flux for azimuths between 90 and
180 degrees. Alfven energy fluxes may be comparable to or exceed acoustic
fluxes, depending upon geometry, though computational exigencies limit their
magnitude in our simulations.

retrospect, the focus on fundamental principles and generic techniques has been
useful not only to understand and teach the material, but also to enable an
infinite number of variations. The primary application of these generic
techniques has been obviously for distributed and parallel DBMS versions.
Today, to support the requirements of important data-intensive applications
(e.g. social networks, web data analytics, scientific applications, etc.), new
distributed data management techniques and systems (e.g. MapReduce, Hadoop,

the research community. Although they do well in terms of
consistency/flexibility/performance trade-offs for specific applications, they
seem to be ad-hoc and might hurt data interoperability. The key questions I

Is there any generic architectural model, to explain those principles? Do we
need new foundations to look at data distribution?

Digital Sky Survey are plausible dual AGN candidates, but their double-peaked
profiles could also be the result of gas kinematics or AGN-driven outflows and
jets on small or large scales. To help distinguish between these scenarios, we
have obtained spatial profiles of the AGN emission via follow-up long-slit
spectroscopy of 81 double-peaked narrow-line AGNs in SDSS at 0.03 < z < 0.36
using Lick, Palomar, and MMT Observatories. We find that all 81 systems exhibit
double AGN emission components with ~kpc projected spatial separations on the
sky, which suggests that they are produced by kpc-scale dual AGNs or kpc-scale
outflows, jets, or rotating gaseous disks. In addition, we find that the
subsample (58%) of the objects with spatially compact emission components may
be preferentially produced by dual AGNs, while the subsample (42%) with
spatially extended emission components may be preferentially produced by AGN
outflows. We also find that for 32% of the sample the two AGN emission
components are preferentially aligned with the host galaxy major axis, as
expected for dual AGNs orbiting in the host galaxy potential. Our results both
narrow the list of possible physical mechanisms producing the double AGN

We use
this to develop a rigorous excursion-set model for the formation and time
evolution of dense gas structures (GMCs, massive clumps, and cores). Supersonic
turbulence drives the density distribution to a lognormal with dispersion
increasing with Mach number; we generalize this to include scales >h (the disk
scale height), and use it to construct the statistical properties of the
density field smoothed on a scale R. We then compare conditions for
self-gravitating collapse including thermal, turbulent, and rotational support.
We show this becomes a well-defined barrier crossing problem. As such, an exact
'bound object mass function' can be derived, from scales of the sonic length to
above the disk Jeans mass. This agrees remarkably well with observed GMC mass
functions in the MW and other galaxies; the only inputs are the mass and size
of the galaxies (to normalize the model). This explains the mass function
cutoff and its power-law slope (close to, but shallower than, -2). The model
also predicts the linewidth-size and size-mass relations of clouds and the
dependence of their residuals on surface density/pressure. We use this to
predict the spatial correlation function/clustering of clouds and star
clusters; these also agree well with observations. We predict the size/mass
function of ISM 'bubbles' or 'holes', and show this can account for observed HI
hole distributions without any local feedback. We generalize the model to
construct time-dependent 'merger/fragmentation trees' which can be used to
follow cloud evolution and construct semi-analytic models for the ISM. We
provide explicit recipes to construct the trees. We use a simple example to
show that, if clouds are not destroyed in ~1-5 crossing times, then all ISM
mass would be trapped in collapsing objects even if the large-scale turbulence
were maintained.

constraints used in the construction of the so-called `new' spin-foam models
mix three of the five sectors of Plebanski theory as well as two dynamical
orientations, and this is the reason for multiple terms in the asymptotics of
the EPRL vertex amplitude as calculated by Barrett et al. Specifically, the
term equal to the usual exponential of $i$ times the Regge action corresponds
to configurations either in sector (II+) with positive orientation or sector
(II-) with negative orientation. The presence of the other terms beyond this
cause problems in the semiclassical limit of the spin-foam model when
considering multiple 4-simplices due to the fact that the different terms for
different 4-simplices mix in the semi-classical limit, leading in general to a
non-Regge action and hence non-Regge and non-gravitational configurations
persisting in the semiclassical limit.
  To correct this problem, we propose to modify the vertex so its asymptotics
include only the one term of the form $e^{iS_{\Regge}}$. To do this, an
explicit classical discrete condition is derived that isolates the desired
gravitational sector corresponding to this one term. This condition is
quantized and used to modify the vertex amplitude, yielding what we call the
`proper EPRL vertex amplitude.' This vertex still depends only on standard
SU(2) spin-network data on the boundary, is SU(2) gauge-invariant, and is
linear in the boundary state, as required. In addition, the asymptotics now
consist in the single desired term of the form $e^{iS_{\Regge}}$, and all
degenerate configurations are exponentially suppressed. A natural
generalization to the Lorentzian signature is also presented.

its relation with Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies. Then, we analyze the

field theory defined via the spectral action principle. The Starting point is a
spectral triple (A,H,D) referred to as harmonic. The construction of these data
relies on an 8-dimensional Clifford algebra. The spectral action is computed
for the product of the triple (A,H,D) with a matrix-valued spectral triple.
Renormalization theory associates to the spectral action a probability measure.
Its associated correlation functions define then a field theory. In the
perturbative approach this measure is constructed as a formal power series.
This requires explicit knowledge of the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange
equations. For the model under consideration, it turns out impossible to obtain
these solutions. An alternative approach consists in a discretization of all
variables and a numerical investigation of the behavior of the correlation
functions when the discretization becomes finer. Despite the complexity of the
approximated spectral action, some reliable numerical results are obtained,
showing that a numerical treatment of this kind of models in the Moyal matrix
basis is possible.

carried out as part of the NSF-sponsored Living with a Red Dwarf program. The
Living with a Red Dwarf program's database of dM stars with photometrically
determined rotation rates (from starspot modulations) continues to expand, as
does the inventory of archival XUV observations. When all data sets are
combined with ages from cluster/population memberships and kinematics, the
determination of Age-Rotation-Activity relationships is possible. Such
relationships have broad impacts not only on the studies of magnetic dynamo
theory & angular momentum loss of low-mass stars with deep convective zones,
but also on the suitability of planets hosted by red dwarfs to support life.
With intrinsically low luminosities (L < 0.02L_sun), the liquid water habitable
zones (HZs) for hosted planets are very close to their host stars - typically
at ~0.1-0.4 AU. Planets located close to their host stars risk damage and
atmospheric loss from coronal & chromospheric XUV radiation, flares and plasma
blasts via strong winds and coronal mass ejections. In addition, our
relationships permit the stellar ages to be determined through measures of
either the stars' rotation periods (best way) or XUV activity levels. This also
permits a determination of the ages of their hosted planets. We illustrate this
with examples of age determinations of the exoplanet systems: GJ 581 and HD

spinning radio pulsars and as more slowly spinning, strongly magnetized

The difference between the two classes may be that the INSs initially had much
stronger magnetic fields, which decayed. To test this, we used the Chandra
X-ray Observatory to observe 1RXS J072559.8-261229, a possible X-ray
counterpart to PSR J0726-2612, which, with its 3.44s period and 3e13G inferred
magnetic field strength, is the nearest and least extincted among the possible
slowly-spinning, strong-field INS progenitors (it likely is in the Gould Belt,
at ~1 kpc). We confirm the identification and find that the pulsar has a
spectrum consistent with being purely thermal, with blackbody temperature
kT=87+/-5 eV and radius R=5.7+2.6-1.3 km at a distance of 1 kpc. We detect
sinusoidal pulsations at twice the radio period with a semi-amplitude of
27\pm5%. The properties of PSR J0726-2612 strongly resemble those of the INSs,
except for its much shorter characteristic age of 200 kyr (instead of several
Myr). We conclude that PSR J0726-2612 is indeed an example of a young INS, one
that started with a magnetic field strength on the low end of those inferred
for the INSs, and that, therefore, decayed by a relatively small amount. Our
results suggest that the long-period, strong-field pulsars and the INSs are
members of the same class, and open up new opportunities to understand the
puzzling X-ray and optical emission of the INSs through radio observations of
PSR J0726-2612.

situations that involve repeatedly making decisions in an uncertain
environment, e.g. a driver deciding what route to drive to work every day.
While regret minimization has been extensively studied in repeated games, we
study regret minimization for a richer class of games called bounded memory
games. In each round of a two-player bounded memory-m game, both players
simultaneously play an action, observe an outcome and receive a reward. The
reward may depend on the last m outcomes as well as the actions of the players
in the current round. The standard notion of regret for repeated games is no
longer suitable because actions and rewards can depend on the history of play.
To account for this generality, we introduce the notion of k-adaptive regret,
which compares the reward obtained by playing actions prescribed by the
algorithm against a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary with the reward obtained
by the best expert in hindsight against the same adversary. Roughly, a
hypothetical k-adaptive adversary adapts her strategy to the defender's actions
exactly as the real adversary would within each window of k rounds. Our
definition is parametrized by a set of experts, which can include both fixed
and adaptive defender strategies.
  We investigate the inherent complexity of and design algorithms for adaptive
regret minimization in bounded memory games of perfect and imperfect
information. We prove a hardness result showing that, with imperfect
information, any k-adaptive regret minimizing algorithm (with fixed strategies
as experts) must be inefficient unless NP=RP even when playing against an
oblivious adversary. In contrast, for bounded memory games of perfect and
imperfect information we present approximate 0-adaptive regret minimization
algorithms against an oblivious adversary running in time n^{O(1)}.

We demonstrate that the zero-crossing, r_c, of the 2-point galaxy correlation

simulations, we also show that the pristine zero-crossing is unaltered by
non-linear evolution of density fluctuations, redshift distortions and galaxy

maps amplitudes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to frame-independent light-front

effective confining light-front QCD Hamiltonian and a single-variable
light-front Schrodinger equation which determines the eigenspectrum and the
light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular
momentum. The coordinate z in AdS space is identified with a Lorentz-invariant
coordinate zeta which measures the separation of the constituents within a
hadron at equal light-front time and determines the off-shell dynamics of the
bound-state wavefunctions and the fall-off in the invariant mass of the
constituents. The soft-wall holographic model, modified by a positive-sign
dilaton metric, leads to a remarkable one-parameter description of
nonperturbative hadron dynamics -- a semi-classical frame-independent first
approximation to the spectra and light-front wavefunctions of meson and
baryons. The model predicts a Regge spectrum of linear trajectories with the
same slope in the leading orbital angular momentum L of hadrons and the radial
quantum number n. The hadron eigensolutions projected on the free Fock basis
provides the complete set of valence and non-valence light-front Fock state
wavefunctions which describe the hadron's momentum and spin distributions
needed to compute measures of hadron structure at the quark and gluon level.
The effective confining potential also creates quark- antiquark pairs. The
AdS/QCD model can be systematically improved by using its complete orthonormal
solutions to diagonalize the full QCD light-front Hamiltonian or by applying
the Lippmann-Schwinger method to systematically include the QCD interaction
terms. A new perspective on quark and gluon condensates is also presented.

mass-follows-light. With the additional assumption that any dark matter does
not follow the light, the dynamical masses of dense galaxies provide a direct
measurement of stellar masses. Our dynamical masses (M_dyn), obtained from the
spherical Jeans equations, are only weakly sensitive to the choice of
anisotropy (\beta) due to the relatively large aperture of the SDSS fiber for
these galaxies: R_ap \simeq 1.5 R_e. Assuming isotropic orbits (\beta=0) we
find a median log_{10} (M_dyn/M_sps) = 0.233 \pm 0.003, consistent with a
Salpeter IMF, while more bottom heavy IMFs and standard Milky-Way IMFs are
strongly disfavored. Our results are consistent with, but do not require, a
dependence of the IMF on dynamical mass or velocity dispersion. We find
evidence for a color dependence to the IMF such that redder galaxies have
heavier IMFs with M_dyn/M_sps \propto (g-r)^{1.13\pm0.09}. This may reflect a
more fundamental dependence of the IMF on the age or metallicity of a stellar
population, or the density at which the stars formed.

quite remarkable that the expression of ""probability"" has similarities with the
square of Laughlin wave function. Next, we introduce the ""partition function"",

distribution during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of liver

is employed to compute the temperature field in the hepatic cancerous region.
The model is based on the linear Westervelt and bioheat equations as well as
the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations for the liver parenchyma and blood
vessels. The effect of acoustic streaming is also taken into account in the
present HIFU simulation study. Different blood vessel diameters and focal point
locations were investigated. We found from this three-dimensional numerical
study that in large blood vessels both the convective cooling and acoustic
streaming can change considerably the temperature field and the thermal lesion
near blood vessels. If the blood vessel is located within the beam width, both
acoustic streaming and blood flow cooling effects should be taken into account.
The predicted temperature difference for the cases considered with and without
acoustic streaming effect is 54 % in regions close to the vessel wall. The
necrosed volume can be reduced about 30 %, when taking into account acoustic
streaming effect.

moments of Pd and oxygens. Coincidentally only one spin channel remains
metallic due to the twice larger width of the Pd 4d bands than the Ni 3d bands
in NiCrO$_3$, indicating CHM in ambient pressure. Inclusion of SOC as well as
correlation effects (LDA+U+SOC) produces a SOC constant enhanced twice over the
value of LDA+SOC, leading to unusually large orbital moment of --0.25 $\mu_B$
on Pd. However, the half-metallicity still survives, so that a transition of
CHM to a half-metallic ferrimagnet occurs due to Coulomb enhanced SOC. On the

parametrization makes the theory much easier. A version of Palais' theorem for

checking the data we find that, for any pair of players, the probability that

the rank difference between the pair. Such a dependence can be well fitted to a
sigmoidal function. By using this feature, we propose a simple toy model which

symmetry precisely. Monopole clusters generalise the Bolognesi magnetic bag
solution of the same charge, but they are always larger. Selected density
profiles give structures analogous to planets of uniform density, and galaxies
with a density decaying as the inverse square of the distance from the centre.
The Bolognesi bag itself has features analogous to a black hole, and this
analogy between monopole clusters and astrophysical objects with or without

certain exact, platonic monopoles of small charge have sizes and other features

time-dependent and may become unstable once disturbed. Specifically for a
homologously collapse of stellar core characterized by a polytropic exponent
\Gamma=4/3, we examine oscillations and/or instabilities of three dimensional
(3D) general polytropic perturbations. For compressible 3D perturbations, the
polytropic index \gamma of perturbations can differ from \Gamma=4/3 of the
general polytropic hydrodynamic background flow. Our model formulation here is
more general and allows the existence of internal gravity g(-)-modes and/or
g(+)-modes. Eigenvalues and eigen-functions of various oscillatory and unstable
perturbation modes are computed. As studied in several specialized cases of
Goldreich & Weber and of Cao & Lou, we further confirm that acoustic p-modes
and surface f-modes remain stable in the current more general situations. In
comparison, g(-)-modes and sufficiently high radial order g(+)-modes are
unstable, leading to inevitable convective motions within the collapsing
stellar interior. Unstable growths of 3D g-mode disturbances are governed
dominantly by the angular momentum conservation and modified by the gas
pressure restoring force. We note in particular that unstable temporal growths
of 3D vortical perturbations exist even when the specific entropy distribution
becomes uniform and \gamma=\Gamma=4/3. Conceptually, unstable g-modes might
bear conceivable physical consequences on supernova explosions, the initial
kicks of nascent proto-neutron stars (PNSs) and break-ups of the collapsing
core, while unstable growths of vortical perturbations can lead to fast spins
of compact objects and other relevant results.

apply the joint solution of three MFRS equations for concordances quantize
bounce Planck hierarchy steps. Simultaneous scaling solutions of MFRS equations
in logarithmic scale appropriate to three cosmological epoch's, yields a
currently testable predictions regarding the Dark Matter {\Omega}_{DM} = 0.25,
and Dark Energy {\Omega}_{DE} = 0.75. These predictions coincides with the
recent observational data from WMAP and other a key supernovae SNe Ia findings.
Thus, the presence of Dark Matter and Dark Energy had already been not only
detected observationally, but also confirmed theoretically with the very
compelling accuracy. From the WMAP7 and our predicted ages we find a value of
the Hubble constant H_0 = 65.6 km * s^{-1} Mpc^{-1} which is excellent
agreement with the Planck 2013 results XVI. Compared with the ""holographic

corresponds to an possible observable-geophysical parameter g_U =
