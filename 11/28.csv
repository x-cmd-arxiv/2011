tensor product of random quantum channels. Depending on natural assumptions
that we make on the states, the eigenvalues of their outputs have new
properties which we describe. Our motivation is provided by the additivity
questions in quantum information theory, and we build on the idea that a Bell
state sent through a product of conjugated random channels has at least one
large eigenvalue. We generalize this setting in two directions. First, we
investigate general entangled pure inputs and show that that Bell states give
the least entropy among those inputs in the asymptotic limit. We then study
mixed input states, and obtain new multi-scale random matrix models that allow
to quantify the difference of the outputs' eigenvalues between a quantum
channel and its complementary version in the case of a non-pure input.

  when the number of components is unknown","This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of summarizing the posterior distributions
that typically arise, in a Bayesian framework, when dealing with signal
decomposition problems with unknown number of components. Such posterior
distributions are defined over union of subspaces of differing dimensionality
and can be sampled from using modern Monte Carlo techniques, for instance the
increasingly popular RJ-MCMC method. No generic approach is available, however,
to summarize the resulting variable-dimensional samples and extract from them
component-specific parameters.
  We propose a novel approach to this problem, which consists in approximating
the complex posterior of interest by a ""simple""---but still
variable-dimensional---parametric distribution. The distance between the two
distributions is measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a
Stochastic EM-type algorithm, driven by the RJ-MCMC sampler, is proposed to
estimate the parameters. The proposed algorithm is illustrated on the
fundamental signal processing example of joint detection and estimation of
sinusoids in white Gaussian noise.

outer cylinders with a radius ratio of \eta = 0.716 is experimentally studied.
From global torque measurements, we analyse the dimensionless angular velocity
flux Nu_\omega(Ta, a) as a function of the Taylor number Ta and the angular
velocity ratio a = -\omega_o/\omega_i in the large-Taylor-number regime 10^{11}
\lesssim Ta \lesssim 10^{13}. We analyse the data with the common power-law
ansatz for the dimensionless angular velocity transport flux Nu_\omega(Ta, a) =
f(a)Ta^\gamma, with an amplitude f(a) and an exponent \gamma. The data are
consistent with one effective exponent \gamma = 0.39\pm0.03 for all a. The
amplitude of the angular velocity flux f(a) = Nu_\omega(Ta, a)/Ta^0.39 is
measured to be maximal at slight counter-rotation, namely at an angular
velocity ratio of a_opt = 0.33\pm0.04. This value is theoretically interpreted
as the result of a competition between the destabilizing inner cylinder
rotation and the stabilizing but shear-enhancing outer cylinder
counter-rotation. With the help of laser Doppler anemometry, we provide angular
velocity profiles and identify the radial position r_n of the neutral line.
While for moderate counter-rotation -0.40 \omega_i \lesssim \omega_o < 0, the
neutral line still remains close to the outer cylinder and the probability
distribution function (p.d.f.) of the bulk angular velocity is observed to be
monomodal. For stronger counter-rotation the neutral line is pushed inwards
towards the inner cylinder; in this regime the p.d.f. of the bulk angular
velocity becomes bimodal, reflecting intermittent bursts of turbulent
structures beyond the neutral line into the outer flow domain, which otherwise
is stabilized by the counter-rotating outer cylinder. Finally, a hypothesis is
offered allowing a unifying view for all these various results.

measurement independence may be dropped to obtain a related result having the

Population III (Pop III) stars, or from high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), again
involving Pop III stars, influences the mode of second generation star
formation. We track the evolution of the black hole accretion rate and the
associated X-ray feedback starting with the death of the Pop III progenitor
star inside a minihalo and following the subsequent evolution of the black hole
as the minihalo grows to become an atomically cooling galaxy. We find that
X-ray photoionization heating from a stellar-mass BH is able to quench further
star formation in the host halo at all times before the halo enters the atomic
cooling phase. X-ray radiation from a HMXB, assuming a luminosity close to the
Eddington value, exerts an even stronger, and more diverse, feedback on star
formation. It photoheats the gas inside the host halo, but also promotes the
formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling of gas in the intergalactic medium
and in nearby minihalos, leading to a net increase in the number of stars
formed at early times. Our simulations further show that the radiative feedback
from the first BHs may strongly suppress early BH growth, thus constraining
models for the formation of supermassive BHs.

may be compared to the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), except that it will have
about 45 times the sensitivity, and five times the resolution. EMU will also
have much better sensitivity to diffuse emission than previous large surveys,
and is expected to produce a large catalogue of relics, tailed galaxies, and
haloes, and will increase the number of known clusters by a significant factor.

two types of two leg ladders (without flux and with flux $\pi$ per plaquette)
have commensurate pair-density wave (PDW) phases. In the case of the
conventional (flux-less) ladder the PDW arises when certain filling fractions
for which commensurability conditions are met.
  For the flux $\pi$ ladder the PDW phase is generally present. The PDW phase
is characterized by a finite spin gap and a superconducting order parameter
with a finite (commensurate in this case) wave vector and power-law
superconducting correlations. In this phase the uniform superconducting order
parameter, the $2k_F$ charge-density-wave (CDW) order parameter and the
spin-density- wave N\'eel order parameter exhibit short range (exponentially
decaying) correlations. We discuss in detail the case in which the bonding band
of the ladder is half filled for which the PDW phase appears even at weak
coupling. The PDW phase is shown to be dual to a uniform superconducting (SC)
phase with quasi long range order. By making use of bosonization and the
renormalization group we determine the phase diagram of the spin-gapped regime
and study the quantum phase transition. The phase boundary between PDW and the
uniform SC ordered phases is found to be in the Ising universality class. We
generalize the analysis to the case of other commensurate fillings of the
bonding band, where we find higher order commensurate PDW states for which we
determine the form of the effective bosonized field theory and discuss the
phase diagram. We compare our results with recent findings in the
Kondo-Heisenberg chain. We show that the formation of PDW order in the ladder
embodies the notion of intertwined orders.

trajectory of moving reflecting obstacles with broken rays, or rays reflecting
at an obstacle. While in tomography the focus of the reconstruction method is
to recover the velocity structure of the domain, the shape and trajectory
reconstruction procedure directly finds the shape and trajectory of the
obstacle. The physical signal carrier for this innovative method are ultrasonic
beams. When the speed of sound is constant, the rays are straight line segments
and the shape and trajectory of moving objects will be reconstructed with
methods based on the travel time equation and ellipsoid geometry. For variable
speed of sound, we start with the eikonal equation and a system of differential
equations that has its origins in acoustics and seismology. In this case, the
rays are curves that are not necessarily straight line segments and we develop
algorithms for shape and trajectory tracking based on the numerical solution of
these equations. We present methods and algorithms for shape and trajectory
tracking of moving obstacles with reflected rays when the location of the
receiver of the reflected ray is not known in advance. The shape and trajectory
tracking method is very efficient because it is not necessary for the reflected
signal to traverse the whole domain or the same path back to the transmitter.
It could be received close to the point of reflection or far away from the
transmitter. This optimizes the energy spent by transmitters for tracking the
object, reduces signal attenuation and improves image resolution. It is a safe
and secure method. We also present algorithms for tracking the shape and
trajectory of absorbing obstacles. The new methods and algorithms for shape and
trajectory tracking enable new applications and an application to one-hop
Internet routing is presented.

the disparity between two species and the electric field decay at an

considerably complicates detailed calculations in any such scenario, is that
once one violates Lorentz invariance the analysis of thresholds in both

general threshold theorems that depend only on the existence of some energy
momentum relation E(p), eschewing even assumptions of isotropy or monotonicity.
We shall argue that there are physically interesting situations where such a
level of generality is called for, and that existing (partial) results in the
literature make unnecessary technical assumptions. Even in this most general of
settings, we show that at threshold all final state particles move with the

parallel/anti-parallel to the final state particles. In contrast the various
3-momenta can behave in a complicated and counter-intuitive manner.

certain symmetry, which can all be smoothly connected to the same trivial
product state if we break the symmetry. For non-interacting fermion systems
with time reversal (T), charge conjugation (C), and/or U(1) (N) symmetries, the
total symmetry group can depend on the relations between those symmetry
operations, such as T N T^{-1}= N or T N T^{-1}= -N. As a result, the SPT
phases of those fermion systems with different symmetry groups have different
classifications. In this paper, we use Kitaev's K-theory approach to classify
the gapped free fermion phases for those possible symmetry groups. In
particular, we can view the U(1) as a spin rotation. We find that
superconductors with the S_z spin rotation symmetry are classified by Z in even
dimensions, while superconductors with the time reversal plus the S_z spin
rotation symmetries are classified by Z in odd dimensions. We show that all 10
classes of gapped free fermion phases can be realized by electron systems with
certain symmetries. We also point out that to properly describe the symmetry of
a fermionic system, we need to specify its full symmetry group that includes
the fermion number parity transformation (-)^N. The full symmetry group is
actually a projective symmetry group.

Nonminimal extensions contain, in addition, $N_f$ right-handed fermions. Our
task is to derive expressions for the $\beta$ functions valid to all orders. To
this end we use a variety of methods: (i) perturbative analysis; (ii) instanton
calculus; (iii) analysis of the supercurrent supermultiplet (the so-called
hypercurrent) and its anomalies, and some other arguments. All these arguments,
combined, indicate a direct parallel between the heterotic $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$
CP(1) models and four-dimensional super-Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the
minimal $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ CP(1) model is similar to ${\mathcal N}=1$
supersymmetric gluodynamics. Its exact $\beta$ function can be found; it has
the structure of the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (NSVZ) $\beta$
function of supersymmetric gluodynamics. The passage to nonminimal
$\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ sigma models is equivalent to adding matter. In this case
an NSVZ-type exact relation between the $\beta$ function and the anomalous
dimensions $\gamma$ of the ""matter"" fields is established. We derive an analog
of the Konishi anomaly. At large $N_f$ our $\beta$ function develops an
infrared fixed point at small values of the coupling constant (analogous to the
Banks-Zaks fixed point). Thus, we reliably predict the existence of a conformal
window. At $N_f=1$ the model under consideration reduces to the well-known
$\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ CP(1) model.

fabrication of molecular spintronics devices is extremely challenging and
inhibits the insightful experimental studies. Recently, we produced Multilayer
Edge Molecular Spintronics Devices (MEMSDs) by bridging the organometallic
molecular clusters (OMCs) across a ~2 nm thick insulator of a magnetic tunnel
junction (MTJ), along its exposed side edges. These MEMSDs exhibited
unprecedented increase in exchange coupling between ferromagnetic films and
dramatic changes in the spin transport. This paper focuses on the dramatic
current suppression phenomenon exhibited by MEMSDs at room temperature. In the
event of current suppression, the effective MEMESDs' current reduced by as much
as six orders in magnitude as compared to the leakage current level of a MTJ
test bed. In the suppressed current state, MEMSD's transport could be affected
by the temperature, light radiation, and magnetic field. In the suppressed
current state MEMSD also showed photovoltaic effect. This study motivates the
investigation of MEMSDs involving other combinations of MTJs and promising
magnetic molecules like single molecular magnets and porphyrin. Observation of
current suppression on similar systems will unequivocally establish the utility
of MEMSD approach.

consider the possibility of detecting the ionized bubble around a z=8 quasar
using targeted redshifted 21-cm observations with the GMRT. The apparent shape
and size of the ionized bubble, as seen by a distant observer, depends on the
parameters \dot{N}_{phs}/C, x_HI/C and \tau_Q where \dot{N}_{phs}, \tau_Q, x_HI
and C are respectively the photon emission rate, age of the quasar, the neutral
fraction and clumping factor of the IGM.Here we have analytically estimated the
shape and size of a quasar's ionized bubble assuming an uniform IGM and
ignoring other ionizing sources besides the quasar, and used this as a template
for matched filter bubble search with the GMRT visibility data. We have assumed
that \dot{N}_{phs} is known from the infrared spectrum and C from theoretical
considerations, which gives us two free parameters x_HI and \tau_Q for bubble.
Considering 1,000 hr of observation, we find that there is a reasonably large
region of parameter space where a 3\sigma detection is possible. We also find
that it will be possible to place lower limits on x_HI and \tau_Q with this
observation. Deeper follow up observations can place upper limits on \tau_Q and
x_HI. Value of C affect the estimation of x_HI but the estimation of \tau_Q
remains unaffected.We have used a semi-numerical technique to simulate the
apparent shape and size of quasar ionized bubbles considering the presence of
other ionizing sources and inhomogeneities in the IGM. The presence of other
sources increase the size of the quasar bubble, leading to underestimation of
x_HI. Clustering of other ionizing sources around the quasar can produce severe
distortions in bubble's shape. However, this does not severely affect parameter
estimation in the bubbles that are large.

example, big rip results from the evolution of the phantom field with an
exponential potential and little rip stems from a quadratic potential in
general relativity (GR). By choosing the same potential as in GR, we suggest a
new mechanism to avoid these unexpected fates (big and little rip) in the
inverse-\textit{R} gravity. As a pedagogical illustration, we give an exact
solution where phantom field leads to a power-law evolution of the scale factor
in an exponential type potential. We also find the sufficient condition for a
universe in which the equation of state parameter crosses $w=-1$ divide. The
phantom field with different potentials, including quadratic, cubic, quantic,
exponential and logarithmic potentials are studied via numerical calculation in
the inverse-\textit{R} gravity with $R^{2}$ correction. The singularity is
avoidable under all these potentials. Hence, we conclude that the avoidance of

triggering process for star formation remain to be resolved. Recently, episodic
star formation, powered by changes in the gas content, has been suggested.
Classical Cepheid variable stars have pulsation periods that decrease with
increasing age, so it is possible to probe the star-formation history on the
basis of the distribution of their periods. Here we report the presence of
three classical Cepheids in the nuclear bulge with pulsation periods of
approximately 20 days, within 40 parsecs (projected distance) of the central
black hole. No Cepheids with longer or shorter periods were found. We infer
that there was a period about 25 million years ago, and possibly lasting until

million years ago.

an upper bound that grows with the spatial volume but decreases exponentially
with an increase in the temporal extent of the lattice. This analytic but
approximate result is confirmed with a numerical study in four-flavor QCD in

large positive \DeltaS, behaving like a paramagnet. On the basis of this

density profile we obtained is characterized by the radial scalelength which is
close to the photometrical one and is in a good agreement with the rotation
curve of M33 and with the mass-to-light ratio corresponding to the observed
color indices. However at the galactocentric distance $r>7$ kpc the dynamical
overheating of the disk remains quite possible. A thickness of the stellar disk
of M33 should increase outwards. The dark halo mass exceeds the mass of the
disk at $r>$ 7 kpc. The obtained radial profile of the disk surface density and
the radial gradient of $O/H$ are used to calculate the effective oxygen yield
$Y_{eff}$ in the frame of the instantaneous recycling approximation. It is
shown that $Y_{eff}$ increases with radius which may indicate that the role of
accretion of metal-poor gas in the chemical evolution of interstellar medium
decreases outwards.

marking the birth of the first objects massive enough to yield large numbers of
ionizing photons. The mechanism and timescale of reionization remain largely
unknown. Measurements of the CMB Doppler effect from ionizing bubbles embedded
in large-scale velocity streams (the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect)
can constrain the duration of reionization. When combined with large-scale CMB
polarization measurements, the evolution of the ionized fraction can be
inferred. Using new multi-frequency data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT),
we show that the ionized fraction evolved relatively rapidly. For our basic
foreground model, we find the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power sourced by
reionization at l=3000 to be <= 2.1 micro K^2 at 95% CL. Using reionization
simulations, we translate this to a limit on the duration of reionization of
Delta z <= 4.4 (95% CL). We find that this constraint depends on assumptions
about the angular correlation between the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power and
the cosmic infrared background (CIB). Introducing the degree of correlation as
a free parameter, we find that the limits on kSZ power weaken to <= 4.9 micro
K^2, implying Delta z <= 7.9 (95% CL). We combine the SPT constraint on the
duration of reionization with the WMAP7 measurement of the integrated optical
depth to probe the cosmic ionization history. We find that reionization ended
with 95% CL at z > 7.2 under the assumption of no tSZ-CIB correlation, and
z>5.8 when correlations are allowed. Improved constraints from the full SPT
data set in conjunction with upcoming Herschel and Planck data should detect
extended reionization at >95% CL provided Delta z >= 4. (abbreviated)

investigate the issue of temperature associated with a spherically symmetric
dynamical space-times. Firstly, we review the semi-classical tunneling method,
then we introduce the Unruh--DeWitt detector approach. We show that for the
generic static black hole case and the FRW de Sitter case, making use of
peculiar Kodama trajectories, semiclassical and quantum field theoretic
techniques give the same standard and well known thermal interpretation, with
an associated temperature, corrected by appropriate Tolman factors. For a FRW
space-time interpolating de Sitter space with the Einstein--de Sitter universe
(that is a more realistic situation in the frame of $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies),
we show that the detector response splits into a de Sitter contribution plus a
fluctuating term containing no trace of Boltzmann-like factors, but rather
describing the way thermal equilibrium is reached in the late time limit. As a
consequence, and unlike the case of black holes, the identification of the
dynamical surface gravity of a cosmological trapping horizon as an effective
temperature parameter seems lost, at least for our co-moving simplified
detectors. The possibility remains that a detector performing a proper motion
along a Kodama trajectory may register something more, in which case the
horizon surface gravity would be associated more likely to vacuum correlations
than to particle creation.

useful in analyzing the gravitational lens effects. Our formulae are widely
applicable over the range of the density parameter and the redshift with
sufficiently small uncertainties. In particular, in the range of density
parameter $0.3 \leq \Omega_{\rm m} \leq 1$ and redshift $0.03 \leq z \leq
1000$, the relative error for the luminosity distance by our formula is always
smaller than that of the recent work by Wickramasinghe and Ukwatta (2010).

processes originating from compact sources within our Galaxy and beyond. Radio
frequency signals emitted from these objects provide a means to study the
intervening medium through which they travel. Next generation radio telescopes
are designed to explore the vast unexplored parameter space of high time
resolution astronomy, but require High Performance Computing (HPC) solutions to
process the enormous volumes of data that are produced by these telescopes. We
have developed a combined software /hardware solution (code named ARTEMIS) for
real-time searches for millisecond radio transients, which uses GPU technology
to remove interstellar dispersion and detect millisecond radio bursts from
astronomical sources in real-time. Here we present an introduction to ARTEMIS.
We give a brief overview of the software pipeline, then focus specifically on
the intricacies of performing incoherent de-dispersion. We present results from
two brute-force algorithms. The first is a GPU based algorithm, designed to
exploit the L1 cache of the NVIDIA Fermi GPU. Our second algorithm is CPU based
and exploits the new AVX units in Intel Sandy Bridge CPUs.

protoplanetary discs is becoming increasingly challenged by the more detailed
observational and theoretical explorations. Calculation of dust temperature is
one of the key features we strive to understand and a necessary step in image
and flux reconstruction. We explore coexistence of small (0.1mic radius) and
big (2mic radius) dust grains can coexist at distances from the star where
small grains would not survive without big grains shielding them from the
direct starlight. The study required a high resolution radiative transfer
calculation capable of resolving large temperature gradients and disc surface
curvatures caused by dust sublimation. The calculation was also capable of
resolving temperature inversion effect in big grains, where the maximum dust
temperature is at visual optical depth of tau_V~1.5. We also show disc images
and spectra, with disentangled contributions from small and big grains. Big
grains dominate the near IR flux, mainly because of the bright hot inner disc
rim. Small grains populate almost the entire inner disc interior, but appear in
the disc surface at distances 2.2 times larger than the closest distance of big
grains from the star. Nevertheless, small grains can contribute to the image
surface brightness at smaller radii because they are visible below the
optically thin surface defined by stellar heating. Our calculations demonstrate
that the sublimation temperature does not provide a unique boundary condition
for radiative transfer models of optically thick discs. The source of this
problem is the temperature inversion effect, which allows survival of optically
thin configurations of big grains closer to the star than the inner radius of
optically thick disc. Future attempts to derive more realistic multigrain inner
disc models will require the numerical resolution ...

The spatial domain, in the continuous theory represented by a
finite-dimensional smooth manifold with boundary, is replaced by a homological
manifold-like simplicial complex and its augmented circumcentric dual. The
smooth differential forms, in discrete setting, are mirrored by cochains on the
primal and dual complexes, while the discrete exterior derivative is defined to
be the coboundary operator. This approach of discrete differential geometry,
rather than discretizing the partial differential equations, allows to first
discretize the underlying Stokes-Dirac structure and then to impose the
corresponding finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian dynamics. In this manner, a
number of important intrinsically topological and geometrical properties of the
system are preserved.

processes are necessary to explain the existence of slowly rotating
pre-main-sequence stars. In the present paper, we extend the stellar spin model
to include the effect of a spin-down torque that arises from an
accretion-powered stellar wind. For a range of magnetic field strengths,
accretion rates, initial spin rates, and mass outflow rates, the modeled stars
exhibit rotation periods within the range of 1--10 days in the age range of
1--3 Myr. This range coincides with the bulk of the observed rotation periods,
with the slow rotators corresponding to stars with the lowest accretion rates,
strongest magnetic fields, and/or highest stellar wind mass outflow rates. We
also make a direct, quantitative comparison between the accretion-powered
stellar wind scenario and the two types of disk-locking models (namely the

This motivates the use of a density based metric for semisupervised learning.
We analyze this setting and make the following contributions - (a) we propose a
semi-supervised learner that uses a density-sensitive kernel and show that it
provides better performance than any supervised learner if the density support
set has a small condition number and (b) we show that it is possible to adapt
to the degree of semi-supervisedness using data-dependent choice of a parameter

are small because neutrinos are Majorana particles with masses inversely
proportional to the large scale M of lepton number (L) violation, which turns
out to be compatible with the GUT scale. We have understood that there is no
contradiction between large neutrino mixings and small quark mixings, even in
the context of GUTs and that neutrino masses fit well in the SUSY GUT picture.
Out of equilibrium decays with CP and L violation of heavy RH neutrinos can
produce a B-L asymmetry, then converted near the weak scale by instantons into
an amount of B asymmetry compatible with observations (baryogenesis via
leptogenesis). It appears that active neutrinos are not a significant component
of Dark Matter in the Universe. A long list of models have been formulated over
the years to understand neutrino masses and mixings. With the continuous
improvement of the data most of the models have been discarded by experiment.
The surviving models still span a wide range going from a maximum of symmetry,
with discrete non-abelian flavour groups, to the opposite extreme of anarchy.

have been addressed by several theoretical and numerical studies. The system
properties have been typically profiled as a function of ring contour length at
fixed solution density. Here, we use a different approach to investigate
numerically the equilibrium and kinetic properties of solutions of model ring
polymers. Specifically, the ring contour length is maintained fixed, while the
interplay of inter- and intra-chain entanglement is modulated by varying both
solution density (from infinite dilution up to \approx 40 % volume occupancy)
and ring topology (by considering unknotted and trefoil-knotted chains). The
equilibrium metric properties of rings with either topology are found to be
only weakly affected by the increase of solution density. Even at the highest
density, the average ring size, shape anisotropy and length of the knotted
region differ at most by 40% from those of isolated rings. Conversely, kinetics
are strongly affected by the degree of inter-chain entanglement: for both
unknots and trefoils the characteristic times of ring size relaxation,
reorientation and diffusion change by one order of magnitude across the
considered range of concentrations. Yet, significant topology-dependent
differences in kinetics are observed only for very dilute solutions (much below
the ring overlap threshold). For knotted rings, the slowest kinetic process is
found to correspond to the diffusion of the knotted region along the ring
backbone.

understanding based on Maldacena AdS/CFT. We show that the brick-wall
modification of a Klein Gordon field in the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state on

purposes is to point out a close connection, for general AdS/CFT situations,
between the puzzle raised by Arnsdorf and Smolin regarding the relationship
between Rehren's algebraic holography and mainstream AdS/CFT and the puzzle
embodied in the 'correspondence principle' proposed by Mukohyama and Israel in
their work on the brick-wall approach to black hole entropy. Working on the
assumption that similar results will hold for bulk QFT other than the Klein
Gordon field and for Schwarzschild AdS in other dimensions, and recalling the
first author's proposed resolution to the Mukohyama-Israel puzzle based on his
'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis', we argue that, in Maldacena AdS/CFT,
the algebra of the boundary CFT is isomorphic only to a proper subalgebra of
the bulk algebra, albeit (at non-zero temperature) the (GNS) Hilbert spaces of
bulk and boundary theories are still the 'same' -- the total bulk state being
pure, while the boundary state is mixed (thermal). We also argue from the
finiteness of its boundary (and hence, on our assumptions, also bulk) entropy
at finite temperature, that the Rehren dual of the Maldacena boundary CFT
cannot itself be a QFT and must, instead, presumably be something like a string
theory.

uniaxial strain was applied on the sample to overcome the twinning effect in

undergoes an orbital-dependent reconstruction in the nematic state, primarily
involving the dxy- and dyz-dominated bands. These bands strongly hybridize with
each other, inducing a band splitting, while the dxz-dominated bands only
exhibit an energy shift without any reconstruction. These findings suggest that
the development of orbital-dependent spin polarization is likely the dominant
force to drive the nematicity, while the ferro-orbital ordering between dxz and
dyz orbitals can only play a minor role here.

were excited by linearly polarized light from an extended cavity diode laser
with polarization vector perpendicular to the light's propagation direction and
magnetic field, and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) was observed along the
direction of the magnetic field, which was scanned. A low-contrast bright
resonance was observed at low laser power densities when the laser was tuned to
the Fg=2 --> Fe=3 transition of Rb-87 and near to the Fg=3 --> Fe=4 transition
of Rb-85. The bright resonance became dark as the laser power density was
increased above 0.6mW/cm2 or 0.8 mW/cm2, respectively. When the Fg=2 --> Fe=3
transition of Rb-87 was excited with circularly polarized light in a second set

theoretical model, although the theoretical model was not able to describe

based MTJs has been insured by a thick MgO barrier and its 3.8% lattice
mismatch with the Co2FeAl electrode. Our analysis implicates a correlated
structural-transport approach. The crystallographic coherence, in the real
space, is investigated using High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy
phase analysis. The electronic transport experiments in variable temperature,
fitted with a theoretical extended-Glazman-Matveev model, address different
levels of the tunneling mechanisms from direct to multi-center hopping. We
demonstrate a double negative impact of dislocations, as extended defects, on
the tunneling polarization. Firstly, the breaking of the crystal symmetry
destroys the longitudinal and lateral coherence of the propagating Bloch
functions. This affects the symmetry filtering efficiency of the Delta_1 states
across the (100) MgO barriers and reduces the associated effective tunneling
polarization. Secondly, dislocations provide localized states within the MgO
gap. This determines temperature activated spin-conserving inelastic tunneling
through chains of defects which are responsible for the one order of magnitude
drop of the tunnel magnetoresistance from low to room temperature.

sample of 200 nearby galaxies, mainly S0s. It uses deep Ks -band images,
typically reaching a surface brightness of 23.5 mag arcsec^(-2) . Detailed
visual and photometric classifications were made, for the first time coding
also the lenses in a systematic manner. As a comparison sample, a similar sized
spiral galaxy sample with similar image quality was used. The main emphasis
were to study whether the S0s are former spirals in which star formation has
been ceased, and also, how robust are bars in galaxies. Based on our analysis
the Hubble sequence was revisited: following the early idea by van den Bergh we
suggested that the S0s are spread throughout the Hubble sequence in parallel
tuning forks as spirals (S0a, S0b, S0c etc.). This is evidenced by our improved
bulge-to-total (B/T) flux ratios, reaching as small values as typically found
in late-type spirals. The properties of bulges and disks in S0s were found to
be similar to those in spirals. Also, the masses and scale parameters of the
bulges and disks were found to be coupled. Bars were found to be fairly robust
both in S0s and spirals, but inspite of that bars might evolve significantly
within the Hubble sequence.

considered by explicitly computing the time dependent molecular polarization
from the coupled dynamics of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in a
mean-field mixed quantum-classical approximation. The oligomers are described
by the SSH Hamiltonian and the effect of decoherence is incorporated by
propagating an ensemble of quantum-classical trajectories with initial
conditions obtained by sampling the Wigner distribution of the nuclear degrees
of freedom. The decoherence for superpositions between the ground and excited
and between pairs of excited states is considered for chains of different
length, and the dynamics is discussed in terms of the nuclear overlap function
that appears in the off-diagonal elements of the electronic reduced density
matrix. For long oligomers the loss of coherence occurs in tens of
femtoseconds. This timescale is determined by the initial decay of the nuclear
overlap and by the decay of population into other electronic states, and is
relatively insensitive to the type and class of superposition considered. By
contrast, for smaller oligomers the decoherence timescale depends strongly on
the initially selected superposition, with superpositions that can decay as
fast as 50 fs and as slow as 250 fs. The long-lived superpositions are such
that little population is transferred to other electronic states and for which
the vibronic dynamics is relatively harmonic.

the surface of the earth is exactly the same as that in vacuum to first order

sensitivity analysis of these parameters and other related parameters are still
not sufficient for detecting the behaviors of the dispersion and dissipation
relations of the MRT-LBM. Previous researches have shown that the bulk
dissipation in the MRT-LBM induces a significant over-damping of acoustic
disturbances. This indicates that MRT-LBM cannot be used to obtain the correct
behavior of pressure fluctuations because of the fixed bulk relaxation
parameter. In order to cure this problem, an effective algorithm has been
proposed for recovering the linearized Navier-Stokes equations from the
linearized MRT-LBM. The recovered L-NSE appear as in matrix form with arbitrary
order of the truncation errors with respect to ${\delta}t$. Then, in
wave-number space, the first/second-order sensitivity analyses of matrix
eigenvalues are used to address the sensitivity of the wavenumber magnitudes to
the dispersion-dissipation relations. By the first-order sensitivity analysis,
the numerical behaviors of the group velocity of the MRT-LBM are first
obtained. Afterwards, the distribution sensitivities of the matrix eigenvalues
corresponding to the linearized form of the MRT-LBM are investigated in the
complex plane. Based on the sensitivity analysis and the recovered L-NSE, we
propose some simplified optimization strategies to determine the free
relaxation parameters in the MRT-LBM. Meanwhile, the dispersion and dissipation
relations of the optimal MRT-LBM are quantitatively compared with the exact
dispersion and dissipation relations. At last, some numerical validations on
classical acoustic benchmark problems are shown to assess the new optimal

learning relations from data is introduced here. It extends existing approaches
because both crisp and graded relations are considered, and it unifies existing

may proceed with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an intermediate. Recently
gas-phase H2O2 has been detected in {\rho} Oph A with an abundance of ~1E-10
relative to H2.
  Aims. We aim to reproduce the observed abundance of H2O2 and other species
detected in {\rho} Oph A quantitatively.
  Methods. We make use of a chemical network which includes gas phase reactions
as well as processes on the grains; desorption from the grain surface through
chemical reaction is also included. We run the model for a range of physical
parameters.
  Results. The abundance of H2O2 can be best reproduced at ~6E5 yr, which is
close to the dynamical age of {\rho} Oph A. The abundances of other species
such as H2CO, CH3OH, and O2 can be reasonably reproduced also at this time. In
the early time the gas-phase abundance of H2O2 can be much higher than the
current detected value. We predict a gas phase abundance of O2H at the same
order of magnitude as H2O2, and an abundance of the order 1E-8 for gas phase
water in {\rho} Oph A. A few other species of interest are also discussed.
  Conclusions. We demonstrate that H2O2 can be produced on the dust grains and
released into the gas phase through non-thermal desorption via surface
exothermic reactions. The H2O2 molecule on the grain is an important
intermediate in the formation of water. The fact that H2O2 is over-produced in
the gas phase for a range of physical conditions suggests that its destruction
channel in the current gas phase network may be incomplete.

In recent years, several linear methods have been developed to reconstruct the
density distribution in the Universe in three dimensions, making use of
photometric redshift information to determine the radial distribution of lensed
sources. In this paper, we aim to address three key issues seen in these
methods; namely, the bias in the redshifts of detected objects, the line of
sight smearing seen in reconstructions, and the damping of the amplitude of the
reconstruction relative to the underlying density. We consider the problem
under the framework of compressed sensing (CS). Under the assumption that the
data are sparse in an appropriate dictionary, we construct a robust estimator
and employ state-of-the-art convex optimisation methods to reconstruct the
density contrast. For simplicity in implementation, and as a proof of concept
of our method, we reduce the problem to one-dimension, considering the
reconstruction along each line of sight independently. Despite the loss of
information this implies, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately
reproduce cluster haloes up to a redshift of z=1, deeper than state-of-the-art
linear methods. We directly compare our method with these linear methods, and
demonstrate minimal radial smearing and redshift bias in our reconstructions,
as well as a reduced damping of the reconstruction amplitude as compared to the
linear methods. In addition, the CS framework allows us to consider an
underdetermined inverse problem, thereby allowing us to reconstruct the density
contrast at finer resolution than the input data.

explanation for these observations. However, the 10-20 days quasi-periodic
episodes of high levels of acoustic reflection, light and large vertical
currents continuing into the summer are not direct evidence of this process. It
is hypothesized that the main process allowing for suspended material to be
moved vertically later in the year is local advection, linked with topographic
boundary current instabilities along the rim of the 'Northern Current'.

discrete (Dirac) points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) and disperse linearly in all
directions around these critical points. Including spin, the low energy
effective theory around each critical point is a four band Dirac Hamiltonian.
In two dimensions (2D), this situation is realized in graphene without
spin-orbit coupling. 3D Dirac points are predicted to exist at the phase
transition between a topological and a normal insulator in the presence of
inversion symmetry. Here we show that 3D Dirac points can also be protected by
crystallographic symmetries in particular space-groups and enumerate the
criteria necessary to identify these groups. This reveals the possibility of 3D
analogs to graphene. We provide a systematic approach for identifying such
materials and present ab initio calculations of metastable \beta-cristobalite
BiO_2 which exhibits Dirac points at the three symmetry related X points of the
BZ.

X-ray and optical observations from the Swift X-Ray Telescope and the Swift
UltraViolet/Optical Telescope with ground-based optical and infrared data
obtained using the REM, ROTSE, and CTIO 1.3-m telescopes to construct a
detailed data set extending from 86 s to approximately 100,000 s after the BAT
trigger. Our data cover a wide energy range, from 10 keV to 0.77 eV (1.24 to
16,000 Angstrom). The X-ray afterglow shows a shallow initial decay followed by
a rapid decay starting at about 18,000 s. The optical and infrared afterglow,
however, shows an uncharacteristic rise at about 3000 s that does not
correspond to any feature in the X-ray light curve. Our data are not consistent
with synchrotron radiation from a jet interacting with an external medium, a
two-component jet, or continuous energy injection from the central engine. We
find that the optical light curves can be broadly explained by a collision
between two ejecta shells within a two-component jet. A growing number of
gamma-ray burst afterglows are consistent with complex jets, which suggests
that some (or all) gamma-ray burst jets are complex and will require detailed
modelling to fully understand them.

behavior of the Nd compound is interesting in some respects. This compound is
considered to order ferromagnetically (below 16 K), unlike other members of
this series which order antiferromagnetically. In addition, magnetic ordering
temperature (To) is significantly enhanced with respect to de Gennes scaled
value. In order to understand the magnetism of this compound better, we have
investigated the magnetic behavior in detail (under external pressure as well)
and also of its solid solutions based on substitutions at Nd and at Si sites,
viz., on the series, Nd(2-x)(Y,La)(x)PdSi(3-y)Ge(y) (x, y= 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and
1.2) by bulk measurements. The results overall establish that Nd2PdSi3 orders
ferromagnetically below 16 K, but antiferromagnetic component seems to set in
at very low temperatures. Notably, there is a significant suppression of To for
Y and Ge substitutions, compared to La substitution, for a given magnitude of
unit-cell volume change, however qualitatively correlating with the separation
between the layers of Nd and Pd-Si(Ge). On the basis of this observation, we
conclude that 4f(Nd) hybridization plays a major role on the magnetism of the
former solid solutions. To our knowledge, this work serves as a rare
demonstration of 4f-hybridization effects on the magnetism of a Nd-based
intermetallic compound.

have been reported previously: the primary one is associated with the contact
binary and the secondary one is an arc-like source $\sim 0\rlap.{""}8$ to the NE

of the contact binary and a B-type star in the region. In this paper we report
the detection of an extended ($\sim 30""$), non-thermal component to the NE of
the compact components. We propose that this extended emission could be an
unresolved background source (i. e. a radio galaxy), extended galactic
emission, or non-thermal emission related with relativistic electrons that are
produced in the shock between the contact binary and the B-type star and that
are carried away to large distances by the wind from the contact binary.

and study their applications to the approximation of set-valued functions.
Differently from previous works on set-valued approximation, our methods are
developed and analyzed in the metric space of Lebesgue measurable sets endowed
with the symmetric difference metric. The construction of the set-valued
subdivision schemes is based on a new weighted average of two sets, which is
defined for positive weights (corresponding to interpolation) and also when one
weight is negative (corresponding to extrapolation).
  Using the new average with positive weights, we adapt to sets spline
subdivision schemes computed by the Lane-Riesenfeld algorithm, which requires
only averages of pairs of numbers. The averages of numbers are then replaced by
the new averages of pairs of sets. Among other features of the resulting
set-valued subdivision schemes, we prove their monotonicity preservation
property. Using the new weighted average of sets with both positive and
negative weights, we adapt to sets the 4-point interpolatory subdivision
scheme. Finally we discuss the extension of the results obtained in the metric
spaces of sets, to general metric spaces endowed with an averaging operation
satisfying certain properties.

are preserved in its Cholesky decomposition, and vice versa, was addressed by
Paulsen et al. in the Journal of Functional Analysis (85, pp151-178). In
particular, they prove that for the pattern of zeros in $A$ to be retained in
the Cholesky decomposition of $A$, the pattern of zeros in $A$ has to
necessarily correspond to a chordal (or decomposable) graph associated with a
specific type of vertex ordering. This result therefore yields a
characterization of chordal graphs in terms of sparse positive definite
matrices. It has also proved to be extremely useful in probabilistic and
statistical analysis of Markov random fields where zeros in positive definite
correlation matrices are intimately related to the notion of stochastic
independence. Now, consider a positive definite matrix $A$ and its Cholesky
decomposition given by $A = LDL^T$, where $L$ is lower triangular with unit
diagonal entries, and $D$ a diagonal matrix with positive entries. In this
paper, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for zeros (i.e.,
sparsity) in a positive definite matrix $A$ to be preserved in its associated
Cholesky matrix $L$, \, and in addition also preserved in the inverse of the
Cholesky matrix $L^{-1}$, is that the pattern of zeros corresponds to a
co-chordal or homogeneous graph associated with a specific type of vertex
ordering. We proceed to provide a second characterization of this class of
graphs in terms of determinants of submatrices that correspond to cliques in
the graph. These results add to the growing body of literature in the field of
sparse matrix decompositions, and also prove to be critical ingredients in the
probabilistic analysis of an important class of Markov random fields.

Math. 70, pp. 1899-1921",,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mechanical properties of vertebrate bone are largely determined by a
process which involves the complex interplay of three different cell types.
This process is called {\it bone remodeling}, and occurs asynchronously at
multiple sites in the mature skeleton. The cells involved are bone resorbing
osteoclasts, bone matrix producing osteoblasts and mechanosensing osteocytes.
These cells communicate with each other by means of autocrine and paracrine
signaling factors and operate in complex entities, the so-called bone
multicellular units (BMU). To investigate the BMU dynamics in silico, we
develop a novel mathematical model resulting in a system of nonlinear partial
differential equations with time delays. The model describes the osteoblast and
osteoclast populations together with the dynamics of the key messenger molecule
RANKL and its decoy receptor OPG. Scaling theory is used to address parameter
sensitivity and predict the emergence of pathological remodeling regimes. The
model is studied numerically in one and two space dimensions using finite
difference schemes in space and explicit delay equation solvers in time. The
computational results are in agreement with in vivo observations and provide
new insights into the role of the RANKL/OPG pathway in the spatial regulation
of bone remodeling.
