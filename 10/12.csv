algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. First, we consider some
class of algebraic subgroups of $\mathcal C_n$ that we call flattenable. It
contains all tori. Linearizability of the natural rational actions of
flattenable subgroups on the affine space $\An$ is intimately related to
rationality of the invariant fields and, for tori, is equivalent to it. We
prove stable linearizability of these actions and show the existence of
nonlinearizable actions among them. This is applied to exploring maximal tori
in $\mathcal C_n$ and to proving the existence of nonlinearizable, but stably
linearizable elements of infinite order in $\mathcal C_n$ for $n\geqslant 6$.
Then we consider some subgroups $\mathcal J(x_1,..., x_n)$ of $\mathcal C_n$
that we call the rational de Jonqui\`eres subgroups. We prove that every affine
algebraic subgroup of $\mathcal J(x_1,..., x_n)$ is solvable and the group of
its connected components is Abelian. We also prove that every reductive
algebraic subgroup of $\mathcal J(x_1,..., x_n)$ is diagonalizable. Further, we
prove that the natural rational action on $\An$ of any unipotent algebraic
subgroup of $\mathcal J(x_1,..., x_n)$ admits a rational cross-section which is
an affine subspace of $\An$. We show that in this statement ""unipotent"" cannot
be replaced by ""connected solvable"".\;This is applied to proving a conjecture
of A. Joseph on the existence of ""rational slices"" for the coadjoint
representations of finite-dimensional algebraic Lie algebras $\mathfrak g$
under the assumption that the Levi decomposition of $\mathfrak g$ is a direct
product.

high-redshift, massive, star-forming galactic discs. To this aim, we integrate
in time the equations of mass and energy conservation under self-regulated
instability of a two-component disc of gas and stars. The disc is assumed to be
continuously fed by cold gas at the average cosmological rate. The gas forms
stars and is partly driven away by stellar feedback. The gas and stars flow
inward through the disc to a central bulge due to torques that drive angular
momentum outwards. The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down
the gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains
the disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the
dissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity
dispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and
cool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low
gas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s. We vary the
model parameters that characterize the accreted gas fraction, turbulence
dissipation rate, star-formation rate, and stellar feedback. We find that as
long as the gas input roughly follows the average cosmological rate, the disc
instability is a robust phenomenon at high redshift till z~1, driven by the
high surface density and high gas fraction due to the intense cosmological
accretion. For a broad range of model parameter values, the discs tend to
`stabilize' at z~0-0.5 as they become dominated by hot stars. When the model
parameters are pushed to extreme values, the discs may stabilize as early as
z~2, with the gas loss by strong outflows serving as the dominant stabilizing
factor.

spectrometric or gene expression profiles over time with only few time points
but a large number of measured variables. The analysis of such temporal
sequences is challenging and only few methods have been proposed. The
information can be encoded time independent, by means of classical expression
differences for a single time point or in expression profiles over time.
Available methods are limited to unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The
predictive variables can be identified only by means of wrapper or
post-processing techniques. This is complicated due to the small number of
samples for such studies. Here, we present a supervised learning approach,
termed Supervised Topographic Mapping Through Time (SGTM-TT). It learns a
supervised mapping of the temporal sequences onto a low dimensional grid. We
utilize a hidden markov model (HMM) to account for the time domain and
relevance learning to identify the relevant feature dimensions most predictive
over time. The learned mapping can be used to visualize the temporal sequences
and to predict the class of a new sequence. The relevance learning permits the
identification of discriminating masses or gen expressions and prunes
dimensions which are unnecessary for the classification task or encode mainly
noise. In this way we obtain a very efficient learning system for temporal
sequences. The results indicate that using simultaneous supervised learning and
metric adaptation significantly improves the prediction accuracy for
synthetically and real life data in comparison to the standard techniques. The
discriminating features, identified by relevance learning, compare favorably
with the results of alternative methods. Our method permits the visualization
of the data on a low dimensional grid, highlighting the observed temporal

construction in flat and curved backgrounds, their interpretation as BPS states
carrying (topological) charges in the supersymmetry algebra and the connection
between supersymmetry and hamiltonian BPS bounds. When available, I emphasise

Second, the use of probe approximations to infer about non-trivial dynamics of
strongly coupled gauge theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. This includes
expectation values of Wilson loop operators, spectrum information and the
general use of D-brane probes to approximate the dynamics of systems with small

partial results in covariantising these couplings to curved backgrounds, and
the more recent supersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theories describing

average separation as functions of temperature. The specific heat and average
separation between monopoles and antimonopoles exhibit a sharp peak and a local

monopoles increase logarithmically with the system size, indicating that
completely isolated charges could be found only at the thermodynamic limit. In
general, the results obtained here suggest that, for temperatures $T \geq

Gaifman theorem fails, in that there is an embedding $j:M\to N$ of ZFC- models
that is $\Sigma_1$-elementary and cofinal, but not elementary; there are
elementary embeddings $j:M\to N$ of ZFC- models whose cofinal restriction
$j:M\to \bigcup j``M$ is not elementary. Moreover, the collection of formulas

$ZFC^-$, obtained by using collection rather than replacement in the

present during solar flares and on properties of these ions when they interact
in the solar atmosphere. The production of {\gamma}-rays and neutrons results
from convolution of the nuclear cross-sections with the ion distribution
functions in the atmosphere. The observed {\gamma}-ray and neutron fluxes thus
provide useful diagnostics for the properties of energetic ions, yielding
strong constraints on acceleration mechanisms as well as properties of the
interaction sites. The problem of ion transport between the accelerating and
interaction sites must also be addressed to infer as much information as
possible on the properties of the primary ion accelerator. In the last couple
of decades, both theoretical and observational developments have led to
substantial progress in understanding the origin of solar {\gamma}-rays and
neutrons. This chapter reviews recent developments in the study of solar
{\gamma}-rays and of solar neutrons at the time of the RHESSI era. The
unprecedented quality of the RHESSI data reveals {\gamma}-ray line shapes for
the first time and provides {\gamma}-ray images. Our previous understanding of
the properties of energetic ions based on measurements from the former solar
cycles is also summarized. The new results-obtained owing both to the gain in
spectral resolution (both with RHESSI and with the non solar-dedicated
INTEGRAL/SPI instrument) and to the pioneering imaging technique in the
{\gamma}-ray domain-are presented in the context of this previous knowledge.
Still open questions are emphasized in the last section of the chapter and
future perspectives on this field are briefly discussed.

providing a practical and objective characterization of sparse models by means
of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle -- a well established
information-theoretic approach to model selection in statistical inference. The
resulting framework derives a family of efficient sparse coding and dictionary
learning algorithms which, by virtue of the MDL principle, are completely

prior information to existing models, such as Markovian dependencies, or to
define completely new problem formulations, including in the matrix analysis

applications of approximation theory, probability and statistics. In
particular, identifying strictly positive definite kernels is of great interest
as interpolation problems corresponding to these kernels are guaranteed to be
poised. A Bochner type result of Schoenberg characterises continuous positive
definite zonal functions, $f(\cos \cdot)$, on the sphere $\Sdmone$, as those
with nonnegative Gegenbauer coefficients. More recent results characterise
strictly positive definite functions on $\Sdmone$ by stronger conditions on the
signs of the Gegenbauer coefficients. Unfortunately, given a function $f$,
checking the signs of all the Gegenbauer coefficients can be an onerous, or
impossible, task. Therefore, it is natural to seek simpler sufficient
conditions which guarantee (strict) positive definiteness. We state a
conjecture which leads to a P\'olya type criterion for functions to be
(strictly) positive definite on the sphere $\Sdmone$. In analogy to the case of
the Euclidean space, the conjecture claims positivity of a certain integral

0.8446 micron line of O I) along with continuum measurements made near the
standard J, H, K, and L photometric bands were measured. A mass accretion rate
of approximately 2 x 10^-8 solar masses per year was derived from the Br gamma
and Pa beta lines. However, the fluxes of these lines varied by a factor of
over two during the course of a few months. The continuum also varied, but by
only ~30%, and even decreased at a time when the gas emission was increasing.
The H I line at 1.083 microns was also found to vary in a manner inconsistent
with that of either the hydrogen lines or the dust. Both the gas and dust
variabilities indicate significant changes in the region of the inner gas and
the inner dust belt that may be common to many young disk systems. If planets
are responsible for defining the inner edge of the gap, they could interact
with the material on time scales commensurate with what is observed for the
variations in the dust, while other disk instabilities (thermal,
magnetorotational) would operate there on longer time scales than we observe
for the inner dust belt. For SAO 206462, the orbital period would likely be 1-3
years. If the changes are being induced in the disk material closer to the star
than the gap, a variety of mechanisms (disk instabilities, interactions via
planets) might be responsible for the changes seen. The He I feature is most
likely due to a wind whose orientation changes with respect to the observer on
time scales of a day or less. To further constrain the origin of the gas and
dust emission will require multiple spectroscopic and interferometric
observations on both shorter and longer time scales that have been sampled so
far.

matter can grow both on superhorizon and subhorizon scales, and these
non-adiabatic perturbations on subhorizon scales can lead to instability in
this dark energy model. The rapidly growing non-adiabatic modes on subhorizon
scales always occur when the equation of state parameter of dark energy starts
to drop towards -1 near the end of matter era, except that the parameter
\alpha\ of Ricci dark energy equals to 1/2. In the case where \alpha\ = 1/2,
the rapidly growing non-adiabatic modes disappear when the perturbations in
dark energy and matter are adiabatic initially. However, an adiabaticity
between dark energy and matter perturbations at early time implies a
non-adiabaticity between matter and radiation, this can influence the ordinary
Sachs-Wolfe (OSW) effect. Since the amount of Ricci dark energy is not small
during matter domination, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is greatly
modified by density perturbations of dark energy, leading to a wrong shape of

the XY chain and the transverse field Ising chain at criticality, it is shown
that the ground state of an open system with SSD is identical to that of a

requirement that $E\circ$ has vanishing Nijenhuis torsion. Moreover, after
having defined new equivalence relations for connections compatible with
respect to the $F$-product $\circ$, namely hydrodynamically almost equivalent
and hydrodynamically equivalent connections, we show how these two concepts
manifest themselves in several specific situations. In particular, in the case
of an $F$-manifold endowed with eventual identity and two almost
hydrodynamically equivalent flat connections we are able to derive the
recurrence relations for the flows of the associated integrable hierarchy. If
the two connections originate from a flat pencil of metrics these reduce to the
standard bi-Hamiltonian recursion. Furthermore, using the geometric set-up
proposed here we show how the recurrence relations of the principal hierarchy
introduced by Dubrovin arise in this general framework and we provide a general
cohomological set-up for the conservation laws of the semihamiltonian hierarchy
associated to a semisimple $F$-manifold with compatible connection and eventual
identity. Therefore, the point of view we propose, not only highlight the
conceptual unity of two well-known recursive schemes (principal hierarchy and
classical bi-Hamiltonian) but it also provides a far reaching generalization of
these recursions that relies on the presence of an eventual identity.

localization and ferromagnetic spin states are found to be largely attenuated
owing to the adsorption of Pd clusters. The potential energy surfaces of the Pd

tend to sinter into larger clusters, whereas the Pd dimer, trimer and tetramer

to what extent selected closed-shell nuclei in the oxygen and calcium isotopic
chains can effectively be mapped onto an effective independent-particle
picture. To do so, we revisit in detail the notion of ESPEs in the context of
strongly correlated many-nucleon systems and illustrate the necessity to
extract ESPEs through the diagonalization of the centroid {\it matrix}, as
originally argued by Baranger. For the purpose of illustration, we analyse the
impact of correlations on observable one-nucleon separation energies and
non-observable ESPEs in selected closed-shell oxygen and calcium isotopes. We
then state and illustrate the non-observability of ESPEs. Similarly to
spectroscopic factors, ESPEs can indeed be modified by a redefinition of
inaccessible quantities while leaving actual observables unchanged. This leads
to the absolute necessity to employ consistent structure and reaction models
based on the same nuclear Hamiltonian to extract the shell structure in a
meaningful fashion from experimental data.

minihalos (UCMHs) of dark matter are expected to be produced in much greater
abundance than, e.g., primordial black holes. Forming shortly after
matter-radiation equality, these objects would develop very dense and spiky
dark matter profiles. In the standard scenario where dark matter consists of
thermally-produced, weakly-interacting massive particles, UCMHs could thus
appear as highly luminous gamma-ray sources, or leave an imprint in the cosmic
microwave background by changing the reionisation history of the Universe. We
derive corresponding limits on the cosmic abundance of UCMHs at different
epochs, and translate them into constraints on the primordial power spectrum.
We find the resulting constraints to be quite severe, especially at length
scales much smaller than what can be directly probed by the cosmic microwave
background or large-scale structure observations. We use our results to provide
an updated compilation of the best available constraints on the power of
density fluctuations on all scales, ranging from the present-day horizon to
scales more than 20 orders of magnitude smaller.

decoupled transmission factors from an S-matrix and compute them for various

between transverse modes, in D=4, and excites the longitudinal modes, in
particular the s-wave. Moreover, it increases the contribution of waves with
larger angular momentum, which can be dominant at intermediate energies. The
transmission factors are then used to obtain the Hawking fluxes in this

coordinates of tens of thousands of individual stars, making it possible to
compute their 3-dimensional orbits. Spectral analysis of large numbers of halo
orbits can be used to construct frequency maps which are a compact, yet
informative representation of their phase space distribution function (DF).
Such maps can be used to infer the major types of orbit families that
constitute the DF of stellar halo and their relative abundances. The structure
of the frequency maps, especially the resonant orbits, reflects the formation
history and shape of the dark matter potential and its orientation relative to
the disk. The application of frequency analysis to cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations of disk galaxies shows that the orbital families occupied by halo
stars and dark matter particles are very similar, implying that stellar halo
orbits can be used to constrain the DF of the dark matter halo, possibly
impacting future direct dark matter detection experiments. An application of
these methods to a sample of \sim 16,000 Milky Way halo and thick disk stars
from the SDSS-SEGUE survey yields a frequency map with strong evidence for
resonant trapping of halo stars by the Milky Way disk, in a manner predicted by
controlled simulations in which the disk grows adiabatically. The application
of frequency analysis methods to current and future phase space data for Milky
Way halo stars will provide new insights into the formation history of the

2 (SGMC 2). We find extended H2 line emission across much of the 600 pc

a compact H2 source with broad lines and a dynamical mass Mdyn 10^7 Msun, which
has no observable Brg or K-band continuum emission, and no obvious counterpart
in the 6 cm radio continuum. Line ratios indicate that the H2 emission of both
sources is powered by shocks, making these lines a quantitative tracer of the
dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. The turbulence appears to be driven by
the large-scale gas dynamics, and not by feedback from star formation. We
propose a scenario where the H2 emission is related to the formation of bound
clouds through accretion. The kinetic energy of the accreted gas drives the
turbulence and powers the H2 emission. Broad H2 line widths of-order 150 km/s,
similar to the velocity gradient of the gas across the field of view, support
this idea. Within this interpretation, the compact H2 source could be a massive
cloud on its way to form a super star cluster within the next few Myr. This
scenario can be further tested with ALMA observations.

extending radially outwards from the ansae. Using a simple disk model with a
power-law surface brightness profile, we demonstrate that the observed
streamers can be understood as part of the smoothly tapered outer boundary of
the debris disk, which is most visible at the ansae. Our observations are
consistent with the expected result of a narrow planetesimal ring being ground
up in a collisional cascade, yielding dust with a wide range of grain sizes.
Radiation forces leave large grains in the ring and push smaller grains onto
elliptical, or even hyperbolic trajectories. We measure and characterize the
disk's surface brightness profile, and confirm the previously suspected offset
of the disk's center from the star's position along the ring's major axis.
Furthermore, we present first evidence for an offset along the minor axis. Such
offsets are commonly viewed as signposts for the presence of unseen planets
within a disk's cavity. Our images also offer new constraints on the presence
of companions down to the planetary mass regime (~9 Jupiter masses at 0.5"", ~3

and rotation in the Weyl space-time. In particular we consider the Starobinsky
modification, $f(R)=R+\beta R^2-2\Lambda$, of gravity in the Einstein-Palatini
formalism, which turns out to reduce to the Weyl integrable space-time (WIST)
with the Weyl vector being a gradient. The modified Raychaudhuri equation takes
the form of the Hill-type equation which is then analysed for studying
formation of the caustics. In this model, it is possible to have a Big Bang
singularity free cyclic Universe but unfortunately the periodicity turns out to
be extremely short.

these problems is determined by the inverse spectral gap of H for that

spectral gap amplification is to construct a Hamiltonian H' with the same
eigenstate as H but a bigger spectral gap, requiring that constant-time
evolutions with H' and H are implemented with nearly the same cost. We show
that a quadratic spectral gap amplification is possible when H satisfies a
frustration-free property and give H' for these cases. This results in quantum
speedups for optimization problems. It also yields improved constructions for
adiabatic simulations of quantum circuits and for the preparation of projected
entangled pair states (PEPS), which play an important role in quantum many-body
physics. Defining a suitable black-box model, we establish that the quadratic
amplification is optimal for frustration-free Hamiltonians and that no spectral
gap amplification is possible, in general, if the frustration-free property is
removed. A corollary is that finding a similarity transformation between a
stoquastic Hamiltonian and the corresponding stochastic matrix is hard in the
black-box model, setting limits to the power of some classical methods that

SGR-like bursts with such a low magnetic field? What powers the observed X-ray
emission when neither the rotational energy nor the magnetic dipole energy are
sufficient? These observations, that suggest either a much larger energy
reservoir or a much younger true age (or both), have renewed the interest in
the evolutionary sequence of magnetars. We examine, here, a phenomenological
model for the magnetic field decay: B_dip} \propto (B_dip)^{1+a} and compare
its predictions with the observed period, P,the period derivative, \dot{P}, and
the X-ray luminosity, L_X, of magnetar candidates. We find a strong evidence
for a dipole field decay on a timescale of \sim 10^3 yr for the strongest (\sim
10^{15} G) field objects, with a decay index within the range 1 \leq a < 2 and
more likely within 1.5\lesssim a \lesssim 1.8. The decaying field implies a
younger age than what is implied by the spinown age. Surprisingly, even with
the younger age, the energy released in the dipole field decay is insufficient
to power the X-ray emission, suggesting the existence of a stronger internal
field, B_int. Examining several models for the internal magnetic field decay we
find that it must have a very large (> 10^{16} G) initial value. Our findings
suggest two clear distinct evolutionary tracks -- the SGR/AXP branch and the

optical properties of surfaces of atmosphereless rocky bodies under exposure to
the space environment. The general agreement about the relevance of the effects
of space weathering on the spectral properties of S-complex asteroids fails
when some basic quantitative estimates are attempted. In particular, there is
severe disagreement regarding the typical timescales for significant spectral
reddening to occur, ranging from 1 Myr to 1 Gyr. Generally speaking, the
spectral reddening of an individual object can be considered as the sum of
three terms, one (which is relevant for statistical analyses) depending on the
exposure of the object to space weathering during its lifetime, a second one
due to the original surface composition, and a third one (a ""noise"" term) due
to the combination of poorly constrained effects (e.g., structure and texture
of the surface). The surface of an asteroid is usually covered by regolith, and
its presence and properties presumably play a critical role in the weathering
processes. In this paper we discuss the role played by collisional evolution in
affecting the spectral properties of asteroids and refreshing the surfaces due
to the formation of ejecta, and the necessity of a simultaneous modeling of
collisions and weathering processes. We introduce a new idea, based on the
possibility of a sort of saturation of the refreshing process whenever a
massive reaccumulation of the impact ejecta takes place. In this case, a
dependence of the overall reddening on the asteroid size should naturally come
out. We show that this conclusion is indeed supported by available main belt
asteroid spectroscopic data.

with cyclic vehicle loadings and pavement temperature distribution were
implemented in a series of FE models in order to study the evolution of
horizontal tensile and shear strains at the bottom of the HMA overlay. The
effect of several design parameters, such as subbase and subgrade moduli,
vehicle speed, overlay thickness, and temperature condition, on the horizontal
and shear strain response was investigated. Results obtained show that the rate
of horizontal and shear strain increase at the bottom of the HMA overlay drop
with higher vehicle speed, higher subgrade modulus, and higher subbase modulus.
Moreover, the rate of horizontal strain accumulation increases with higher
overlay thickness. Although initial strain values were higher at positive
pavement temperature distributions, the corresponding rate of strain increase
were higher at negative pavement temperatures. Finally, an extrapolation of the
strain history curve for various pavement design parameters was used to
estimate the number of cycles for bottom-up crack initiation.

the former and inverse power law for the latter. Moreover, the model functions
often have different dimensionality, e.g. the chromospheric distribution may
depend solely on solar altitude, while the coronal number density may be a
function of both altitude and latitude. For applications which need to consider
both chromospheric and coronal models, the chromosphere-corona boundary, where
these functions have different values as well as gradients, can lead to
numerical problems. We encountered this problem in context of ray tracing
through the corona at low radio frequencies, as a part of effort to prepare for
the analysis of solar images from new generation radio arrays like the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and Long

patch function is independent of the stitched functions dimensionalities. It
always has eight parameters (even four for univariate functions) and they may
be found without linear system solution for every point. The developed method

modeling pipeline is made of two main steps: the first one is to assess its
shape on stars, and the second is to interpolate it at any desired position

interpolation schemes, including polynomial interpolation, radial basis

simulations of PSF fields, in which stars are built from a set of basis

significantly better than the traditionally used polynomial interpolation. We

more elaborate techniques will have to be developed to reach future ambitious
surveys' requirements.

biodiversity conservation. For this reason, food web response to species loss
has been investigated in several ways in the last years. Several studies
focused on secondary extinction due to biodiversity loss in a bottom-up
perspective using in-silico extinction experiments in which a single species is
removed at each step and the number of secondary extinctions is recorded. In
these binary simulations a species goes secondarily extinct if it loses all its
resource species, that is, when the energy intake is zero. This pure
topological statement represents the best case scenario. In fact a consumer
species could go extinct losing a certain fraction of the energy intake and the
response of quantitative food webs to node loss could be very different with
respect to simple binary predictions. The goal of this paper is to analyze how
patterns of secondary extinctions change when higher species sensitivity are
included in the analyses. In particular, we explored how food web secondary
extinction, triggered by the removal of most connected nodes, varies as a
function of the energy intake threshold assumed as the minimum needed for
species persistence. As we will show, a very low increase of energy intake
threshold stimulates a disproportionate growth of secondary extinction.

space exploration settings.
  The study participants received 24 sets of one to eight integer values
between 0 and 127, which they had to match by making adjustments with physical
or graphical sliders. Based on recorded slider motion path data, we developed
an analysis algorithm that identifies and measures different types of activity
intervals, including error time moving irrelevant sliders and end time in
breaks after completing each trial item. Our results showed a significant
increase in speed of the mixing board interaction accompanied by reduced
perceived cognitive load when compared with the traditional mouse-based GUI
interaction. The gains in speed are largely due to the improved times required
for the hand to reach for the first slider (acquisition time) and also when
moving between different ones, while the actual time spent manipulating
relevant sliders is very similar for either input device. These results agree
strongly with qualitative predictions from Fitts' Law that the larger targets
afforded by the mixer handles contributed to its faster performance. For
further investigation, we computed a measure of motion simultaneity based on
velocity correlation, which allowed to identify types of items for which
increased simultaneous adjustments occur.
  For continuous parameter space exploration our findings suggest that mixing
boards are a good option to provide detailed multi-value control. The strengths
of this input method particularly show in settings where screen space is
precious and undisrupted visual focus is crucial.

frequency waves that have been observed in models forced by zonally symmetric
boundary conditions. Using the Hayashi spectral analysis of the extratropical
waves, we find that a quasi-stationary (QS) wave five belongs to a wave packet
obeying a well defined dispersion relation with eastward group velocity. The
components of the dispersion relation with k>5 baroclinically convert eddy
available potential energy into eddy kinetic energy, while those with k<5 are
baroclinically neutral. In agreement with the Green's model of baroclinic
instability, the wave five is weakly unstable, and the inverse energy cascade,
which had been previously proposed as a main forcing for this type of waves,
only acts as a positive feedback on its predominantly baroclinic energetics.
The QS wave is reinforced by a phase lock to an analogous pattern in the
tropical convection, which provides further amplification to the wave. We also
find that the Pedlosky bounds on the phase speed of unstable waves provide
guidance in explaining the latitudinal structure of the energy conversion,
which is shown to be more enhanced where the zonal westerly surface wind is
weaker. The wave energy is then trapped in the wave guide created by the upper
tropospheric jet stream. In agreement with Green's theory, as the equator to
pole SST difference is reduced the stationary marginally stable component
shifts toward higher wavenumbers, while the wave five becomes neutral and
westward propagating. Some properties of the aquaplanet QS waves are found in
interesting agreement with a low frequency wave observed by Salby (1982) in the
southern hemisphere DJF, so that this perspective on low frequency variability
might be, apart from its value in terms of basic geophysical fluid dynamics, of
specific interest for studying the Earth's atmosphere.

stable configuration with tachyon content must be covered with a non-tachyon
envelope. The boundary between the tachyon core and the envelope is determined
by the critical pressure $P_T$, which depends on the tachyon mass $m$. The
tachyon core is dominant and its mass can exceed many times the solar mass
$M_{\odot}$ when $m$ is much smaller than the nucleon mass $m_p$, while at
large $m$ compared with $m_p$, the main contribution to the total stellar mass

observations of a physical system into an underlying model in order to infer
the properties of the state of the system. Filters refer to a class of data
assimilation algorithms designed to update the estimation of the state in a
on-line fashion, as data is acquired sequentially. For linear problems subject
to Gaussian noise filtering can be performed exactly using the Kalman filter.
For nonlinear systems it can be approximated in a systematic way by particle
filters. However in high dimensions these particle filtering methods can break
down. Hence, for the large nonlinear systems arising in applications such as
weather forecasting, various ad hoc filters are used, mostly based on making
Gaussian approximations. The purpose of this work is to study the properties of
these ad hoc filters, working in the context of the 2D incompressible
Navier-Stokes equation. By working in this infinite dimensional setting we
provide an analysis which is useful for understanding high dimensional
filtering, and is robust to mesh-refinement. We describe theoretical results
showing that, in the small observational noise limit, the filters can be tuned
to accurately track the signal itself (filter stability), provided the system
is observed in a sufficiently large low dimensional space; roughly speaking
this space should be large enough to contain the unstable modes of the
linearized dynamics. Numerical results are given which illustrate the theory.
In a simplified scenario we also derive, and study numerically, a stochastic
PDE which determines filter stability in the limit of frequent observations,
subject to large observational noise. The positive results herein concerning
filter stability complement recent numerical studies which demonstrate that the
ad hoc filters perform poorly in reproducing statistical variation about the
true signal.

spiral galaxies is important for understanding their formation and evolution.
The combination of a galaxy rotation curve and strong lensing is a powerful way
to break the disk-halo degeneracy that is inherent in each of the methods
individually. We present an analysis of the 10-image radio spiral lens
B1933+503 at z_l=0.755, incorporating (1) new global VLBI observations, (2) new
adaptive-optics assisted K-band imaging, (3) new spectroscopic observations for
the lens galaxy rotation curve and the source redshift. We construct a
three-dimensionally axisymmetric mass distribution with 3 components: an
exponential profile for the disk, a point mass for the bulge, and an NFW
profile for the halo. The mass model is simultaneously fitted to the kinematics
and the lensing data. The NFW halo needs to be oblate with a flattening of
a/c=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.05} to be consistent with the radio data. This suggests
that baryons are effective at making the halos oblate near the center. The
lensing and kinematics analysis probe the inner ~10 kpc of the galaxy, and we
obtain a lower limit on the halo scale radius of 16 kpc (95% CI). The dark
matter mass fraction inside a sphere with a radius of 2.2 disk scale lengths is
f_{DM,2.2}=0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}. The contribution of the disk to the total
circular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths is 0.76^{+0.05}_{-0.06}, suggesting
that the disk is marginally submaximal. The stellar mass of the disk from our
modeling is log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{sun}) = 11.06^{+0.09}_{-0.11} assuming that the
cold gas contributes ~20% to the total disk mass. In comparison to the stellar
masses estimated from stellar population synthesis models, the stellar initial
mass function of Chabrier is preferred to that of Salpeter by a probability
factor of 7.2.

light curves for comparison with observations of other SNe Ia at low and high

the time evolution of the early UV flux to be well fit by the superposition of
two parabolic curves. Finally, we use the early UV flux measurements to examine
a possible shock interaction with a non-degenerate companion. From models

detailed re-analysis of all eclipse timing data available for the HU Aquarii
system, making use of standard techniques used to fit orbits to radial-velocity
data. We find that the eclipse timings can be used to obtain a two-planet
solution that does not require the presence of additional bodies within the

planetary system. We show that the improved orbital parameters we have derived
correspond to planets that are dynamically unstable on unfeasibly short
timescales (of order 10^4 years or less). Given these results, we discuss
briefly how the observed signal might in fact be the result of the intrinsic
properties of the eclipsing polar, rather than being evidence of dynamically
improbable planets. Taken in concert, our results highlight the need for
caution in interpreting such timing variations as being planetary in nature.

achieve scalable distribution of entanglement over long distances. However, the
probabilistic nature of entanglement generation and realistic quantum memory
storage times make the implementation of quantum repeaters an outstanding
experimental challenge. We propose a quantum repeater protocol based on the
deterministic storage of a single photon in atomic ensembles confined in
distant high-finesse cavities and show that this system is capable of
distributing the entanglement over long distances with a much higher rate as
compared to previous protocols, thereby alleviating the limitations on the
quantum memory lifetime by several orders of magnitude. Our scheme is robust
with respect to phase fluctuations in the quantum channel, while the fidelity
imperfection is fixed and negligibly small at each step of entanglement
swapping.

in sunspots appear in the form of repetitive trains of the duration 8-20 min

oscillation trains are transient in frequency and power. We detected a
repetitive frequency drifts of 3-min oscillations during the development of
individual trains. Wavelet analysis shows three types of the frequency drift:
positive, negative and fluctuations without drift. The start and end of the
drifts coincide with the start time and end of the train. The comparative study
of 3-min oscillations in the sequences of microwave and EUV images show the
appearance of new sources of the oscillations in sunspots during the

that channel upward propagating waves, responsible for 3-min oscillations. A
possible explanation of the observed properties is the operation of two
simultaneous factors: dispersive evolution of the upwardly-propagating wave
pulses and the non-uniformity of the distribution of the oscillation power over
the sunspot umbra with different wave sources corresponding to different

memory devices as well as impulse noise in transmission lines. Modeling rank
modulation involves construction of packings of the space of permutations
equipped with the Kendall tau distance.
  We present several general constructions of codes in permutations that cover
a broad range of code parameters. In particular, we show a number of ways in
which conventional error-correcting codes can be modified to correct errors in
the Kendall space. Codes that we construct afford simple encoding and decoding
algorithms of essentially the same complexity as required to correct errors in
the Hamming metric. For instance, from binary BCH codes we obtain codes
correcting $t$ Kendall errors in $n$ memory cells that support the order of
$n!/(\log_2n!)^t$ messages, for any constant $t= 1,2,...$ We also construct
families of codes that correct a number of errors that grows with $n$ at
varying rates, from $\Theta(n)$ to $\Theta(n^{2})$. One of our constructions
gives rise to a family of rank modulation codes for which the trade-off between
the number of messages and the number of correctable Kendall errors approaches
the optimal scaling rate. Finally, we list a number of possibilities for
constructing codes of finite length, and give examples of rank modulation codes
with specific parameters.

initially infected nodes can be ranked according to some measure of their
epidemic impact. The highest ranked nodes, also referred to as
""superspreaders"", are associated to dominant epidemic risks and therefore
deserve special attention. In simulations on studied empirical complex
networks, it is shown that the ranking depends on the dynamical regime of the
disease spreading. A possible mechanism leading to this dependence is
illustrated in an analytically tractable example. In systems where the
allocation of resources to counter disease spreading to individual nodes is
based on their ranking, the dynamical regime of disease spreading is frequently
not known before the outbreak of the disease. Therefore, we introduce a
quantity called epidemic centrality as an average over all relevant regimes of
disease spreading as a basis of the ranking. A recently introduced concept of
phase diagram of epidemic spreading is used as a framework in which several
types of averaging are studied. The epidemic centrality is compared to
structural properties of nodes such as node degree, k-cores and betweenness.
There is a growing trend of epidemic centrality with degree and k-cores values,
but the variation of epidemic centrality is much smaller than the variation of
degree or k-cores value. It is found that the epidemic centrality of the
structurally peripheral nodes is of the same order of magnitude as the epidemic
centrality of the structurally central nodes. The implications of these
findings for the distributions of resources to counter disease spreading are
discussed.

scales (i.e. from $\sim$ milliseconds to $\sim$ nanoseconds), known as {\it
fast transients}, the detections of which involve considerable signal
processing and data management challenges, given the high time and frequency
resolutions required in their explorations, the role of propagation effects to
be considered and a multitude of deleterious effects due to radio frequency

way, both through scientific discoveries enabled by the ongoing large-scale
surveys at Parkes and Arecibo, as well as technical developments involving the
exploratory use of multi-element array instruments such as VLBA and GMRT. Such
developments will undoubtedly provide valuable inputs as next-generation arrays
such as LOFAR and ASKAP are designed and commissioned. With their wider fields
of view and higher sensitivities, these instruments, and eventually the SKA,
hold great potential to revolutionise this relatively nascent field, thereby

staggered fermions on the MILC asqtad lattices.
  Our main focus is on the continuum extrapolation, which is done using (up to)
four different lattice spacings---$a\approx$ 0.12, 0.09, 0.06 and 0.045 fm.
Since Lattice 2010, we have reduced the statistical errors on the $a\approx
0.09\;$fm lattices by a factor of $\sim 3$, and roughly doubled the size of the
$a\approx0.045\;$fm ensemble.
  We find that these improvements have a very significant impact on the
continuum extrapolation, with the $a\approx 0.12\;$fm data lying outside the
range of applicability of simple functional forms. Hence we use only the three
smallest lattice spacings to perform the extrapolation, finding $\hat{B}_K =
B_K(\text{RGI}) = 0.725 \pm 0.004(\text{stat}) \pm 0.038(\text{sys}) $. This
value is consistent with our published value from 2010 (based the three
coarsest lattice spacings), but has smaller errors.

the tachocline. The X-ray photons in a helioscope pipe obtained from
back-conversion of the chameleons created inside the sun have a spectrum which
is peaked in the sub-keV region, just below the actual sensitivity range of the
present axion helioscopes. Nevertheless they are detectable by present day
magnetic helioscopes like CAST and Sumico, which were built originally for
solar axions. We also propose a chameleon-through-a-wall experiment whereby
X-ray photons from a synchroton radiation source could be converted into
chameleons inside a dipole magnet, then pass a wall which is opaque to X-rays
before being back-converted into X-ray photons in a second magnet downstream.

Blind Source Separation (BSS) from a linear mixture is only possible up to

latest technologies to be used in future wireless mobile communication
networks. However keeping in view the general poor masses of India, some of the
future generation technologies will be embedded with 2G and 2.5G so that
general masses may get the advantage of internet, multimedia services and the
operators may get proper revenues with little extra expenditure in the existing

fascinating physical properties. They provide an excellent model system for the
study of one dimensional materials and molecular electronics. The chirality of
nanotubes can lead to very different electronic behaviours, either metallic or
semiconducting. Their electronic spectrum consists of a series of Van Hove
singularities defining a bandgap for semiconducting tubes and molecular
orbitals at the corresponding energies. A promising way to tune the nanotubes
electronic properties for future applications is to use doping by heteroatoms.
Here we report on experimental investigation of the role of many-body
interactions in nanotube bandgaps, the visualization in direct space of the
molecular orbitals of nanotubes and the properties of nitrogen doped nanotubes
using scanning tunneling microscopy and transmission electron microscopy as
well as electron energy loss spectroscopy.

surprisingly raised the superconducting transition temperature Tc to the record
high 55 K in these materials4,5. However, Tc always goes down after passing
through a maximum at some pressure and the superconductivity eventually tends
to disappear at sufficiently high pressures1-3. Here we show that the
superconductivity can reemerge with a much higher Tc after its destruction upon
compression from the ambient-condition value of around 31 K in newly discovered
iron chalcogenide superconductors. We find that in the second superconducting
phase the maximum Tc is as high as 48.7 K for K0.8Fe1.70Se2 and 48 K for

to be related to pressure-induced quantum criticality. Our findings point to
the potential route to the further achievement of high-Tc superconductivity in

(EMRI) binary system formed by a star orbiting a massive black hole. The
ultimate goal is to detect the mass and spin of the black hole and provide a
test of general relativity in the strong-field regime from the resultant
quasi-periodic signals. Before accretion starts, the stellar orbit is presumed
to be circular and equatorial, and shrinks due to gravitational radiation. New
fitting formulae are presented for the inspiral time and the radiation-reaction
torque in the relativistic regime. If the inspiralling star fills its Roche
lobe outside the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) of the hole, gas will
flow through the inner Lagrange point (L1) to the hole. We give new
relativistic interpolation formulae for the volume enclosed by the Roche lobe.
If this mass-transfer happens on a time scale faster than the thermal time
scale but slower than the dynamical time scale, the star will evolve
adiabatically, and, in most cases, will recede from the hole while filling its
Roche lobe. We calculate how the stellar orbital period and mass-transfer rate
will change through the ""Roche evolution"" for various types of stars in the
relativistic regime. We envisage that the mass stream eventually hits the
accretion disc, where it forms a hot spot orbiting the hole and may ultimately
modulate the luminosity with the stellar orbital frequency. The observability
of such a modulation is discussed along with a possible interpretation of an
intermittent 1 hour period in the X-ray emission of RE J1034+396.

effective action in the decoupling limit contains an infinite number of terms,
once the vector degrees of freedom are included. These can be re-summed in
physically interesting situations, which result in non-polynomial couplings
between the scalar and vector modes. We show there are self-accelerating
background solutions for this effective action, with the possibility of having
a non-trivial profile for the vector fields. We then study fluctuations around
these solutions and show that there is always a ghost, if a background vector
field is present. When the background vector field is switched off, the ghost
can be avoided, at the price of entering into a strong coupling regime, in
which the vector fluctuations have vanishing kinetic terms. Finally we show
that the inclusion of a bare cosmological constant does not change the previous

anisotropic thermal expansion has been a potential disadvantage of this

mixture of different types of chopped, short carbon-fiber, in which one of the
important aims of the development was to reduce the anisotropy. The
measurements indicate that the anisotropy was much reduced down to 4% as a
result of hybridization. The thermal expansion data obtained are presented as
functions of temperature using eighth-order polynomials separately for the
horizontal (XY-) and vertical (Z-) directions of the fabrication process. The
average CTEs and their dispersion (1{\sigma}) in the range 293-10K derived from
the data for the XY- and Z-directions were 0.805$\pm$0.003\times10$^{-6}$

accuracy and the reproducibility of the present measurements are suggested to
be better than 0.01\times10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$ and 0.001\times(10)^{-6} K^{-1},

with our previous speculation regarding carbon-fiber, in which the residual
anisotropy tended to lie mainly in the horizontal plane.

following two different rates: 0.05 T/100$^{\circ}$C below 550$^{\circ}$C and
0.8 T/100$^{\circ}$C above. By making careful structural characterizations

conclude that perpendicular anisotropy observed in Co/Pt bilayers grown on

the well-known Schwinger mechanism, whose key dynamical ingredient is the
nonperturbative formation of longitudinally coupled massless bound-state
excitations. These excitations introduce poles in the vertices of the theory,
in such a way as to maintain the Slavnov-Taylor identities intact in the
presence of massive gluon propagators. In the present work we first focus on
the modifications induced to the nonperturbative three-gluon vertex by the
inclusion of massless two-gluon bound-states into the kernels appearing in its
skeleton-expansion. Certain general relations between the basic building blocks
of these bound-states and the gluon mass are then obtained from the
Slavnov-Taylor identities and the Schwinger-Dyson equation governing the gluon
propagator. The homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation determining the
wave-function of the aforementioned bound state is then derived, under certain
simplifying assumptions. It is then shown, through a detailed analytical and
numerical study, that this equation admits non-trivial solutions, indicating
that the QCD dynamics support indeed the formation of such massless bound
states. These solutions are subsequently used, in conjunction with the
aforementioned relations, to determine the momentum-dependence of the dynamical
gluon mass. Finally, further possibilities and open questions are briefly
discussed.

uni-directional (irreversible) mutations and selection at the expanding front.
While the evolutionary dynamics leads to coalescence of both wild-type and
mutant clusters, the non-homogeneous advance of the colony results in a rough
front. We show that roughening and domain dynamics are strongly coupled,
resulting in qualitatively altered bulk and front properties. For beneficial
mutations the front is quickly taken over by mutants and growth proceeds
Eden-like. In contrast, if mutants grow slower than wild-types, there is an
antagonism between selection pressure against mutants and growth by merging of
mutant domains with an ensuing absorbing state phase transition to an
all-mutant front. We find that surface roughening has a marked effect on the
critical properties of the absorbing state phase transition. While reference
models, which keep the expanding front flat, exhibit directed percolation
critical behavior, the exponents of the two-species Eden model strongly deviate
from it. In turn, the mutation-selection process induces an increased surface
roughness with exponents distinct from that of the classical Eden model.

ionization level, evolutionary stage, chemistry, and thermal history of
astrophysical environments. The analysis of data from ALMA and other new
telescopes requires an elaborate model of deuterium fractionation. This paper
presents a publicly available chemical network with multi-deuterated species
and an extended, up-to-date set of gas-phase and surface reactions. To test
this network, we simulate deuterium fractionation in diverse interstellar
sources. Two cases of initial abundances are considered: i) atomic except for
H2 and HD, and ii) molecular from a prestellar core. We reproduce the observed
D/H ratios of many deuterated molecules, and sort the species according to
their sensitivity to temperature gradients and initial abundances. We find that
many multiply-deuterated species produced at 10 K retain enhanced D/H ratios at
temperatures $\la 100$ K. We study how recent updates to reaction rates affect
calculated D/H ratios, and perform a detailed sensitivity analysis of the
uncertainties of the gas-phase reaction rates in the network. We find that
uncertainties are generally lower in dark cloud environments than in warm IRDCs
and that uncertainties increase with the size of the molecule and number of
D-atoms. A set of the most problematic reactions is presented. We list
potentially observable deuterated species predicted to be abundant in low- and
high-mass star-formation regions.

galaxies in the core of Coma cluster in magnitude range $-21 < M_I <-15$.
Taking advantage of high resolution DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck II for
measuring the internal velocity dispersion of galaxies and high resolution
imaging of HST/ACS, which allows an accurate surface brightness modeling, we
extend the fundamental plane (FP) of galaxies to $\sim$1 magnitude fainter
luminosities than all the previous studies of the FP in Coma cluster. We find
that, the scatter about the FP depends on the faint-end luminosity cutoff, such
that the scatter increases for fainter galaxies. The residual from the FP
correlates with the galaxy colour, with bluer galaxies showing larger residuals
from FP.
  We find $M/L \propto M^{-0.15\pm0.22}$ in F814W-band indicating that in faint
dwarf ellipticals, the $M/L$ ratio is insensitive to the mass. We find that
less massive dwarf ellipticals are bluer than their brighter counterparts,
possibly indicating ongoing star formation activity. Although tidal encounters
and harassment can play a part in removing stars and dark matter from the
galaxy, we believe that the dominant effect will be the stellar wind associated
with the star formation, which will remove material from the galaxy resulting
in larger $M/L$ ratios. We attribute the deviation of a number of faint blue
dwarfs from the FP of brighter ellipticals to this effect.
  We also study other scaling relations involving galaxy photometric properties
including the photometric plane. We show that, compared to the FP, the scatter
about the photometric plane is smaller at the faint end.

which were studied for the first time. The magnitude range of our sample is
$-21<M_R<-15$ mag.
  This paper (paper I) focuses on the measurement of the velocity dispersion
and their error estimates. The measurements were performed using {\it pPXF
(penalised PiXel Fitting)} and using the Calcium triplet absorption lines. We
use Monte Carlo bootstrapping to study various sources of uncertainty in our
measurements, namely statistical uncertainty, template mismatch and other
systematics. We find that the main source of uncertainty is the template
mismatch effect which is reduced by using templates with a range of spectral
types.
  Combining our measurements with those from the literature, we study the
Faber-Jackson relation ($L\propto\sigma^\alpha$) and find that the slope of the
relation is $\alpha=1.99\pm0.14$ for galaxies brighter than $M_R\simeq-16$ mag.
A comprehensive analysis of the results combined with the photometric

vicinity of spin-orbit resonances is investigated using comprehensive harmonic
expansions of the tidal torque taking into account the frequency-dependent
quality factors and Love numbers. The torque equations are integrated
numerically with a small step in time, includng the oscillating triaxial torque
components but neglecting the layered structure of the planet and assuming a
zero obliquity. We find that a Mercury-like planet with its current value of
orbital eccentricity (0.2056) is always captured in the 3:2 resonance. The
probability of capture in the higher 2:1 resonance is approximately 0.23. These
results are confirmed by a semi-analytical estimation of capture probabilities
as functions of eccentricity for both prograde and retrograde evolution of spin
rate. As follows from analysis of equilibrium torques, entrapment in the 3:2
resonance is inevitable at eccentricities between 0.2 and 0.41. Considering the
phase space parameters at the times of periastron, the range of spin rates and
phase angles, for which an immediate resonance passage is triggered, is very
narrow, and yet, a planet like Mercury rarely fails to align itself into this
state of unstable equilibrium before it traverses the 2:1 resonance.

diffusion from a small amount of observation data, where the behavior changes
were assumed to be effectively reflected in changes in the diffusion parameter
value. The problem is to detect where in time and how long this change
persisted and how big this change is. We solved this problem by searching the
change pattern that maximizes the likelihood of generating the observed
diffusion sequences. The naive learning algorithm has to iteratively update the
patten boundaries, each requiring optimization of diffusion parameters by the
EM algorithm, and is very inefficient. We devised a very efficient search
algorithm using the derivative of likelihood which avoids parameter value
optimization during the search. The results tested using three real world
network structures confirmed that the algorithm can efficiently identify the
correct change pattern. We further compared our algorithm with the naive method
that finds the best combination of change boundaries by an exhaustive search
through a set of randomly selected boundary candidates, and showed that the
proposed algorithm far outperforms the native method both in terms of accuracy
and computation time.

IRAC photometry 3-8um are combined with 2MASS near-IR data to identify young

Chandra X-ray data are used to identify class III pre-main sequence stars
lacking circumstellar material. We identify 624 YSOs: 23 class 0/I and 90 flat
spectrum protostars, 437 Class II stars, and 74 Class III stars. We also
identify 29 (27 new) O star candidates over the IRAC field. Seventy-two stars
exhibit IR-variability, including seven class 0/I and 12 flat spectrum YSOs. A
further 177 tentative candidates are identified by their location in the IRAC
[3.6] vs. [3.6]-[5.8] cmd. We find strong evidence of subclustering in the
region. Three subclusters were identified surrounding the central cluster, with
massive and variable stars in each subcluster. The central region shows
evidence of distinct spatial distributions of the protostars and pre-main
sequence stars. A previously detected IR cluster, DB2001_Obj36, has been
established as a subcluster of RCW 38. This suggests that star formation in RCW
38 occurs over a more extended area than previously thought. The gas to dust
ratio is examined using the X-ray derived hydrogen column density, N_H and the
K-band extinction, and found to be consistent with the diffuse ISM, in contrast
with Serpens & NGC1333. We posit that the high photoionising flux of massive
stars in RCW 38 affects the agglomeration of the dust grains.

observed data and synthetic MHD data consistent. Data from earthbound
telescopes also need accurate correction for straylight and fixed optical
aberrations. We aim to develop a method for measuring straylight in the
post-focus imaging optics of the SST. We removed any influence from atmospheric
turbulence and scattering by using an artificial target. We measured integrated
straylight from three different sources in the same data: ghost images caused
by reflections in the near-detector optics, PSFs corresponding to wavefront
aberrations in the optics by using phase diversity, and extended scattering PSF
wings of unknown origin by fitting to a number of different kernels. We
performed the analysis separately in the red and blue beams. Wavefront
aberrations, which possibly originate in the bimorph mirror of the adaptive
optics, are responsible for a wavelength-dependent straylight of 20-30% of the
intensity in the form of PSFs with 90% of the energy contained within a radius
of 0.6"". There are ghost images that contribute at the most a few % of
straylight. The fraction of other sources of scattered light from the
post-focus instrumentation of the SST is only \sim10^-3 of the recorded
intensity. This contribution has wide wings with FWHM \sim16"" in the blue and
\sim34"" in the red. The present method seems to work well for separately
estimating wavefront aberrations and the scattering kernel shape and fraction.
Ghost images can be expected at the same level for solar observations. The
high-order wavefront aberrations possibly caused by the AO bimorph mirror
dominate the measured straylight but are likely to change when imaging the Sun.
We can therefore make no firm statements about the origin of straylight in SST
data, but strongly suspect wavefront aberrations to be the dominant source.

sampling of all cluster topologies has been performed, while for N = 7 and 8
only a few representative topologies are considered. In all cases the entire
concentration range is systematically investigated. All the clusters show
ferromagnetic-like order in the optimized structures. As a result, the average
magnetic moment per atom $\bar\mu_N$ increases monotonously, which is almost
linear over a wide range of concentration with Fe content. A remarkable
enhancement of the local Fe moments beyond 3 $\mu_B$ is observed as result of
Rh doping. This is a consequence of the increase in the number of Fe $d$ holes,
due to charge transfer from Fe to Rh, combined with the extremely reduced local
coordination. The Rh local moments, which are important already in the pure
clusters ($N\le 8$) are not significantly enhanced by Fe doping. However, the
overall stability of magnetism, as measured by the energy gained upon spin
polarization, increases when Rh is replaced by Fe. The composition dependence
of the electronic structure and the influence of spin-orbit interactions on the
cluster stability are discussed.

application of the Hubbard-I approach to strongly correlated electron systems.
We propose the utility of a composite method, viz. the Hubbard-I method in
conjunction with strong coupling perturbation expansion, for studying systems
violating the afore--mentioned symmetry. We support this novel approach by
presenting a first successful Hubbard-I type calculation for the description of
the metal-insulator Mott transition in a strongly correlated electron system
with conserved double occupancies, which is a constrained Hubbard Hamiltonian
equivalent to the Hubbard bond charge Hamiltonian with $X=t$. In particular, we
obtain the phase diagram of this system for arbitrary fillings, including
details of the Mott transition at half-filling. We also compare the Hubbard-I
band--splitting Mott transition description with results obtained using the
standard Gutzwiller Approximation (GA), and show that the two approximate
approaches lead to qualitatively different results. In contrast to the GA
applied to the system studied here, the Hubbard-I approach compares favourably
with known exact results for the $d=1$ dimensional chain.

on the separation of the light from old stars from the emission contributed by
contaminants (e.g. hot dust and the 3.3 micron PAH feature). Results for a

4321, and NGC 5194) with a range of morphological properties, dust contents and
star formation histories are presented to demonstrate our approach. We use an
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) technique designed to separate
statistically independent source distributions, maximizing the distinction in
the [3.6]-[4.5] colors of the sources. The technique also removes emission from
intermediate-age evolved red objects with a low mass-to-light ratio, such as
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars, revealing maps of
the underlying old distribution of light with [3.6]-[4.5] colors consistent
with the colors of K and M giants. Contaminants are identified via comparison
to the non-stellar emission imaged at 8 microns, which is dominated by the
broad PAH feature. Using the measured 3.6/8 micron ratio to select the
individual contaminants, we find that hot dust and PAH together contribute
between ~5-15% to the integrated light at 3.6 microns, while light from regions
dominated by intermediate-age stars accounts for only 1-5%. Locally, however,
the contribution from either contaminant can reach much higher levels; dust
contributes on average 22% to the emission in star-forming regions throughout
the sample, while intermediate age-stars contribute upwards of 50% in localized
knots. The removal of these contaminants with ICA leaves maps of the old
stellar disk that retain a high degree of structural information and are
ideally suited for tracing the stellar mass, as will be the focus in a
companion paper.

background gravitational potential and using N-body simulations, we have
explored how the dissolution timescale of the cold clump in Ursa Minor depends
on m. It is demonstrated that for masses in the range 0.3x10^-22 eV < m
<1x10^-22 eV, scalar field dark halos without self-interaction would have cores
large enough to explain the longevity of the cold clump in Ursa Minor and the
wide distribution of globular clusters in Fornax, but small enough to make the
mass of the dark halos compatible with dynamical limits. It is encouraging to
see that this interval of m is consistent with that needed to suppress the
overproduction of substructure in galactic halos and is compatible with the
acoustic peaks of cosmic microwave radiation. On the other hand, for
self-interacting scalar fields with coupling constant l, values of m^4/l <=

performed on the fundamental vibrational transition of a local vibrational mode
at 2.74 {\mu}m using a continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator (OPO).
Resonant multi-photon IR dissociation spectroscopy (without the use of a UV
laser) generates charged molecular fragments, which are sympathetically cooled
and trapped, and subsequently released from the trap and counted. We measured
the cross section for R-IRMPD under conditions of low intensity, and found it
to be approximately two orders smaller than the vibrational excitation cross
section. The observed rotational bandwidth of the vibrational transition is
larger than the one expected from the combined effects of 300 K black-body
temperature, conformer-dependent line shifts, and intermolecular vibrational
relaxation broadening (J. Stearns et al., J. Chem. Phys., 127, 154322-7
(2007)). This indicates that as the internal energy of the molecule grows, an
increase of the rotational temperature of the molecular ions well above room
temperature (up to on the order of 1000K), and/or an appreciable shift of the
vibrational transition frequency (approx. 6-8 cm$^{-1}$) occurs.

The density attains a maximum for a particular family of non-symmetrical
ellipsoids, larger than the density observed for prolate or oblate ellipsoids.
As for anisotropy measures, the contact forces show are increasingly preferred
along the vertical direction as the shape of the particles deviates for a
sphere. The deposits are constructed by means of an efficient molecular

incomplete data. The task is usually tackled by running the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm several times in order to obtain a high
log-likelihood estimate. We argue that choosing the maximum log-likelihood
estimate (as well as the maximum penalized log-likelihood and the maximum a
posteriori estimate) has severe drawbacks, being affected both by overfitting
and model uncertainty. Two ideas are discussed to overcome these issues: a
maximum entropy approach and a Bayesian model averaging approach. Both ideas
can be easily applied on top of EM, while the entropy idea can be also
implemented in a more sophisticated way, through a dedicated non-linear solver.
A vast set of experiments shows that these ideas produce significantly better
estimates and inferences than the traditional and widely used maximum
(penalized) log-likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates. In particular,
if EM is adopted as optimization engine, the model averaging approach is the
best performing one; its performance is matched by the entropy approach when
implemented using the non-linear solver. The results suggest that the
applicability of these ideas is immediate (they are easy to implement and to
integrate in currently available inference engines) and that they constitute a
better way to learn Bayesian network parameters.
