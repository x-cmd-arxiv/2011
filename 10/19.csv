Blazars are radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a jet
pointing at small angles towards the observer. The overall emitted spectrum is
typically non-thermal, and in some cases the emission and/or absorption lines
are so faint as to prevent the determination of the redshift based on optical
spectroscopy methods. PKS 0447-439 is a bright blazar recently detected at very
high energy. The redshift of the source is still disputed: a recent spectral
analysis reports only a lower limit of z > 1.246, which contradicts the
previous measure of z = 0.205 reported in the literature. Aims. We aim to give
a redshift estimate of the blazar PKS 0447-439 based on combined GeV
(Fermi/LAT) and TeV (H.E.S.S.) observations. Methods. Taking into account the
absorption of TeV photons by the interaction with the extragalactic background
light (EBL), we applied the method we developed in a previous work to derive
the redshift of PKS 0447-439. Moreover, we compiled the overall spectral energy
distribution (SED) using optical-UV, soft X-ray, and -ray data, nearly
simultaneous to the H.E.S.S. observations at TeV energies. Finally we modelled
the spectral energy distribution (SED) within the framework of a homogeneous,
leptonic synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Results. Using the recent TeV
spectrum measured by H.E.S.S. we obtain for PKS 0447-439 a redshift of zrec =
0.20 \pm 0.05, which is our estimate on the source distance. This value agrees
very well with the value reported in the literature and confirms that our
method can be successfully used to constrain blazars distances. Assuming this
distance, the SED can be well fitted with the above mentioned model. The
physical parameters that we find suggest a strongly matter-dominated jet.
Conclusions. Our analysis confirms that the redshift of PKS 0447-439 is likely
0.2, and supports the result present in the literature.

measuring several moments of galaxy counts in spheres. We firstly find that the
average counts grows as a power-law function of the distance with an exponent
D= 2.1+- 0.05 for r in [0.5,20] Mpc/h and D = 2.8+-0.05 for r in [30,150]
Mpc/h. In order to estimate the systematic errors in these measurements we
consider the counts variance finding that it shows systematic finite size
effects which depend on the samples sizes. We clarify, by making specific
tests, that these are due to galaxy long-range correlations extending up to the
largest scales of the sample. The analysis of mock galaxy catalogs, generated
from cosmological N-body simulations of the standard LCDM model, shows that for
r<20 Mpc/h the counts exponent is D~2.0, weakly dependent on galaxy luminosity,
while D=3 at larger scales. In addition, contrary to the case of the observed
galaxy samples, no systematic finite size effects in the counts variance are
found at large scales, a result that agrees with the absence of large scale,
r~100 Mpc/h, correlations in the mock catalogs. We thus conclude that the
observed galaxy distribution is characterized by correlations, fluctuations and
hence structures, which are larger, both in amplitude and in spatial extension,
than those predicted by the standard model LCDM of galaxy formation.

density range of the nuclear `pasta' phases at the bottom of the crust provided
by the compressible liquid drop model in the light of current experimental and
theoretical constraints on model parameters. Using a Skyrme-like model for
nuclear matter, we construct baseline sequences of crust models by consistently
varying the density dependence of the bulk symmetry energy at nuclear
saturation density, $L$, under two conditions: (i) that the magnitude of the
symmetry energy at saturation density $J$ is held constant, and (ii) $J$
correlates with $L$ under the constraint that the pure neutron matter (PNM) EoS
satisfies the results of ab-initio calculations at low densities. Such baseline
crust models facilitate consistent exploration of the $L$ dependence of crustal
properties. The remaining surface energy and symmetric nuclear matter
parameters are systematically varied around the baseline, and different
functional forms of the PNM EoS at sub-saturation densities implemented, to
estimate theoretical `error bars' for the baseline predictions. Inner crust
composition and transition densities are shown to be most sensitive to the
surface energy at very low proton fractions and to the behavior of the
sub-saturation PNM EoS. Recent calculations of the energies of neutron drops
suggest that the low-proton-fraction surface energy might be higher than
predicted in Skyrme-like models, which our study suggests may result in a
greatly reduced volume of pasta in the crust than conventionally predicted.

solution is a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is
impractical to implement. In response, we propose a greedy approach to joint
scheduling and resource allocation that maintains a posterior channel
distribution for every user, and has only polynomial complexity. For
frequency-selective channels with Markov time-variation, we then outline a
recursive method to update the channel posteriors, based on the ACK/NAK
feedback, that is made computationally efficient through the use of particle
filtering. To gauge the performance of our greedy approach relative to that of
the optimal POMDP, we derive a POMDP performance upper-bound. Numerical
experiments show that, for slowly fading channels, the performance of our
greedy scheme is relatively close to the upper bound, and much better than
fixed-power random user scheduling (FP-RUS), despite its relatively low

these two samples indicate that the fraction of objects with disk and spheroid
morphologies is roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers,
interactions, and irregular galaxies among the ULIRGs. The combination of disk
and irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early stage interactions
and minor mergers could play an important role in ULIRGs at z~2. We compare
these fractions with those of a z~1 sample across a wide luminosity range and
find that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with L_IR while the
fraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally.
At comparable luminosities, the fraction of ULIRGs with various morphological
classifications is similar at z~2 and z~1. We investigate the position of the

included as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to 73% of starbursts
are involved in a merger or interaction at some level. Although the final
coalescence of a major merger may not be required for the high luminosities of
ULIRGs at z~2 as is the case locally, the large fraction of interactions at all
stages and potential minor mergers suggest that the high star formation rates
of ULIRGs are still largely externally triggered at z~2.

  equations, Adv. Math. 245 (2013) 534--572",,,"math.AG math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  What polynomial in the coefficients of a system of algebraic equations should
be called its discriminant? We prove a package of facts that provide a possible
answer. Let us call a system typical, if the homeomorphic type of its set of
solutions does not change as we perturb its (non-zero) coefficients. The set of
all atypical systems turns out to be a hypersurface in the space of all systems
of k equations in n variables, whose monomials are contained in k given finite
sets. This hypersurface B contains all systems that have a singular solution,
this stratum is conventionally called the discriminant, and the codimension of
its components has not been fully understood yet (e.g. dual defect toric
varieties are not classified), so the purity of dimension of B looks somewhat
surprising. We deduce it from a similar tropical purity fact.
  A generic system of equations in a component B_i of the hypersurface B
differs from a typical system by the Euler characteristic of its set of
solutions. Regarding the difference of these Euler characteristics as the
multiplicity of B_i, we turn B into an effective divisor, whose equation we
call the Euler discriminant by the following reasons. Firstly, it vanishes
exactly at those systems that have a singular solution (possibly at infinity).
Secondly, despite its topological definition, there is a simple
linear-algebraic formula for it, and a positive formula for its Newton
polytope. Thirdly, it interpolates many classical objects (sparse resultant,
A-determinant, discriminant of deformation) and inherits many of their nice
properties. This allows to specialize our results to generic polynomial maps:
the bifurcation set of a dominant polynomial map, whose components are generic
linear combinations of finitely many monomials, is always a hypersurface, and a
generic atypical fiber of such a map differs from a typical one by its Euler
characteristic.

photoelectron spectroscopy and scanned angle x-ray photoelectron diffraction,
we determine that on average ~13 % of the O anions in the surface layer are
replaced by F, but that F does not occupy O sites in deeper layers. Despite
this perturbation to the surface, the Fermi level remains unpinned, and the
surface-state density, which determines the amount of band bending, is driven
by factors other than F doping. The presence of F at the STO surface is
expected to result in lower electron mobilities at complex oxide
heterojunctions involving STO substrates because of impurity scattering.
Unintentional F doping can be substantially reduced by replacing the HF-etch
step with a boil in deionized water, which in conjunction with an oxygen tube
furnace anneal, leaves the surface flat and TiO2 terminated.

unclassified variables may be a non-member on account of its large angular

stars, which include two eclipsing binaries and two very red stars showing
year-to-year variations, are certain non-members. One of the remaining two
faintest variable stars, an EA-type eclipsing binary may be a member, while the
faintest one, a W Ursae Majoris-type variable, is probably a non-member. For
6937 stars we provide the V magnitudes and (V-I)_C color indices on the
standard system. Because of nonuniform reddening over the cluster's face, a
direct comparison of these data with theoretical isochrones is not possible. We
therefore obtain E(B-V) from available UBV photometry, determine the lower and
upper bound of E(B-V) for NGC 6834, and then fit properly reddened Padova
isochrones to the data. Assuming HDE 332843, an early-F supergiant, to be a

model as the partition function of an ideal Fermi gas with a non-trivial,

elementary derivation of the N^{3/2} behavior for ABJM theory and N=3 quiver

to the original matrix integral can be simply determined by a next-to-leading

show that, for several quiver Chern-Simons-matter theories, it is given by an
Airy function. This generalizes a recent result of Fuji, Hirano and Moriyama

corresponds to a strong coupling expansion in type IIA theory, and it is dual
to the genus expansion. This allows us to calculate explicitly non-perturbative

Auxiliary EVLA observations were performed to allow for the absolute

cross correlating the right and left circular polarization spectra as well as
the S-curve fitting. Additionally, we analyzed the 1612 MHz OH maser

polarization vectors are consistent with a dipole field morphology in this

cosmological perturbations in models of multi-field inflation. We find that in
many instances the presence of light degrees of freedom leads to situations in
which next to leading order slow-roll corrections become significant. Examples
where we expect such corrections to be crucial include models in which modes
exit the Hubble radius while the inflationary trajectory undergoes an abrupt
turn in field space, or during a phase transition. We illustrate this with two
examples -- hybrid inflation and double quadratic inflation. Utilizing both
analytic estimates and full numerical results, we find that corrections can be
as large as 20%. Our results have implications for many existing models in the
literature, as these corrections must be included to obtain accurate
observational predictions -- particularly given the level of accuracy expected
from CMB experiments such as Planck

As an application we prove a rigidity theorem for CR mappings between

(not equivalent to a sphere) to another hyperquadric $Q(A,B)$, either the image

a constant depending only on $B$. Finally, we prove a stability result about
existence of nontrivial CR mappings of hyperquadrics. That is, as long as both
$A$ and $B$ are sufficiently large and comparable, then there exist CR mappings
whose image is not contained in a hyperplane. The rigidity result also extends
when mapping to hyperquadrics in infinite dimensional Hilbert-space.

the investigation of the effects of the retention of supernova remnants,
especially that of the massive stellar remnant black holes (BHs), in star
clusters. By virtue of their eventual high central concentration, these stellar
mass BHs potentially invoke a wide variety of physical phenomena, the most
important ones being emission of gravitational waves (GWs), formation of X-ray
binaries, and modification of the dynamical evolution of the cluster. Here we
propose, for the first time, that rapid removal of stars from the outer parts
of a cluster by the strong tidal field in the inner region of our Galaxy can
unveil its BH sub-cluster, which appears as a star cluster that is
gravitationally bound by an invisible mass. We study the formation and
properties of such systems through direct N-body computations and estimate that
they can be present in significant numbers in the inner region of the Milky
Way. We call such objects ""dark star clusters"" (DSCs) as they appear dimmer
than normal star clusters of similar mass and they comprise a predicted, new
class of entities. The finding of DSCs will robustly cross-check BH retention;
they will not only constrain the uncertain natal kicks of BHs, thereby the
widely debated theoretical models of BH formation, but will also pinpoint star
clusters as potential sites for GW emission for forthcoming ground-based
detectors such as the Advanced LIGO. Finally, we also discuss the relevance of
DSCs for the nature of IRS 13E.

often-quoted values ranging from 1 to 10 solar masses per year. This situation
persists despite the potential for the Milky Way to serve as the ultimate SFR
calibrator for external galaxies. We show that various estimates for the
Galactic SFR are consistent with one another once they have been normalized to
the same initial mass function (IMF) and massive star models, converging to 1.9
+/- 0.4 M_sun/yr. However, standard SFR diagnostics are vulnerable to
systematics founded in the use of indirect observational tracers sensitive only
to high-mass stars. We find that absolute SFRs measured using resolved
low/intermediate-mass stellar populations in Galactic H II regions are
systematically higher by factors of ~2-3 as compared with calibrations for SFRs
measured from mid-IR and radio emission. We discuss some potential explanations
for this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law
slope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M_sun < m < 5 M_sun) stars were
steeper than the Salpeter slope, or (2) a correction factor was applied to the
extragalactic 24 micron SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star
formation in individual mid-IR-bright H II regions relative to the lifetimes of
O stars. Finally, we present some approaches for testing if a Galactic SFR of
~2 M_sun/yr is consistent with what we would measure if we could view the Milky

point sources, we find that the Milky Way deviates from expectations at the 1-3

extragalactic SFRs need to be revised upwards.

lensing-weighted mean stellar masses of 0.6, 2.7, and 6.5 x 10^10 M_sun, we
find halo-to-stellar mass ratios M_vir/M_* = 41, 23, and 26, with 1-sigma

comparable, if the dark matter halo profile has not been significantly modified
by baryons. The results obtained in this work will serve as inputs to and
constraints on disk galaxy formation models, which will be explored in future

excellent photometric data in six filter bands covering a wavelength range from
approx. 350 to 1800 nm, significantly expanding the pre-existing data set for
this event. Combining GROND and Swift data, the early broad-band SED is
modelled with a blackbody and afterglow component attenuated by dust and gas
absorption. The best-fit SED models imply moderate reddening along the line of
sight through the host galaxy (A_V = 1.2 \pm 0.1 mag). The temperature and
radius evolution of the thermal component are analysed and combined with
earlier measurements available from the literature. This reveals a cooling
envelope at an apparent initial radius of 7 \times 10^11 cm, which is
compatible with a dense wind surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star. Multicolour
templates of SN 1998bw are fitted to the SN to directly compare the light-curve

maximum brightness at ~8 days after the burst in the blue bands, SN 2010bh
proves to be the most rapidly evolving GRB-SNe to date. Finally, a

lightcurve of Vesta combining new observations by Hubble Space Telescope and
Swift Gamma-ray Burst Observatory with archival International Ultraviolet
Explorer observations. The geometric albedos of Vesta from 220 nm to 953 nm are
derived by carefully comparing these observations from various instruments at
different times and observing geometries. Vesta has a rotationally averaged
geometric albedo of 0.09 at 250 nm, 0.14 at 300 nm, 0.26 at 373 nm, 0.38 at 673
nm, and 0.30 at 950 nm. The linear spectral slope as measured between 240 and
320 nm in the ultraviolet displays a sharp minimum near a sub-Earth longitude
of 20^{\circ}, and maximum in the eastern hemisphere. This is consistent with
the longitudinal distribution of the spectral slope in the visible wavelength.
The photometric uncertainty in the ultraviolet is ~20%, and in the visible
wavelengths it is better than 10%. The amplitude of Vesta's rotational
lightcurves is ~10% throughout the range of wavelengths we observed, but is
smaller at 950 nm (~6%) near the 1-\mum band center. Contrary to earlier
reports, we found no evidence for any difference between the phasing of the
ultraviolet and visible/near-infrared lightcurves with respect to sub-Earth
longitude. Vesta's average spectrum between 220 and 950 nm can well be
described by measured reflectance spectra of fine particle howardite-like
materials of basaltic achondrite meteorites. Combining this with the in-phase
behavior of the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared lightcurves, and the
spectral slopes with respect to the rotational phase, we conclude that there is
no global ultraviolet/visible reversal on Vesta. Consequently, this implies a
lack of global space weathering on Vesta, as previously inferred from
visible-near-infrared data.

first generation of galaxies, escape into the intergalactic medium carrying an
electric current that induces return currents, $j_t$, and associated electric
fields, $\vec E=\eta\vec j_t$ there. Because the resistivity, $\eta$, depends
on the IGM temperature, which is highly inhomogeneous due to adiabatic
contraction and shocks produced by structure formation, a non-vanishing curl of
the electric field exists which sustains the growth of magnetic field. In this

giant branch (AGB) star selection made using near-IR photometry, and
investigate the spatial distribution of the C/M ratio in NGC 6822, based on low
resolution spectroscopy and near-IR photometry. Methods: We obtained low
resolution multi-object spectroscopy with the VIMOS instrument at the ESO VLT
of ~ 800 stars in seven fields centred on NGC 6822. The spectroscopic
classification of giant stars in NGC 6822 and foreground dwarf contaminants was
made by comparing more than 500 good quality spectra with the spectroscopic
atlas of Turnshek et al. (1985). The sample of spectroscopically confirmed AGB
stars in NGC 6822 is divided into C- and M-rich giants to constrain the C vs. M
AGB star selection criteria based on photometry. The larger near-IR photometric
sample is then used to investigate the C/M ratio gradients across the galaxy.
Results: We present the largest catalogue of near-IR photometry and spectra of

the C-stars in our catalogue are redder than (J-K)0=1.2 mag, and 12% are
brighter than K0=16.45 mag and bluer than (J-K)0=1.2 mag. The remaining 9% are
mixed with the M-type AGB stars, 88% of which have colours J-H0>0.73 mag and
(J-K)0 between 0.9 mag and 1.2 mag. The remainder are mixed with dwarfs and
C-type stars. The foreground dwarfs have preferably colours (J-H)0<0.73 mag
(95%). Using the proposed criteria, we estimate that the overall C/M ratio of
the galaxy is around 0.8 with a spread between 0.2<C/M<1.8. These results
suggest that the metallicity index [Fe/H] is between -1.2 dex and -1.3 dex
according to the different calibrations and that there is a significant spread
of about 0.4 - 0.6 dex. We also discuss age rather than metallicity variations

black holes at high-redshift and that the integrated black hole density at z=6
as inferred from X-ray observations is ~100 times greater than inferred from
optical quasars. I have performed a stacking analysis of very deep Chandra
X-ray data at the positions of photometrically-selected z=6 galaxy candidates.
It is found that there is no evidence for a stacked X-ray signal in either the
soft (0.5-2 keV) or hard (2-8 keV) X-ray bands. Previous work which reported a
significant signal is affected by an incorrect method of background subtraction
which underestimates the true background within the target aperture. The puzzle
remains of why the z=6 black hole mass function has such a flat slope and a low
normalization compared to the stellar mass function.

markets. The analysis applies Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price
repeat sales indexes from 384 metropolitan areas to estimate a multi-factor
model of U.S. housing market integration. It then identifies statistical jumps
in metropolitan house price returns as well as MSA contemporaneous and lagged
jump correlations. Finally, the paper evaluates contagion in housing markets
via parametric assessment of MSA house price spatial dynamics.
  A R-squared measure reveals an upward trend in MSA housing market integration
over the 2000s to approximately .83 in 2010. Among California MSAs, the trend
was especially pronounced, as average integration increased from about .55 in
1997 to close to .95 in 2008! The 2000s bubble period similarly was
characterized by elevated incidence of statistical jumps in housing returns.
Again, jump incidence and MSA jump correlations were especially high in
California. Analysis of contagion among California markets indicates that house
price returns in San Francisco often led those of surrounding communities; in
contrast, southern California MSA house price returns appeared to move largely
in lock step.
  The high levels of housing market integration evidenced in the analysis
suggest limited investor opportunity to diversify away MSA-specific housing
risk. Further, results suggest that macro and policy shocks propagate through a
large number of MSA housing markets. Research findings are relevant to all
market participants, including institutional investors in MBS as well as those
who regulate housing, the housing GSEs, mortgage lenders, and related financial
institutions.

the literature that maximizes the minimum end-to-end receive signal-to-noise

number of users and the number of relays. Then a suboptimal RS (SRS) scheme is
proposed, which has linear complexity in the number of relays and quadratic
complexity in the number of users. Furthermore, diversity orders of both the
ORS and the proposed SRS are theoretically derived and compared with those of a
naive RS scheme and the single-user RS network. It is shown that the ORS
achieves full diversity; while the diversity order of the SRS decreases with
the the number of users. For two-user networks, the outage probabilities and

moderate to high flow rates in microchannels, accurately control them and
finally, due to their deterministic nature, program them into microfluidic
platforms. Based on the flow conditions and due to the presence of the pillars
in the channel, the flow streamlines will lose their fore-aft symmetry. As a
result of this broken symmetry the fluid is pushed away from the pillar at the
center of the channel (i.e. central z-plane). As the flow needs to maintain
conservation of mass, the fluid will laterally travel in the opposite direction
near the top and bottom walls. Therefore, a NET secondary flow will be created
in the channel cross-section which is depicted in this video.
  The main platform is a simple straight channel with posts (i.e. cylindrical
pillars - although other pillar cross-sections should also function) placed
along the channel. Channel measures were 200 \mum\times50 \mum, with pillars of
100 \mum in diameter. Positioning the pillars in different locations within the
cross-section of the channel will result in induction of different secondary
flow patterns, which can be carefully engineered. The longitudinal spacing of
the pillars is another design parameter (600 \mum spacing was used for this
video). The device works over a wide range (moderate to high) flow rates. We
used 150 \muL/min in this experiment. The device has 3 inlets where a dye
stream is co-flowed between two water streams. In this video, one can see the
effect of the net secondary flow created by inertia in the microchannel by
visualizing the cross-section of the fluorescently labeled stream. Confocal
images are sequentially taken at the inlet and after 49 consecutive pillars.

careful consideration of the assumptions of the simplified method and its
results, including a comparison with GSEA's on a large benchmark set of 50
datasets. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that gene-gene
correlations cannot be ignored due to the significant variance inflation they
produced on the enrichment scores and should be taken into account when

Exciton Scattering Model (IESM) and the effective mass based electronic
structure model for the lead chalocogenide semiconductors. The analysis of the
IESM predicted CM pathways shows complete lack of the pathway interference
during the biexciton photogeneration. This allows us to interpret the biexciton
photogeneration as a single impact ionization (II) event and to explain major
contribution of the multiple II events during the phonon-induced population
relaxation into the total quantum efficiency (QE). We investigate the role of
quantum confinement on QE, and find that the reduction in the biexciton density
of states (DOS) overruns weak enhancement of the Coulomb interactions leading
to lower QE values in NCs as compared to the bulk on the absolute photon energy
scale. However, represented on the photon energy scale normalized by
corresponding band gap energies the trend in QE is opposite demonstrating the
advantage of NCs for photovoltaic applications. Comparison to experiment allows
us to interpret the observed features and to validate the applicability range

dependence for the gaussian pulses. Finally, comparison of the key quantities

neuroimaging data, often replacing more traditional ""mass univariate""
techniques that fit data one voxel at a time. In the functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) literature, this has led to broad application of
""off-the-shelf"" classification and regression methods. These generic approaches
allow investigators to use ready-made algorithms to accurately decode
perceptual, cognitive, or behavioral states from distributed patterns of neural
activity. However, when applied to correlated whole-brain fMRI data these
methods suffer from coefficient instability, are sensitive to outliers, and
yield dense solutions that are hard to interpret without arbitrary
thresholding. Here, we develop variants of the the Graph-constrained Elastic
Net (GraphNet), ..., we (1) extend GraphNet to include robust loss functions
that confer insensitivity to outliers, (2) equip them with ""adaptive"" penalties
that asymptotically guarantee correct variable selection, and (3) develop a
novel sparse structured Support Vector GraphNet classifier (SVGN). When applied
to previously published data, these efficient whole-brain methods significantly
improved classification accuracy over previously reported VOI-based analyses on
the same data while discovering task-related regions not documented in the
original VOI approach. Critically, GraphNet estimates generalize well to
out-of-sample data collected more than three years later on the same task but
with different subjects and stimuli. By enabling robust and efficient selection
of important voxels from whole-brain data taken over multiple time points
(>100,000 ""features""), these methods enable data-driven selection of brain
areas that accurately predict single-trial behavior within and across
individuals.

algorithms.
  The first problem we study is the traffic-redundancy aware network design
(RAND) problem. We are given a weighted graph over a single server and many
clients. The server owns a number of different data packets and each client
desires a subset of the packets; the client demand sets form a laminar set
system. Our goal is to connect every client to the source via a single path,
such that the collective cost of the resulting network is minimized. Here the
transportation cost over an edge is its weight times times the number of
distinct packets that it carries.
  The second problem is a facility location problem that we call RAFL. Here the
goal is to find an assignment from clients to facilities such that the total
cost of routing packets from the facilities to clients (along unshared paths),
plus the total cost of ""producing"" one copy of each desired packet at each
facility is minimized.
  We present a constant factor approximation for the RAFL and an O(log P)
approximation for RAND, where P is the total number of distinct packets. We
remark that P is always at most the number of different demand sets desired or
the number of clients, and is generally much smaller.

only communicate messages, including higher-order communications via session

Firstly, we discuss our implementation experience from improving the SJ Runtime

runtime. We implement a transport component for secure session execution that
uses a modified TLS connection with authentication based on the Secure Remote

concurrent object-oriented language that formalises such protocols in the form
of usage types. Usage types are attached to class definitions, allowing for the
specification of (1) the available methods, (2) the tests clients must perform

which depend on the object's state. Our work extends the recent approach on
modular session types by eliminating channel operations, and defining the
method call as the single communication primitive in both sequential and
concurrent settings. In contrast to previous works, we define a single category
for objects, instead of distinct categories for linear and for shared objects,
and let linear objects evolve into shared ones. We introduce a standard sync
qualifier to prevent thread interference in certain operations on shared
objects. We formalise the language syntax, the operational semantics, and a
type system that enforces by static typing that methods are called only when
available, and by a single client if so specified in the usage type. We
illustrate the language via a complete example.

near its present mass, the planet's tides opened an optically-thin gap in the
nebula. We show using Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations that sunlight
absorbed by the nebula and re-radiated into the gap raised temperatures well
above the sublimation threshold for water ice, with potentially drastic
consequences for the icy bodies in Jupiter's feeding zone. Bodies up to a meter

planetesimals were partially to fully devolatilized, depending on their size.
Scenarios in which Jupiter formed promptly, such as those involving a
gravitational instability of the massive early nebula, must cope with the high
temperatures. Enriching Jupiter in the noble gases through delivery trapped in
clathrate hydrates will be more difficult, but might be achieved by either
forming the planet much further from the star, or capturing planetesimals at
later epochs. The hot gap resulting from an early origin for Jupiter also would
affect the surface compositions of any primordial Trojan asteroids.

the detection of primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation,

of state of the Universe after inflation. Based on Fisher information
formalism, we examine how accurately the tensor-to-scalar ratio and reheating
temperature after inflation can be simultaneously determined with space-based
gravitational wave detectors such as the DECI-hertz Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the Big-Bang Observer (BBO). We
show that the reheating temperature is best determined if it is around 10^7 GeV
for tensor-to-scalar ratio of around 0.1, and explore the detectable parameter
space. We also find that equation of state of the early Universe can be also
determined accurately enough to distinguish different equation-of-state
parameters if the inflationary gravitational waves are successfully detected.
Thus future gravitational wave detectors provide a unique and promising
opportunity to reveal the thermal history of the Universe around 10^7 GeV.

the dwarf early-type galaxy population in Coma for the first time. The
Schechter faint-end slopes (alpha = -1.39 in both GALEX bands) are shallower
than reported in previous Coma UV LF studies owing to a flatter LF at faint
magnitudes. A Gaussian-plus-Schechter model provides a slightly better
parametrization of the UV LFs resulting in a faint-end slope of ~ -1.15 in both
GALEX bands. The two-component model gives faint-end slopes shallower than -1
(a turnover) for the LFs constructed separately for passive and star forming

owing to a deficit of dwarf star forming galaxies in Coma with stellar masses
below M*=10^8 Msun. A similar turnover is identified in recent UV LFs measured
for the Virgo cluster suggesting this may be a common feature of local galaxy
clusters, whereas the field UV LFs continue to rise at faint magnitudes. We did
not identify an excess of passive galaxies as would be expected if the missing
dwarf star forming galaxies were quenched inside the cluster. In fact, the LFs
for both dwarf passive and star forming galaxies show the same turnover at

visible defects are antiphase boundaries in the YBCO layers that originate from
perovskite unit cell height steps at the interfaces with the LCMO layers. We
also find that the first YBCO monolayer at the interface with LCMO has an
unusual growth dynamics and is lacking the CuO chain layer while the subsequent
YBCO layers have the regular Y-123 structure. Accordingly, the CuO2 bilayers at
both the LCMO/YBCO and the YBCO/LCMO interfaces are lacking one of their
neighboring CuO chain layers and thus half of their hole doping reservoir.

CMA-ES algorithm. The injected solutions might stem from a gradient or a Newton
step, a surrogate model optimizer or any other oracle or search mechanism. They
can also be the result of a repair mechanism, for example to render infeasible
solutions feasible. Only small modifications to the CMA-ES are necessary to
turn injection into a reliable and effective method: too long steps need to be
tightly renormalized. The main objective of this report is to reveal this
simple mechanism. Depending on the source of the injected solutions,
interesting variants of CMA-ES arise. When the best-ever solution is always
(re-)injected, an elitist variant of CMA-ES with weighted multi-recombination
arises. When \emph{all} solutions are injected from an \emph{external} source,
the resulting algorithm might be viewed as \emph{adaptive encoding} with
step-size control. In first experiments, injected solutions of very good
quality lead to a convergence speed twice as fast as on the (simple) sphere
function without injection. This means that we observe an impressive speed-up
on otherwise difficult to solve functions. Single bad injected solutions on the
other hand do no significant harm.

of this approach is that the enrichment functions are defined only on a small

disks'internal dissipation and reprocessing of irradiation from their host
stars. Around T Tauri stars, most mid-infrared (MIR) radiation (in a few to a
few ten {\mu}m wavelength range) emerge from regions around a fraction to a few
AU's. This region is interesting because it contains both the habitable zone
and the snow line. Recent observations reveal that SED variations, in the MIR
wavelength range. These variations are puzzling because they occur on time
scale (a few days) which is much shorter than the dynamical (months to years)
time scale at 1AU to a few AU's. They are probably caused by shadows casted by
inner onto outer disk regions. Interaction between disks and their misaligned
magnetized host stars can lead to warped structure and periodic SED
modulations. Rapid aperiodic SED variations may also be induced by observed
X-ray flares from T Tauri stars. These flares can significantly modulate the
ionization fraction of the gas and the net charge carried by the grains near
the surface of the inner disk. The newly charged grains may be accelerated by
the stellar or disk magnetic field and adjust their distances from the
midplane. Shadows casted by these grains attenuates the flux of stellar photons
irradiated onto regions at several AU's from the central stars. We use this
model to account for the observed rapid aperiodic SED variabilities. We suggest
regular monitoring of SED variations will not only provide valuable information
on the distribution of the disk aspect ratio near the habitable zone but also
provide a probe on the interaction between the inner regions of the disk with
the magnetosphere of their host stars.

viscosity. In order to solve the integrated equations which govern the
dynamical behavior of the accretion flow, self-similar solution was used. The
solutions show that the behavior of physical quantities in a dynamical ADAF are
different from steady accretion flow and a disk with polytropic approach. The
solution indicates a transonic point in the accretion flow for all selected
amounts of advection parameter. Also, by adding strength of the magnetic field

and the stellar disk mass of late-type galaxies in the local universe. This
relationship is derived by comparing the stellar disk mass function from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the HI mass function from the HI Parkes All Sky
Survey (HIPASS). We find that the HI mass in late-type galaxies tightly
correlates with the stellar mass over three orders of magnitude in stellar disk
mass. We cross-check our result with that obtained from a sample of HIPASS
objects for which the stellar mass has been obtained by inner kinematics. In
addition, we derive the HI versus halo mass relationship and the dependence of
all the baryonic components in spirals on the host halo mass. These
relationships bear the imprint of the processes ruling galaxy formation, and
highlight the inefficiency of galaxies both in forming stars and in retaining
their pristine HI gas.

conjunctive queries ($\ACQ$). The unweighted quantifier free version of this
problem is known to be tractable (for combined complexity), but it is also
known that introducing even a single quantified variable makes it $\sP$-hard.
We first show that weighted counting for quantifier-free $\ACQ$ is still
tractable and that even minimalistic extensions of the problem lead to hard
cases. We then introduce a new parameter for quantified queries that permits to
isolate large island of tractability. We show that, up to a standard assumption
from parameterized complexity, this parameter fully characterizes tractable
subclasses for counting weighted solutions of $\ACQ$ queries. Thus we
completely determine the tractability frontier for weighted counting for
$\ACQ$.

fast radial search and rectangular search using provided stored functions in
SQL similar to SDSS SkyServer. Our software kit utilizes open-source RDBMS, and
therefore any astronomers and developers can install our kit on their personal
computers for research, observation, etc. Out kit is tuned for optimal
coordinate search performance. We implement an effective radial search using an
orthogonal coordinate system, which does not need any techniques that depend on
HTM or HEALpix. Applying the xyz coordinate system to the database index, we
can easily implement a system of fast radial search for relatively small (less
than several million rows) catalogs. To enable high-speed search of huge
catalogs on RDBMS, we apply three additional techniques: table partitioning,
composite expression index, and optimization in stored functions. As a result,
we obtain satisfactory performance of radial search for the 2MASS catalog. Our
system can also perform fast rectangular search. It is implemented using
techniques similar to those applied for radial search. Our way of
implementation enables a compact system and will give important hints for a
low-cost development of other huge catalog databases.

the collapse of spherical homogeneous molecular clouds, fragmentation of the

cloud's initial angular momentum alone. In effect, this condition is equivalent
to requiring the resulting disc be sufficiently extended in order to fragment,
in line with studies of isolated discs. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics
with hybrid radiative transfer to investigate this claim, confirming that in
general, homogeneous spherical molecular clouds will produce fragmenting
self-gravitating discs if the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to
gravitational potential energy is greater than ~ 5e-3, where this result is
relatively insensitive to the initial thermal energy. This condition begins to
fail at higher cloud masses, suggesting that sufficient mass at large radii
governs fragmentation. While these results are based on highly idealised
initial conditions, and may not hold if the disc's accretion from the
surrounding envelope is sufficiently asymmetric, or if the density structure is
perturbed, they provide a sensible lower limit for the minimum angular momentum
required to fragment a disc in the absence of significant external turbulence.

Galaxy. Despite the large interstellar reddening towards Cyg OB2, many studies,
spanning a wide range of wavelengths, have been conducted to more clearly
understand this association. X-ray observations provide a powerful tool to
overcome the effect of interstellar absorption and study the most energetic
processes associated with the stars in Cyg OB2. We analyse XMM-Newton data to
investigate the X-ray and UV properties of massive O-type stars as well as
low-mass pre-main sequence stars in Cyg OB2. We obtained six XMM-Newton
observations of the core of Cyg OB2. In our analysis, we pay particular
attention to the variability of the X-ray bright OB stars, especially the
luminous blue variable candidate Cyg OB2 #12. We find that X-ray variability is
quite common among the stars in Cyg OB2. Whilst short-term variations are
restricted mostly to low-mass pre-main sequence stars, one third of the OB
stars display long-term variations. The X-ray flux of Cyg OB2 #12 varies by
37%, over timescales from days to years, whilst its mean log(L_X/L_bol) amounts
to -6.10. These properties suggest that Cyg OB2 #12 is either an
interacting-wind system or displays a magnetically confined wind. Two other
X-ray bright O-type stars (MT91 516 and CPR2002 A11) display variations that
suggest they are interacting wind binary systems.

SNR/molecular cloud interaction through detection of [OI] emission, ionic
lines, and emission from molecular hydrogen. Through black-body fitting of the
MIPS SEDs we find the large grains to be warm, 29-66 K. The dust emission is
modeled using the DUSTEM code and a three component dust model composed of
populations of big grains, very small grains, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. We find the dust to be moderately heated, typically by 30-100
times the interstellar radiation field. The source of the radiation is likely
hydrogen recombination, where the excitation of hydrogen occurred in the shock
front. The ratio of very small grains to big grains is found for most of the
molecular interacting SNRs to be higher than that found in the plane of the
Milky Way, typically by a factor of 2--3. We suggest that dust shattering is
responsible for the relative over-abundance of small grains, in agreement with
prediction from dust destruction models. However, two of the SNRs are best fit
with a very low abundance of carbon grains to silicate grains and with a very
high radiation field. A likely reason for the low abundance of small carbon
grains is sputtering. We find evidence for silicate emission at 20 $\mu$m in
their SEDs, indicating that they are young SNRs based on the strong radiation
field necessary to reproduce the observed SEDs.

from topological dynamics, constitute a special class of IP-sets possessing
additional nice combinatorial properties: Each central set contains arbitrarily
long arithmetic progressions, and solutions to all partition regular systems of
homogeneous linear equations. In this paper we show how certain families of
aperiodic words of low factor complexity may be used to generate a wide
assortment of central sets having additional nice properties inherited from the
rich combinatorial structure of the underlying word. We consider Sturmian words
and their extensions to higher alphabets (so-called Arnoux-Rauzy words), as
well as words generated by substitution rules including the famous Thue-Morse
word. We also describe a connection between central sets and the strong
coincidence condition for fixed points of primitive substitutions which
represents a new approach to the strong coincidence conjecture for irreducible
Pisot substitutions. Our methods simultaneously exploit the general theory of
combinatorics on words, the arithmetic properties of abstract numeration
systems defined by substitution rules, notions from topological dynamics
including proximality and equicontinuity, the spectral theory of symbolic
dynamical systems, and the beautiful and elegant theory, developed by N.

We compare baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF) and Faber-Jackson (BFJ) relations for

for pruned subsets of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated systems. The BFJ
relation is significantly less scattered than the BTF when the relations are
applied to their maximum samples, and is not affected by the inclination
problems that plague the BTF. Disk-dominated, gas-rich galaxies systematically
deviate from the BFJ relation defined by the spheroids. We demonstrate that by
applying a simple correction to the stellar velocity dispersions that depends
only on the concentration index of the galaxy, we are able to bring disks and
spheroids onto the same dynamical relation -- in other words, we obtain a
generalized BFJ relation that holds for all the galaxies in our sample,
regardless of morphology, inclination or gas content, and has a scatter smaller
than 0.1 dex. We find that disks and spheroids are offset in the stellar
dispersion-size relation, and that the offset is removed when corrected
dispersions are used instead. The generalized BFJ relation represents a
fundamental correlation between the global dark matter and baryonic content of
galaxies, which is obeyed by all (massive) systems regardless of morphology.

basic examples of slice regular functions are power series centered at 0 on
their balls of convergence. Conversely, if f is a slice regular function then
it admits at each point of its domain an expansion into power series, where the
powers are taken with respect to an appropriately defined multiplication *.
However, the information provided by such an expansion is somewhat limited by a
fact: if the center p of the series does not lie on the real axis then the set
of convergence needs not be a Euclidean neighborhood of p. We are now able to
construct a new type of expansion that is not affected by this phenomenon: an
expansion into series of polynomials valid in open subsets of the domain. Along
with this construction, we present applications to the computation of the
multiplicities of zeros and of partial derivatives.

spherical Ge islands on air-exposed Si(111)-(7\times7) surfaces has been
investigated by in-situ scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and ex-situ high
resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (HRXTEM). A thin
oxide is formed on Si(111)-(7\times7) surfaces via air exposure. Ge islands are
grown on this oxide. STM measurements reveal the growth of very small (~2 nm
diameter) Ge islands with a high number density of about 1.8\times10^12 cm-2.
The island size has been found to depend on the amount of deposited Ge as well
as the substrate temperature during Ge deposition. HRXTEM micrographs reveal
that the islands are nearly spherical in shape, making narrow-neck contact with
the substrate surface. At 520{\deg}C growth temperature both epitaxial and
non-epitaxial islands grow. However, at 550{\deg}C, Ge islands predominantly
grow epitaxially by a narrow-contact with Si via voids in the oxide layer.
Growth of vertically elongated Ge islands is also observed in HRXTEM
measurements with a very small diameter-to-height aspect ratio (~0.5-1), a
hitherto unreported feature of epitaxial Ge growth on Si surfaces. In addition,
stacking fault and faceting are observed in islands as small as 5 nm diameter.
Ge islands, not even in contact with the Si substrate, appear to be in
epitaxial alignment with the Si substrate. The island size distribution is
essentially monomodal. As the contact area of Ge islands with Si through the
voids in the oxide layer can be controlled via growth temperature, the results
indicate that tunability of the potential barrier at the interface and
consequently the tunability of electronic levels and optical properties can be
achieved by the control of growth temperature.

gamma ~ -(0.34 +/- 0.12) in average, although 5 FRED peaks show consistent
value of gamma = -1/2 which is expected in synchrotron or inverse-Compton

sufficient to evaluate the time-resolved spectra with precise energy response
matrices. Their behavior in spectral evolution suggests two different origins
of emissions. In the case of GRB081224, the derived 1-s time-resolved spectra
are well described by a blackbody radiation model with a power-law component.
The derived behavior of cooling is consistent with that expected from radiative
cooling or expansion of the emission region. On the other hand, the other 1-s
time-resolved spectra from GRB100707A is well described by a Band GRB model as
well as with the thermal model. Although relative poor statistics prevent us to
conclude, the energy dependence in decaying light curve is consistent with that

light and other quantum states of matter such as ultracold atoms or electrons.
The theoretical description of photon counting was derived in the 1960s and was
extended to massive particles more recently. Typically, the interaction between
each particle and the detector is assumed to be limited to short time
intervals, and the probability of counting particles in one interval is
independent of the measurements in previous intervals. There has been some
effort to describe particle counting as a continuous measurement, where the
detector and the field to be counted interact continuously. However, no general
formula applicable to any time and space dependent field has been derived so
far. In our work, we derive a fully time and space dependent description of the
counting process for linear quantum many-body systems, taking into account the
back-action of the detector on the field. We apply our formalism to an
expanding Bose-Einstein condensate of ultracold atoms, and show that it
describes the process correctly, whereas the standard approach gives unphysical
results in some limits. The example illustrates that in certain situations, the
back-action of the detector cannot be neglected and has to be included in the
description.

role of dust on the thermal and dynamical evolution of the first galaxies in
the presence of a background UV flux, and its implications for the
observability of Lyman alpha emitters and sub-mm sources. We have performed
high resolution cosmological simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement
code FLASH to accomplish this goal. We have developed a chemical network
appropriate for these conditions and coupled it with the FLASH code. The main
ingredients of our chemical model include the formation of molecules, a
multi-level treatment of atomic hydrogen, line trapping of Lyman alpha photons
and, photoionization and photodissociation processes in a UV background. We
found that the formation of molecules (H_{2} and HD) is significantly enhanced
in the presence of dust grains. The presence of a background UV flux strongly
influences the formation of molecules by photodissociating them. We explore the
evolution after a major merger, leading to the formation of a binary disk.
These disks have gas masses of ~10^{7} M_sun at a redshift of 5.4. Each disk
lies in a separate subhalo as a result of the merger event. The disks are
supported by turbulent pressure due to the highly supersonic turbulence present
in the halo. The presence of dust does not significantly reduce the Lyman alpha
emission. The emission of Lyman alpha is extended and originates from the
envelope of the halo due to line trapping effects. We also find that dust
masses of 10^8 M_sun are required to observe the dust continuum emission from z

concepts of wave-particle duality and matter waves in the year 1923. The
commonly admitted quantum energy or frequency expression h{\nu}={\gamma}mc2 is
shown to be inappropriate for matter waves and is acceptable only for photons.
The superluminal phase velocity expression c2/\u{psion}, for matter waves, is
investigated in detail and is also reported to be inadequate. The
rectifications in the inadequate concepts of de Broglie's theory and
refinements in the analogy implementation between light waves and matter waves
are presented, which provides the modified frequency and phase velocity
expression for matter waves. Mathematical proofs for the proposed modified
frequency and phase velocity expression are also presented. In accordance with
the proposed concepts, a wave-particle duality picture is presented which
elucidates the questions coupled with the wave-particle duality, existing in
the literature. Consequently, particle type nature is shown to be a
characteristic of waves only, independent from the presence of matter. The
modifications introduced in the frequency expression for matter waves leads to
variation in the wave function expression for a freely moving particle and its
energy operators, with appropriate justifications. A new relation between the
Kinetic energy and Momentum of the moving body is proposed and is subsequently
applied to introduce novel General and Relativistic Quantum Mechanical Wave
Equations. Applications of these equations in bound state quantum mechanical
systems provide the information regarding particle's general and relativistic
behavior in such systems. Moreover, the proposed wave equations can also be
transformed into Schr\""odinger's and Dirac's equations. The interrelation of

We prove that the relative Chow motive R(X/S) has a canonical decomposition as
a direct sum of motives R^(\xi)$ where \xi runs over an explicitly determined
finite set of irreducible representations of the group D^{opp,*}, such that
R^(\xi), seen as a functor from Chow motives to D^{\opp,*}-representations, is
\xi-isotypic. Our decomposition refines the motivic decomposition of Deninger
and Murre, as well as Beauville's decomposition of the Chow group.
  The second main result is that we construct a canonical generalized motivic
Lefschetz decomposition. Inspired by work of Looijenga and Lunts, the role of
sl_2 in the classical theory is here replaced by a larger Lie algebra,
generated by all Lefschetz and Lambda operators associated to non-degenerate
line bundles. We construct an action of this larger Lie algebra on R(X/S) and
deduce from this a generalized Lefschetz decomposition. We also give a precise
structure result for the Lefschetz components that arise.
  As an application of our techniques, we provide a positive answer to a
question of Claire Voisin concerning the analogue for abelian varieties of a
conjecture of Beauville.

the LSND Collaboration's data analysis will be questioned, rendering a further

To appear in Physical Review C",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.84.054914",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have examined the production of J/$\psi$ mesons in high energy
proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at beam energies in the range from
158 GeV to 920 GeV, available from different fixed target experiments. In the
employed model J/$\psi$ production in hadronic collisions is assumed to be a
factorisable two step process: (i) production of a $c\bar{c}$ pair which can be
reliably described by perturbative QCD, and (ii) formation of J/$\psi$
resonance from the $c\bar{c}$ pair, which can be conveniently parameterized
incorporating different existing physical mechanisms of color neutralization.
We show that, for lower collision energies, J/$\psi$ production through
quark-anti-quark annihilation gives larger contribution at higher $x_F$, while
gluon-gluon fusion dominates the production at smaller $x_F$. For
proton-nucleus collisions the model takes into account both the initial state
modification of parton distributions in nuclei and the final state interaction
of the produced $c\bar{c}$ pairs with the target nucleons. The model is found
to give reasonable description of data on J/$\psi$ production in protonic and
proton-nucleus collisions, for different existing fixed target experiments. In
case of proton-nucleus collisions, our calculations show a non-negligible
dependence of the final state nuclear dissociation of J/$\psi$ mesons on the
energy of the incident proton beam. The model has been applied to predict the
J/$\psi$ production and suppression expected in proton-nucleus collisions at
energies relevant to FAIR, the upcoming accelerator facility at Darmstadt,
Germany. The amount of suppressions, for different mechanisms of J/$\psi$
hadronization has been found to be distinguishably different which might help
an experimental settlement of the much controversial issue of color
neutralization.

presence of extra radiation beyond the standard model expectation. In order to
test the robustness of these claims under different methods of constructing
parameter constraints, we perform a Bayesian posterior-based and a likelihood
profile-based analysis of current data. We confirm the presence of a slight
discrepancy between posterior- and profile-based constraints, with the
marginalised posterior preferring higher values of the effective number of
neutrino species N_eff. This can be traced back to a volume effect occurring
during the marginalisation process, and we demonstrate that the effect is
related to the fact that cosmic microwave background (CMB) data constrain N_eff
only indirectly via the redshift of matter-radiation equality. Once present CMB
data are combined with external information about, e.g., the Hubble parameter,
the difference between the methods becomes small compared to the uncertainty of
N_eff. We conclude that the preference of precision cosmological data for
excess radiation is ""real"" and not an artifact of a specific choice of
credible/confidence interval construction.

operator mediating the scattering, can be extracted. Taking into account
realization (Poisson) noise, a single target nucleus with 300 events has
limited power to discriminate operators with momentum dependence differing by
q^\pm2 for a wide range of dark matter masses from 10 GeV to 1 TeV. With the
inclusion of multiple targets (or a factor of several more events on a single
target), the discrimination of operators with different momentum dependence
becomes very strong at the 95% C.L. for dark matter candidates of mass 50 GeV
and above. On the other hand, operator discrimination remains poor for 10 GeV
candidates until multiple experiments each collect 1000 or more events.

derivations, and their linear algebraic properties. In particular, for k = 1, 2
we show that measures on k-dimensional Euclidean space that induce rank-k
modules of derivations must be absolutely continuous to Lebesgue measure. An
analogous result holds true for measures concentrated on k-rectifiable sets
with respect to k-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
  Though formulated for Euclidean spaces, these rigidity results also apply to
the metric space setting and specifically, to spaces that support a doubling
measure and a p-Poincar\'e inequality. Using our results for the Euclidean
plane, we prove the 2-dimensional case of a conjecture of Cheeger, which
concerns the non-degeneracy of Lipschitz images of such spaces.

subcube of $\{0,1\}^d$ is a subset of $2^k$ of its points formed by fixing $k$
coordinates and allowing the remaining $d-k$ to vary freely. The subcube
structure of the discrete cube is surprisingly complicated and there are many
open questions relating to it.
  This paper is concerned with patterns of intersections among subcubes of the
discrete cube. Two sample questions along these lines are as follows: given a
family of subcubes in which no $r+1$ of them have non-empty intersection, how
many pairwise intersections can we have? How many subcubes can we have if among
them there are no $k$ which have non-empty intersection and no $l$ which are
pairwise disjoint? These questions are naturally expressed as Tur\'an and
Ramsey type questions in intersection graphs of subcubes where the intersection
graph of a family of sets has one vertex for each set in the family with two
vertices being adjacent if the corresponding subsets intersect.
  Tur\'an and Ramsey type problems are at the heart of extremal combinatorics
and so these problems are mathematically natural. However, a second motivation
is a connection with some questions in social choice theory arising from a
simple model of agreement in a society. Specifically, if we have to make a
binary choice on each of $n$ separate issues then it is reasonable to assume
that the set of choices which are acceptable to an individual will be
represented by a subcube. Consequently, the pattern of intersections within a
family of subcubes will have implications for the level of agreement within a
society.
  We pose a number of questions and conjectures relating directly to the
Tur\'an and Ramsey problems as well as raising some further directions for
study of subcube intersection graphs.

  verification and generation; 39 proof files. Revised to include stability
  theorems",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  If $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of graphs then the Tur\'an density of
$\mathcal{F}$ is determined by the minimum chromatic number of the members of
$\mathcal{F}$.
  The situation for Tur\'an densities of 3-graphs is far more complex and still
very unclear. Our aim in this paper is to present new exact Tur\'an densities
for individual and finite families of 3-graphs, in many cases we are also able
to give corresponding stability results. As well as providing new examples of
individual 3-graphs with Tur\'an densities equal to 2/9,4/9,5/9 and 3/4 we also
give examples of irrational Tur\'an densities for finite families of 3-graphs,
disproving a conjecture of Chung and Graham. (Pikhurko has independently
disproved this conjecture by a very different method.)
  A central question in this area, known as Tur\'an's problem, is to determine
the Tur\'an density of $K_4^{(3)}=\{123,124, 134, 234\}$. Tur\'an conjectured
that this should be 5/9. Razborov [On 3-hypergraphs with forbidden 4-vertex
configurations, in SIAM J. Disc. Math. 24 (2010), 946-963] showed that if we
consider the induced Tur\'an problem forbidding $K_4^{(3)}$ and $E_1$, the
3-graph with 4 vertices and a single edge, then the Tur\'an density is indeed
5/9. We give some new non-induced results of a similar nature, in particular we
show that $\pi(K_4^{(3)},H)=5/9$ for a 3-graph $H$ satisfying $\pi(H)=3/4$.
  We end with a number of open questions focusing mainly on the topic of which
values can occur as Tur\'an densities.
  Our work is mainly computational, making use of Razborov's flag algebra
framework. However all proofs are exact in the sense that they can be verified
without the use of any floating point operations. Indeed all verifying
computations use only integer operations, working either over $\mathbb{Q}$ or
in the case of irrational Tur\'an densities over an appropriate quadratic
extension of $\mathbb{Q}$.

interferometric measurements as well. The multiple baseline data directly probe
the radial distribution of the material on sub-pc scales. Within our sample,
which is small but spans over ~2.5 orders of magnitudes in the UV/optical
luminosity L of the central engine, the radial distribution clearly and
systematically changes with luminosity. First, we show that the brightness
distribution at a given mid-IR wavelength seems to be rather well described by
a power law, which makes a simple Gaussian or ring size estimation quite
inadequate. Here we instead use a half-light radius R_1/2 as a representative
size. We then find that the higher luminosity objects become more compact in
normalized half-light radii R_1/2 /R_in in the mid-IR, where R_in is the dust
sublimation radius empirically given by the L^1/2 fit of the near-IR
reverberation radii. This means that, contrary to previous studies, the
physical mid-IR emission size (e.g. in pc) is not proportional to L^1/2, but
increases with L much more slowly, or in fact, nearly constant at 13 micron.
Combining the size information with the total flux specta, we infer that the
radial surface density distribution of the heated dust grains changes from a
steep ~r^-1 structure in high luminosity objects to a shallower ~r^0 structure
in those of lower luminosity. The inward dust temperature distribution does not
seem to smoothly reach the sublimation temperature -- on the innermost scale of
~R_in, a relatively low temperature core seems to co-exist with a slightly
distinct brightness concentration emitting roughly at the sublimation
temperature.

multi-peak `inverted gravity-like' solitary waves are predicted. We also
demonstrate that the pulse dynamics shows the ejection of solitons during

solid-core fibers. Moreover, unconventional long-range non-local interactions
between temporally distant solitons, unique of gas plasma systems, are
predicted and studied. Finally, the effects of higher-order dispersion

distribution in plant tissues is critical for plant morphogenesis. We consider
a leading model of the polar auxin flux, and study in full detail the stability
of the possible equilibrium configurations. We show that the critical states of
the auxin transport process are composed of basic building blocks, which are
isolated in a background of auxin depleted cells, and are not geometrically
regular in general. The same model was considered recently through a continuous
limit and a coupling to the von Karman equations, to model the interplay of
biochemistry and mechanics during plant growth.
  Our conclusions might be of interest in this setting, since, for example, we
establish the existence of Lyapunov functions for the auxin flux, proving in
this way the convergence of pure transport processes toward the set of critical
configurations.

  Orthogonal Forward Regression","12 pages, pre-print",,,,"stat.ML stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Echo state network (ESN) is viewed as a temporal non-orthogonal expansion
with pseudo-random parameters. Such expansions naturally give rise to
regressors of various relevance to a teacher output. We illustrate that often
only a certain amount of the generated echo-regressors effectively explain the
variance of the teacher output and also that sole local regularization is not
able to provide in-depth information concerning the importance of the generated
regressors. The importance is therefore determined by a joint calculation of
the individual variance contributions and Bayesian relevance using locally
regularized orthogonal forward regression (LROFR) algorithm. This information
can be advantageously used in a variety of ways for an in-depth analysis of an
ESN structure and its state-space parameters in relation to the unknown
dynamics of the underlying problem. We present locally regularized linear
readout built using LROFR. The readout may have a different dimensionality than
an ESN model itself, and besides improving robustness and accuracy of an ESN it
relates the echo-regressors to different features of the training data and may
determine what type of an additional readout is suitable for a task at hand.
Moreover, as flexibility of the linear readout has limitations and might
sometimes be insufficient for certain tasks, we also present a radial basis
function (RBF) readout built using LROFR. It is a flexible and parsimonious
readout with excellent generalization abilities and is a viable alternative to
readouts based on a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) or an RBF net built
using relevance vector machine (RVM).

French-Italian station, Concordia, at Dome C, Antarctica. We also present some
solutions to the challenges of operating in the harsh polar environ- ment. Dome
C offers exceptional conditions in terms of absolute atmospheric transmission
and stability for submillimetre astron- omy. Over the austral winter the PWV
exhibits long periods during which it is stable and at a very low level (0.1 to
0.3 mm). Higher values (0.2 to 0.8 mm) of PWV are observed during the short
summer period. Based on observations over three years, a transmission of around
50% at 350 um is achieved for 75% of the time. The 200-um window opens with a
typical transmission of 10% to 15% for 25% of the time. Dome C is one of the
best accessible sites on Earth for submillimetre astronomy. Observations at 350
or 450 {\mu}m are possible all year round, and the 200-um window opens long
enough and with a sufficient transparency to be useful. Although the polar
environment severely constrains hardware design, a permanent observatory with
appropriate technical capabilities is feasible. Because of the very good
astronomical conditions, high angular resolution and time series (multi-year)
observations at Dome C with a medium size single dish telescope would enable
unique studies to be conducted, some of which are not otherwise feasible even

networks and aims to predict the size of contagion events. In contrast to
previous work on random financial networks, which assumes independent
connections between banks, the possibility of disassortative edge probabilities
(an above average tendency for small banks to link to large banks) is
explicitly incorporated. We give a probabilistic analysis of the default
cascade triggered by shocking the network. We find that the cascade can be
understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge probabilities that
converges to a fixed point. A cascade condition is derived that characterizes
whether or not an infinitesimal shock to the network can grow to a finite size
cascade, in analogy to the basic reproduction number $R_0$ in epidemic
modeling. It provides an easily computed measure of the systemic risk inherent
in a given banking network topology. An analytic formula is given for the
frequency of global cascades, derived from percolation theory on the random
network. Two simple examples are used to demonstrate that edge-assortativity
can have a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the
cascade condition. Although the analytical methods are derived for infinite
networks, large-scale Monte Carlo simulations are presented that demonstrate
the applicability of the results to finite-sized networks. Finally, we propose
a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call ""graph-assortativity"", that
seems to best capture systemic risk.

  original file",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The slinky, released from rest hanging under its own weight, falls in a
peculiar manner. The bottom stays at rest until a wave hits it from above. Two
cases -- one unphysical one where the slinky is able to pass through itself,
and the other where the coils of the slinky collide creating a shock wave
travelling down the slinky -- are analysed. In the former case, the bottom
begins to move much later than in the latter.

the background of FRW model of the universe. The interaction is chosen either
in linear combination or in product form of the matter densities for dark
matter and dark energy. The IR cut off for holographic dark energy is chosen as
Ricci's length scale or radius of the future event horizon. The analysis is
done using the state finder parameter and coincidence problem has been
graphically presented. Finally, universal thermodynamics has been studied using
state finder parameters.

Woodruff","An optical mechanism for aberration of starlight",,"JOSA A, Vol. 29, Issue 7, pp. 1217-1223 (2012)","10.1364/JOSAA.29.001217",,"astro-ph.IM physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a physical-optics based theory of the physical mechanism for
aberration of starlight. We apply non-relativistic and relativistic theories
for wavefront image formation and include the effects of optically transmitting
media within the sensor. We show that the sensors imaging properties combined
with finite velocity of light fully accounts for aberration. That is, the
influence of the moving sensor on the incident wavefront from the star fully
explains aberration. Our treatment differs from all previous derivations
because we include wavefront-imaging physics within the sensor model. Our
predictions match Earth-sensor based measurements, but differ at larger sensor
speeds from predictions of the special relativistic-based theory. While
experimental uncertainty resulting from the low Earth-orbital velocity prevents
experimental confirmation of the special relativistic model of aberration, we
find that Earth-based sensors containing refractive optical media could
experimentally differentiate between these competing descriptions and, in
addition, yield an independent test of time dilation. We derive and present the
details of such an experiment.

  Finite Fields",,,,,"cs.SC cs.CR math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Root extraction is a classical problem in computers algebra. It plays an
essential role in cryptosystems based on elliptic curves. In 2006, Barreto and
Voloch proposed an algorithm to compute $r$th roots in ${F}_{q^m} $ for certain
choices of $m$ and $q$. If $r\,||\,q-1$ and $ (m, r)=1, $ they proved that the
complexity of their method is $\widetilde{\mathcal {O}}(r(\log m+\log\log
q)m\log q) $. In this paper, we extend the Barreto-Voloch algorithm to the
general case that $r\,||\,q^m-1$, without the restrictions $r\,||\,q-1$ and
$(m, r)=1 $. We also specify the conditions that the Barreto-Voloch algorithm
can be preferably applied.

with separate analyticity theorems in several complex variables and some open
problems are also mentioned.
