nanomagnets such as \Fe8. In this process the spin tunnels from the lowest
state near one easy direction to the first excited state near the opposite easy
direction, and subsequently decays to the second easy direction with the
emission of a phonon, or it first emits a phonon and then tunnels to the final
state. This mechanism is the simplest imaginable one that allows magnetization
relaxation in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field that is so large
that the nuclear spin environment cannot absorb the energy required for energy
conservation to hold. It is proposed as a way of understanding both
magnetization realaxation and Landau-Zener-St\""uckelberg experiments. The
requisite Fermi golden rule rate, and the spin-flip rates are calculated, and
it is found that these rates are much too low by several orders of magnitude.
Thus the understanding of magnetic relaxation in the experiments remains an
open question.

technique is robust to changes in its parameter values. To evaluate our
proposed system, we implemented CellSense on Android-based phones. Results from
two different testbeds, represent- ing urban and rural environments, for three
differ- ent cellular providers show that CellSense provides at least 108.57%
enhancement in accuracy in rural areas and at least 89.03% in urban areas

In additional, the proposed hybrid technique provides more than 6 times and 5.4

RSSI-based GSM localization systems for the rural and urban testbeds
respectively.We also evaluate the effect of changing the different system

In the fluid dynamics videos, we describe in detail the three-dimensional

heart and becomes inclined. The trailing secondary vortex tubes are formed as
the result of interaction between the vortex ring and the LV wall. These vortex
tubes wrap around the circumference and begin to interact with and destabilize
the mitral vortex ring. At the end of diastole, the vortex ring impinges on the
LV wall and the large-scale intraventricular flow rotates in clockwise
direction. We show for the first time that the mitral vortex ring evolution is
dominated by a number of vortex-vortex and vortex-wall interactions, including
lateral straining and deformation of vortex ring, the interaction of two vortex
tubes with unequal strengths, helicity polarization of vortex tubes and
twisting instabilities of the vortex cores.

many potential applications the total number of measurement bits is
constrained, which suggests a tradeoff between the number of measurements and
the number of bits per measurement. We study this situation in this paper and
show that there exist two distinct regimes of operation that correspond to
high/low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the measurement compression (MC)
regime, a high SNR favors acquiring fewer measurements with more bits per
measurement; in the quantization compression (QC) regime, a low SNR favors
acquiring more measurements with fewer bits per measurement. A surprise from
our analysis and experiments is that in many practical applications it is
better to operate in the QC regime, even acquiring as few as 1 bit per

the dynamics of a few-photon superposed (e.g., up to two ones) state in a
dissipating cavity. It is shown that, the negativity of the Wigner function of
the photonic state unquestionably vanishes with the cavity's dissipation. As a
consequence, the nonclassical effects related to the negativity of the Wigner
function should be weakened gradually. However, it is found that the value of
the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ (which serves usually as the
standard criterion of a typical nonclassical effect, i.e., $g^{(2)}(0)<1$
implies that the photon is anti-bunching) is a dynamical invariant during the
dissipative process of the cavity. This feature is also proven analytically and
suggests that $g^{(2)}(0)$ might not be a good physical parameter to describe
the photonic decays. Alternatively, we find that the anti-normal-order
correlation function $g^{(2A)}(0)$ changes with the cavity's dissipation and
thus is more suitable to describe the dissipative-dependent cavity. Finally, we
propose an experimental approach to test the above arguments with a
practically-existing cavity QED system.

multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems to discriminate the channel estimation
performances between a legitimate receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver
(UR). This thesis extends upon the previously proposed discriminatory channel
estimation (DCE) scheme that allows only the transmitter to send training
signals. The goal of DCE is to minimize the channel estimation error at LR
while requiring the channel estimation error at UR to remain beyond a certain
level. If the training signal is sent only by the transmitter, the performance
discrimination between LR and UR will be limited since the training signals
help both receivers perform estimates of their downlink channels. In this work,
we consider instead the two-way training methodology that allows both the
transmitter and LR to send training signals. In this case, the training signal
sent by LR helps the transmitter obtain knowledge of the transmitter-to-LR
channel, but does not help UR estimate its downlink channel (i.e., the
transmitter-to-UR channel). With transmitter knowledge of the estimated
transmitter-to-LR channel, artificial noise (AN) can then be embedded in the
null space of the transmitter-to-LR channel to disrupt UR's channel estimation
without severely degrading the channel estimation at LR. Based on these ideas,
two-way DCE training schemes are developed for both reciprocal and
non-reciprocal channels. The optimal power allocation between training and AN
signals is devised under both average and individual power constraints.
Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
two-way DCE training schemes.

quantifying the amount of risk underestimation and return overestimation of
improved portfolio constructions beyond standard ones. Well-known for the
latter, if not corrected, these deviations lead to inaccurate and overly
optimistic Sharpe-based investment decisions. Our results are based on recent
contributions in the field of random matrix theory. Along with the asymptotic

This implies that any change to the implementation structure may cause a
rippling effect. Sometimes this unduly restricts the scope of software
evolution, in particular for methods with multiple parameters where there is no
clear owner. We propose a simple scheme where symmetric methods may be defined
in the classes of any of their parameters. This allows client code to be
oblivious of what class contains a method implementation, and therefore immune
against it changing. When combined with multiple dynamic dispatch, this scheme
allows for modular extensibility where a method defined in one class is
overridden by a method defined in a class that is not its subtype. In this

the dc conductance can be used to obtain additional information, with a
density-dependent Land\'{e} effective g-factor recently reported [T.-M. Chen et

measurements of quantum point contacts, demonstrating how valuable additional

general framework for dc conductance measurements that provides a path to
improving the accuracy of existing data and obtaining useful additional data. A
key aspect is that dc conductance measurements can be used to map the energy of
the 1D subband edges directly, giving new insight into the physics that takes
place as the spin-split 1D subbands populate. Through a re-analysis of the data
obtained by Chen et al, we obtain two findings. The first is that the 2-down
subband edge closely tracks the source chemical potential when it first begins
populating before dropping more rapidly in energy. The second is that the 2-up
subband populates more rapidly as the subband edge approaches the drain
potential. This second finding suggests that the spin-gap may stop opening, or
even begin to close again, as the 2-up subband continues populating, consistent
with recent theoretical calculations and experimental studies.

the interaction of a deuteron beam with a target of deuterated metal Ta. In
these experiments, the reaction cross section for d(d,p)t was shown to be
orders of magnitude greater than what the conventional model predicts for the
low-energy particles. In this paper we take into account the influence of
quantum effects due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for particles in a
non-ideal medium elastically interacting with the medium particles. In order to
calculate the nuclear reaction rate in the non-ideal environment we apply both
the Monte Carlo technique and approximate analytical calculation of the Feynman
diagram using nonrelativistic kinetic Green's functions in the medium which
correspond to the generalized energy and momentum distribution functions of
interacting particles. We show a possibility to reduce the 12-fold integral
corresponding to this diagram to a fivefold integral. This can significantly
speed up the computation and control accuracy. Our calculations show that
quantum effects significantly influence reaction rates such as p +7Be, 3He
+4He, p +7Li, and 12C +12C. The new reaction rates may be much higher than the
classical ones for the interior of the Sun and supernova stars. The possibility
to observe the theoretical predictions under laboratory conditions is

this behavior may have been due to the limited dynamical range of those

three cosmological epochs to provide a calibration for the velocity-dependent
one-scale model for domain walls: we numerically determine the two free model

induce either current-driven {\em magnetization switching} from in-plane to

possible to control the magnetization steady state and dynamics by either
varying the bias voltage or electrically modifying the SOI at the interface.

operator and evolution of its potential are the basic ingredients, similar to
the existing methods developed by Gardner-Greene-Kruskal-Miura (1967),
Zacharov-Shabbath (1974) and Peter Lax (1977). Evolutionary KdV vessel may be
considered as a generalization of these previous works. The advantage of the
new method is that it produces a unified approach to existing solutions of the
KdV equation. For example, odd or even analytic, periodic, almost periodic
solutions are shown to be particular cases of this theory. Generalizing this
method we can also produce many PDEs, associated with integrable systems, in an
arbitrary number of variables (in the spirit of Zakarov-Shabat).

into the water and forms air pockets. These air pockets eventually break up
into small bubbles, which travel downstream to form a bubbly wake. To better
understand the underlying flow physics involved in the bubble entrainment, in
the linked videos, air entrainment due to a water jet plunging onto a pool of
stationary water was numerically studied by using the 3DYNAFS software suit.
  The flow field is simulated by directly solving the Navier-Stokes equations
through the viscous module, 3DYNAFS-VIS, using a level set method for capturing
the free surface. The breakup of entrained air pockets and the resulting bubbly
flow were modeled by coupling 3DYNAFS-VIS with a Lagrangian multi-bubble
tracking model, 3DYNAFS-DSM (Hsiao & Chahine, 2003), which emits bubbles into
the liquid according to local liquid/gas interface flow conditions based on the
sub-grid air entrainment modeling proposed by Ma et al. (2011), and tracks all
bubbles in the liquid flow using equations of motion and bubble dynamics.
Further breakup of the dispersed bubbles into smaller ones is modeled by
incorporating the bubble breakup model developed by Martinez-Bazan et al.
(1999). The software was parallelized by using a hybrid MPI-OpenMP scheme.
  The video describes the impinging of a water jet with a diameter of 4 cm at a
velocity of 4 m/s, the entrainment and breakup of the air pockets accompanied
by strong production and interaction with vorticity structures, and the
subsequent bubbly flows. This video has been submitted to the Gallery of Fluid
Motion 2011, which is an annual showcase of fluid dynamics videos.
