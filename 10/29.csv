which the right-handed neutrinos from the seesaw mechanism can be both keV warm
dark matter particles and eV-scale sterile neutrinos. This is achieved by
giving the right-handed neutrinos appropriate charges under the same
Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry responsible for the hierarchy of the charged lepton
masses. We discuss the effect of next-to-leading order corrections to deviate
the zeroth order tri-bimaximal mixing. Those corrections have two sources: (i)
higher order seesaw terms, which are important when the seesaw particles are
eV-scale, and (ii) higher-dimensional effective operators suppressed by
additional powers of the cut-off scale of the theory. Whereas the mixing angles
of the active neutrinos typically receive corrections of the same order, the
mixing of the sterile neutrinos with the active ones is rather stable as it is
connected with a hierarchy of mass scales. We also modify an effective A_4
model to incorporate keV-scale sterile neutrinos.

sets of key variables of a CNF formula F that make it easy to solve the
formula; by assigning truth values to the variables in a backdoor set, the
formula gets reduced to one or several polynomial-time solvable formulas. More
specifically, a weak backdoor set of F is a set X of variables such that there
exits a truth assignment t to X that reduces F to a satisfiable formula F[t]
that belongs to a polynomial-time decidable base class C. A strong backdoor set
is a set X of variables such that for all assignments t to X, the reduced
formula F[t] belongs to C.
  We study the problem of finding backdoor sets of size at most k with respect
to the base class of CNF formulas with acyclic incidence graphs, taking k as
the parameter. We show that
  1. the detection of weak backdoor sets is W[2]-hard in general but
fixed-parameter tractable for r-CNF formulas, for any fixed r>=3, and
  2. the detection of strong backdoor sets is fixed-parameter approximable.
  Result 1 is the the first positive one for a base class that does not have a
characterization with obstructions of bounded size. Result 2 is the first
positive one for a base class for which strong backdoor sets are more powerful
than deletion backdoor sets.
  Not only SAT, but also #SAT can be solved in polynomial time for CNF formulas
with acyclic incidence graphs. Hence Result 2 establishes a new structural
parameter that makes #SAT fixed-parameter tractable and that is incomparable
with known parameters such as treewidth and clique-width.
  We obtain the algorithms by a combination of an algorithmic version of the
Erd\""os-P\'osa Theorem, Courcelle's model checking for monadic second order
logic, and new combinatorial results on how disjoint cycles can interact with
the backdoor set.

Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The strong pulsed X-ray source was discovered with the
Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories. The X-ray pulse period of 1062 s is
consistently determined from both Chandra and XMM-Newton observations,
revealing one of the slowest rotating X-ray pulsars known in the SMC. The
optical counterpart of the X-ray source is the emission-line star 2dFS 3831.
Its B0-0.5(III)e+ spectral type is determined from VLT-FLAMES and 2dF optical
spectroscopy, establishing the system as a Be/X-ray binary (Be-XRB). The hard
X-ray spectrum is well fitted by a power-law with additional thermal and
blackbody components, the latter reminiscent of persistent Be-XRBs. This system
is the first evidence of a recent supernova in the low density surroundings of
NGC 602. We detect a shell nebula around 2dFS 3831 in H-alpha and [O III]
images and conclude that it is most likely a supernova remnant. If it is linked
to the supernova explosion that created this new X-ray pulsar, its kinematic
age of (2-4)x10^4 yr provides a constraint on the age of the pulsar.

speed of muon neutrinos travelling through the Earth's crust between their
production site at CERN and their detection site under Gran Sasso, ~730 km
away. The measurement was based on the assumption that the pulse shape of the
neutrinos from the decay of parent mesons produced in proton-target collisions
is the same as that of the incident protons. Here we argue that the effective
column density of the target along the beam direction decreases with time
during the 10.5 microseconds duration of the proton pulse. This is because of
the thermal expansion and expulsion of target material along the beam by the
energy-momentum deposition during the 10.5 microseconds pulse. The progresive
reduction in the effective column density during the pulse decreases the
neutrino production rate per incident proton. It could have advanced the mean
production time of the detected neutrinos relative to that calculated from the
proton pulse-shape, by an amount comparable to the measured neutrino lead time
(60.7+/-6.9(stat) +/-7.4(sys) ns. This explanation implies that the planned
measurements by OPERA of the speed of neutrinos produced in much shorter (a few
ns) pulses, should yield a speed consistent with the speed of light in free
space.

presents similar theoretical performances as the celebrated local-polynomial
estimator (LPE). In addition, it benefits from the lattice structure of the
underlying MRA and thus outperforms the LPE from a computational standpoint,
which turns out to be a crucial feature in many practical applications.
Finally, we prove that the associated plug-in classifier can reach super-fast
rates under a margin assumption.

form by subsequent collisions of pre-planetesimals of sizes from centimetre to
hundreds of metres. Pre-planetesimals are fluffy, porous dust aggregates, which
are inhomogeneous owing to their collisional history. Planetesimal growth can
be prevented by catastrophic disruption in pre-planetesimal collisions above
the destruction velocity threshold. We develop an inhomogeneity model based on
the density distribution of dust aggregates, which is assumed to be a Gaussian
distribution with a well-defined standard deviation. As a second input
parameter, we consider the typical size of an inhomogeneous clump. These input
parameters are easily accessible by laboratory experiments. For the simulation
of the dust aggregates, we utilise a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code
with extensions for modelling porous solid bodies. The porosity model was
previously calibrated for the simulation of silica dust, which commonly serves
as an analogue for pre-planetesimal material. The inhomogeneity is imposed as
an initial condition on the SPH particle distribution. We carry out collisions
of centimetre-sized dust aggregates of intermediate porosity. We vary the
standard deviation of the inhomogeneous distribution at fixed typical clump
size. The collision outcome is categorised according to the four-population
model. We show that inhomogeneous pre-planetesimals are more prone to
destruction than homogeneous aggregates. Even slight inhomogeneities can lower
the threshold for catastrophic disruption. For a fixed collision velocity, the
sizes of the fragments decrease with increasing inhomogeneity.
Pre-planetesimals with an active collisional history tend to be weaker. This is
a possible obstacle to collisional growth and needs to be taken into account in
future studies of the coagulation scenario.

Median stacking enables the first comprehensive study of very faint high-z
galaxies at multiple redshifts (e.g., [3.6] = 27.4 +/- 0.1 AB mag for the
M_1500 ~ -18 sources at z ~ 4). At z ~ 4 our faint median-stacked SEDs reach to
~ 0.06 L*(z=4) and are combined with recently published results at high

template fits to derive rest frame UV-to-optical colors (U - V) at all
redshifts and luminosities. We find that this color does not vary significantly
with redshift at a fixed luminosity. The UV-to-optical color does show a weak
trend with luminosity, becoming redder at higher luminosities. This is most
likely due to dust. At z >~ 5 we find blue colors [3.6]-[4.5] ~ -0.3 mag that
are most likely due to rest-frame optical emission lines contributing to the
flux in the IRAC filter bandpasses. The scatter across our derived SEDs remains
substantial, but the results are most consistent with a lack of any evolution
in the SEDs with redshift at a given luminosity. The similarity of the SEDs
suggests a self-similar mode of evolution over a timespan from 0.7 Gyr to 1.5

galaxies within 2\timesr200 and with masses >1.34\times10^11 Msun, and use two
comparison clusters at z=0 and z=1 of similar mass. We estimate the radial
profiles of the fraction of blue galaxies, taking into account the star aging

we find no evidence for a Butcher-Oemler effect between z~2.2 and z~0 for
galaxies more massive than 1.34\times10^11 Msun. In the cluster center, a
change greater than \Deltafblue/\Deltaz=0.16 between z~0 and z~2.2 would be

radial behaviour of EW[Halpha], u-i colour and emission line ratios. Although
EW[Halpha] and u-i colour trace current or recent star formation, the radial
profiles are often quite different. Whilst line ratios do vary with annular
radius, radial gradients in galaxies with central line ratios typical of AGN or
LINERS are mild, with a hard component of ionization required out to large
radii. We use our VIMOS maps to quantify the fraction of Halpha emission
contained within the SDSS fibre, taking the ratio of total Halpha flux to that
of a simulated SDSS fibre. A comparison of the flux ratios to colour-based SDSS
extrapolations shows a 175% dispersion in the ratio of estimated to actual
corrections in normal star forming galaxies, with larger errors in galaxies
containing AGN. We find a strong correlation between indicators of nuclear
activity: galaxies with AGN-like line ratios and/or radio emission frequently

heating. Altogether, about half of the galaxies in our sample show no evidence

well-established V-A structure of the Standard Model weak interactions. We
revisit these interactions and survey constraints from low-energy probes
(neutron, nuclear, and pion decays) as well as collider searches. Currently,
the most stringent limit on scalar and tensor interactions arise from 0+ -> 0+
nuclear decays and the radiative pion decay pi -> e nu gamma, respectively. For
the future, we find that upcoming neutron beta decay and LHC measurements will
compete in setting the most stringent bounds. For neutron beta decay, we
demonstrate the importance of lattice computations of the neutron-to-proton
matrix elements to setting limits on these interactions, and provide the first
lattice estimate of the scalar charge and a new average of existing results for
the tensor charge. Data taken at the LHC is currently probing these
interactions at the 10^-2 level (relative to the standard weak interactions),
with the potential to reach the 10^-3 level. We show that, with some
theoretical assumptions, the discovery of a charged spin-0 resonance decaying
to an electron and missing energy implies a lower limit on the strength of
scalar interactions probed at low energy.

transition, associated with the creation or annihilation of an outlier, when an
eigenvalue $d_i$ of the deformation crosses a critical value $\pm 1$. This
transition happens on the scale $|d_i| - 1 \sim N^{-1/3}$. We allow the
eigenvalues $d_i$ of the deformation to depend on $N$ under the condition
$|\abs{d_i} - 1| \geq (\log N)^{C \log \log N} N^{-1/3}$. We make no
assumptions on the eigenvectors of the deformation. In the limit $N \to
\infty$, we identify the law of the outliers and prove that the non-outliers
close to the spectral edge have a universal distribution coinciding with that
of the extremal eigenvalues of a Gaussian matrix ensemble.
  A key ingredient in our proof is the \emph{isotropic local semicircle law},

understanding the mechanism underlying the spread of infection. When the
likelihood function for these models is expensive to evaluate, traditional
likelihood-based inference may be computationally intractable. Furthermore,
traditional inference may lead to poor parameter estimates and the fitted model
may not capture important biological characteristics of the observed data. We
propose a novel approach for resolving these issues that is inspired by recent
work in emulation and calibration for complex computer models. Our motivating
example is the gravity time series susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) model.
Our approach focuses on the characteristics of the process that are of
scientific interest. We find a Gaussian process approximation to the gravity
model using key summary statistics obtained from model simulations. We
demonstrate via simulated examples that the new approach is computationally
expedient, provides accurate parameter inference, and results in a good model
fit. We apply our method to analyze measles outbreaks in England and Wales in
two periods, the pre-vaccination period from 1944-1965 and the vaccination
period from 1966-1994. Based on our results, we are able to obtain important
scientific insights about the transmission of measles. In general, our method
is applicable to problems where traditional likelihood-based inference is
computationally intractable or produces a poor model fit. It is also an
alternative to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) when simulations from the
model are expensive.

  Aims: We are conducting a radial velocity survey of 164 bright G and K giant

host star evolution on the inner structure of planetary systems. In this paper
we present the spectroscopic atmospheric parameters (\Teff, \logg, $\xi$,

  Methods: We used high resolution and high S/N spectra to measure the
equivalent widths of many Fe{\sc\,i} and Fe{\sc\,ii} lines, which were used to
derive the atmospheric parameters by imposing local thermodynamic and
ionization equilibrium. The effective temperatures and metallicities were used,
along with stellar evolutionary tracks to determine the physical properties and

nearly every applied field of engineering, policy, and science. A severe lack
of information precludes our ability to determine a frequency of occurrence of
events or conditions that impact the decision; therefore, decision
uncertainties due to a severe lack of information cannot be characterized
probabilistically. To circumvent this problem, information gap (info-gap)
theory has been developed to explicitly recognize and quantify the implications
of information gaps in decision making. This paper presents a decision analysis
based on info-gap theory developed for a contaminant remediation scenario. The
analysis provides decision support in determining the fraction of contaminant
mass to remove from the environment in the presence of a lack of information
related to the contaminant mass flux into an aquifer. An info-gap uncertainty
model is developed to characterize uncertainty due to a lack of information
concerning the contaminant flux. The info-gap uncertainty model groups nested,
convex sets of functions defining contaminant flux over time based on their
level of deviation from a nominal contaminant flux. The nominal contaminant
flux defines a reasonable contaminant flux over time based on existing
information. A robustness function is derived to quantify the maximum level of
deviation from nominal that still ensures compliance for each decision. An
opportuneness function is derived to characterize the possibility of meeting a
desired contaminant concentration level. The decision analysis evaluates how
the robustness and opportuneness change as a function of time since remediation
and as a function of the fraction of contaminant mass removed.

The two reported gamma-ray peaks occurred near the beginning of two major

polarization maximum at millimeter wavelengths. Our very long baseline array
observations indicate that the two millimeter-wave flares originated in the
second of two features in the jet that are separated by >14pc. The simultaneity
of the peak of the higher-amplitude gamma-ray flare and the maximum in
polarization of the second jet feature implies that the gamma-ray and
millimeter-wave flares are cospatial and occur >14pc from the central engine.
We also associate two optical flares, accompanied by sharp polarization peaks,
with the two gamma-ray events. The multi-waveband behavior is most easily
explained if the gamma-rays arise from synchrotron self Compton scattering of
optical photons from the flares. We propose that flares are triggered by
interaction of moving plasma blobs with a standing shock.

Monte Carlo method to simulate time-dependent statistical characteristics of
growing cell populations. To benchmark performance, we compare simulation
results with steadystate and time-dependent analytical solutions for several
scenarios, including steadystate and time-dependent gene expression, and the
effects on population heterogeneity of cell growth, division, and DNA

sources of randomness excited by a pre-arranged signal. We first determine the
secret key capacity for such systems with one-way public messaging. We then
characterize a tradeoff between the secret key rate and exponential bounds on
the probability of key agreement failure and on the secrecy of the key
generated. We find that there is a fundamental tradeoff between reliability and
secrecy.
  We then explore this framework within the context of reciprocal wireless
channels. In this setting, the users transmit pre-arranged excitation signals
to each other. When the fading is Rayleigh, the observations of the users are
jointly Gaussian sources. We show that an on-off excitation signal with an
SNR-dependent duty cycle achieves the secret key capacity of this system.
Furthermore, we characterize a fundamental metric -- minimum energy per key bit
for reliable key generation -- and show that in contrast to conventional AWGN
channels, there is a non-zero threshold SNR that achieves the minimum energy
per key bit. The capacity achieving on-off excitation signal achieves the
minimum energy per key bit at any SNR below the threshold. Finally, we build
off our error exponent results to investigate the energy required to generate a
key using a finite block length. Again we find that on-off excitation signals
yield an improvement when compared to constant excitation signals. In addition

sterile neutrinos) for the thermal history of the early universe. In
particular, we consider sterile neutrinos with rest masses in the 100 MeV to
500 MeV range, with couplings to ordinary active neutrinos large enough to
guarantee thermal and chemical equilibrium at epochs in the early universe with
temperatures T > 1 GeV, but in a range to give decay lifetimes from seconds to
minutes. Such neutrinos would decouple early, with relic densities comparable
to those of photons, but decay out of equilibrium, with consequent prodigious
entropy generation prior to, or during, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Most of
the ranges of sterile neutrino rest mass and lifetime considered are at odds
with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) limits on the relativistic particle
contribution to energy density (e.g., as parameterized by N_eff). However, some
sterile neutrino parameters can lead to an acceptable N_eff. These parameter
ranges are accompanied by considerable dilution of the ordinary background
relic neutrinos, possibly an adverse effect on BBN, but sometimes fall in a
range which can explain measured neutrino masses in some particle physics
models. A robust signature of these sterile neutrinos would be a measured N_eff
not equal to 3 coupled with no cosmological signal for neutrino rest mass when
the detection thresholds for these probes are below laboratory-established
neutrino mass values, either as established by the atmospheric neutrino
oscillation scale or direct measurements with, e.g., KATRIN or neutrino-less
double beta decay experiments.

binaries in a stellar environment. By imposing conservation of total energy and
angular momentum in scattering experiments, we find the dissipation forces that
are exerted on the black holes by the stars, and thus obtain the decaying path
of the binary from the classical dynamical friction regime down to subparsec
scales. Our scheme lies between scattering experiments and N-body simulations.
While still resolving collisions between stars and black holes, it is fast
enough and allows to use a large enough number of particles to reach a smooth
and convergent result. We studied both an equal mass and a 10:1 mass ratio
binaries under various initial conditions. We show that while an equal mass
binary stalls at a nearly circular orbit, a runaway growth of eccentricity
occurs in the unequal mass case. This effect reduces the timescale for black
hole coalescence through gravitational radiation to well below the Hubble time,
even in spherical and gasless systems formed by dry mergers.

symmetric bat and a spherical ball is solved in the strict rigid approximation
for arbitrary values of the initial conditions. The friction during the impact
is assumed to satisfy the standard rules. When the only source of energy
dissipation is friction, the problem is fully solved by determining the
separation point between the bodies. It also follows that whatever the
character of any additional form of dissipation is, it only affects the ending
value of the net impulse I done by the normal force of the bat on the ball at
separation, but not the dynamical evolution with the value of I during the
shock process. A relation determining whether the contact points of the two
bodies slides between them or become at rest (to be pure rotation state) at the
end of the impact, is determined for the case of the purely frictional energy
dissipation. The solution is also generalized to include losses in addition to
the frictional ones and then applied to the description of experimental
measures of the scattering of a ball by a bat. The evaluations satisfactorily
reproduce the measured curves for the output center of mass and angular
velocities of the ball as functions of the scattering angle and the impact
parameter, respectively.

regime to the mixed-valent regime or vice-versa as a function of pressure or
doping. We study this crossover theoretically by employing the periodic
Anderson model within the framework of the dynamical mean field theory. Changes
occurring in the dynamics and transport across this crossover are highlighted.
As the valence is decreased (increased) relative to the Kondo lattice regime,
the Kondo resonance broadens significantly, while the lower (upper) Hubbard
band moves closer to the Fermi level. The resistivity develops a two peak
structure in the mixed valent regime: a low temperature coherence peak and a
high temperature 'Hubbard band' peak. These two peaks merge yielding a broad
shallow maximum upon decreasing the valence further. The optical conductivity,
likewise exhibits an unusual absorption feature (shoulder) in the deep
mid-infrared region, which grows in intensity with decreasing valence. The
involvement of the Hubbard bands in dc transport, and of the effective f-level
in the optical conductivity are shown to be responsible for the anomalous
transport properties. A two-band hybridization-gap model, which neglects
incoherent effects due to many-body scattering, commonly employed to understand
the optical response in these materials is shown to be inadequate, especially
in the mixed-valent regime. Comparison of theory with experiment carried out
for (a) dc resistivities of CeRhIn5, Ce2Ni3Si5, CeFeGe3 and YbIr2Si2; (b)

We observed the 1.2 mm continuum emission across the whole GMC using the
Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope Imaging Bolometer Array mounted on the
SEST. Observations have a spatial resolution of 0.2 pc and cover 1.8 deg\times
2.2 deg in the sky with a noise of 20 mJy/beam. We identify 201 clumps with

clumps is 1.2\times10^4 Msun, thus the efficiency in forming these clumps,
estimated as the ratio of the total clump mass to the total GMC mass, is 0.02.
The clump mass distribution for masses between 10 and 10^3 Msun is well-fitted
by a power law dN/dM proportional to M^-alpha, with a spectral mass index alpha

may have taken place less than ~200 Myr ago. Such a merger event would explain
the presence of the intermediate mass black hole and support a young stellar
population.

candidate (BHC) MAXI J1659-152 with the orbital period of 2.41 hours (shortest
among BHCs) in the 2010 outburst from 65 Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
observations and 8 simultaneous Swift and RXTE observations. According to the
definitions of the spectral states in Remillard & McClintock (2006), most of
the observations have been classified into the intermediate state. All the
X-ray broadband spectra can be modeled by a multi-color disk plus a power-law
with an exponential cutoff or a multi-color disk plus a Comptonization
component. During the initial phase of the outburst, a high energy cutoff was
visible at 30-40 keV. The innermost radius of the disk gradually decreased by a
factor of more than 3 from the onset of the outburst and reached a constant
value of 35 d_10 cos i^-1/2 km, where d_10 is the distance in units of 10 kpc
and $i$ is the inclination. The type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)
frequency varied from 1.6 Hz to 7.3 Hz in association with a change of the
innermost radius, while the innermost radius remained constant during the
type-B QPO detections at 1.6-4.1 Hz. Hence, we suggest that the origin of the
type-B QPOs is different from that of type-C QPOs, the latter of which would
originate from the disk truncation radius. Assuming the constant innermost
radius in the latter phase of the outburst as the innermost stable circular
orbit, the black hole mass in MAXI J1659-152 is estimated to be 3.6-8.0 M_solar
for a distance of 5.3-8.6 kpc and an inclination angle of 60-75 degrees.

original and in self-similar variables, we express the corresponding equations
as gradient flows with respect to a free energy functional including a singular

asymptotic behavior and inviscid limit of solutions are obtained in the space
$\mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ of probability measures with finite second
moments, without any smallness condition. Our results are based on the abstract
gradient flow theory developed in \cite{Ambrosio}. An important byproduct of
our results is that there is a unique, up to invariance and translations,
global in time self-similar solution with initial data in
$\mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, which was already obtained in
\textrm{\cite{Deslippe,Biler-Karch}} by different methods. Moreover, this
self-similar solution attracts all the dynamics in self-similar variables. The
crucial monotonicity property of the transport between measures in one
dimension allows to show that the singular logarithmic potential energy is
displacement convex. We also extend the results to gradient flow equations with
negative power-law locally integrable interaction potentials.

greater vertical extent to the simulation domain produce a gas distribution

potential (QP) in general Hamilton-Jacobi equation via commuting relations,
quantum canonical transformations and without the straight effect of wave
function. The interpretation of QP in terms of independent entity is discussed
along with the introduction of quantum kinetic energy. The method has been
extended to relativistic regime, and same results have been concluded.

data alone and BAO data alone are similar, so it is worthwhile to compare their
constraints on the property of dark energy. We apply the SNLS3 compilation of
472 SNe Ia data, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement of distance, the
cosmic microwave background radiation data from the WMAP7, and the Hubble
parameter data to study the effect of their different combinations on the
fittings of cosmological parameters in the modified holographic dark energy
model and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model. Neither BAO nor WMAP7 data
alone give good constraint on the equation of state parameter of dark energy,
but both WMAP7 data and BAO data help SNe Ia data break the degeneracies among
the model parameters, hence tighten the constraint on the variation of equation
of state parameter $w_a$, and WMAP7 data do the job a little better. Although
BAO and WMAP7 data provide reasonably good constraints on $\Omega_m$ and
$\Omega_k$, they are not able to constrain the dynamics of dark energy. On the
other hand, SNe Ia data do not provide good constraints on $\Omega_m$ and
$\Omega_k$, but they provide good constraint on the dynamics of dark energy,
especially the variation of the equation of state parameter of dark energy, so
we need to combine SNe Ia with BAO and WMAP7 data to probe the property of dark
energy. The addition of $H(z)$ data helps better constrain the geometry of the
Universe $\Omega_k$ and the property of dark energy. For the SNLS SNe Ia data,
the nuisance parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are consistent for all different
combinations of the above data, and their impacts on the fittings of
cosmological parameters are minimal. By fitting the data to different models,
$\Lambda$CDM model is still consistent with all the observational data.

a new type of problem which has the interesting property of having no
polynomial time solutions. Next we show that HPTSP is in the class NP by
demonstrating that local information about sub-routes is insufficient to
compute the complete value of each route. As a consequence, via Ladner's
theorem, we show that the class NPI is non-empty.
