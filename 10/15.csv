to human activity, such as road transport and other combustion sources. In this
paper we consider air pollution as a multi--level phenomenon within a Bayesian
hierarchical model. We examine different scales of variation in pollution
concentrations ranging from large scale transboundary effects to more localised
effects which are directly related to human activity. Specifically, in the
first stage of the model, we isolate underlying patterns in pollution
concentrations due to global factors such as underlying climate and topography,
which are modelled together with spatial structure. At this stage measurements
from monitoring sites located within rural areas are used which, as far as
possible, are chosen to reflect background concentrations. Having isolated
these global effects, in the second stage we assess the effects of human
activity on pollution in urban areas. The proposed model was applied to
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide measured throughout the EU for which
significant increases are found to be associated with human activity in urban
areas. The approach proposed here provides valuable information that could be
used in performing health impact assessments and to inform policy.

(SNe) are suspected to be the dominant source of dust production. However, some
observations indicate that the dust production by SNe is an inefficient
process, casting doubts on the existence of abundant SNe-dust in the early
universe. Recently, Perley et al. (2010) reported that the afterglow of GRB
071025 - an unusually red GRB at z ~ 5 - shows evidence for the SNe-produced
dust. Since this is perhaps the only high redshift GRB exhibiting compelling
evidence for SNe-dust but the result could easily be affected by small
systematics in photometry, we re-examined the extinction properties of GRB
071025 using our own optical/near-infrared data at a different epoch. In
addition, we tested SNe-dust models with different progenitor masses and dust
destruction efficiencies to constrain the dust formation mechanisms. By
searching for the best-fit model of the afterglow spectral energy distribution,
we confirm the previous claim that the dust in GRB 071025 is most likely to
originate from SNe. We also find that the SNe-dust model of 13 or 25M_{\odot}
without dust destruction fits the extinction property of GRB 071025 best, while
pair-instability SNe (PISNe) models with a 170M_{\odot} progenitor poorly fit
the data. Our results indicate that, at least in some systems at high redshift,
SNe with intermediate masses within 10 - 30M_{\odot} were the main contributors
for the dust enrichment, and the dust destruction effect due to reverse shock
was negligible.

opened and tuned. The stop-gap arises from the mutual coupling of surface
lattice resonances (SLRs), which are collective resonances associated with
counter-propagating surface polaritons. We present experimental results for
three different nanorod arrays, where we show how the dispersion of SLRs can be
controlled by modifying the size of the rods. Combining experiments with
numerical simulations, we show how the properties of the stop-gap can be
tailored by tuning a single structural factor. We find that the central
frequency of the stop-gap falls quadratically, the frequency width of the
stop-gap rises linearly, and the in-plane momentum width of the standing waves
rises quadratically, as the width of the nanorods increases. These
relationships hold for a broad range of nanorod widths, including duty cycles
of the array between 20% to 80%. We discuss the physics in terms of a coupled
oscillator analog, which relates the tunability of the stop-gaps to the
coupling strength of plasmonic modes.

investigate this 'micro-tearing' mode in greater detail to uncover its key
characteristics, and compare it with existing theoretical models of the
phenomenon. This has been accomplished using a full numerical solution of the
linear gyrokinetic-Maxwell equations. Importantly, the instability is found to
be driven by the free energy in the electron temperature gradient as described
in the literature. However, our calculations suggest it is not substantially
affected by either of the destabilising mechanisms proposed in previous
theoretical models. Instead the instability is destabilised by interactions
with magnetic drifts, and the electrostatic potential. Further calculations
reveal that the mode is not significantly destabilised by the flux surface
shaping or the large trapped particle fraction present in the spherical

higher value of plasma {\beta}, and the enhanced magnetic drifts due to the

intergalactic medium, much of which is believed to form hot coronae around
galaxies. Star-forming galaxies must be accreting from their coronae. HI
observations of external galaxies show that they have HI halos associated with
star formation. These halos are naturally modelled as ensembles of clouds
driven up by supernova bubbles. These models can fit the data successfully only
if clouds exchange mass and momentum with the corona. As a cloud orbits, it is
ablated and forms a turbulent wake where cold high-metallicity gas mixes with
hot coronal gas causing the prompt cooling of the latter. As a consequence the
total mass of HI increases. This model has recently been used to model the
Leiden-Argentina-Bonn survey of Galactic HI. The values of the model's
parameters that are required to model NGC 891, NGC 2403 and our Galaxy show a
remarkable degree of consistency, despite the very different natures of the two
external galaxies and the dramatic difference in the nature of the data for our
Galaxy and the external galaxies. The parameter values are also consistent with
hydrodynamical simulations of the ablation of individual clouds. The model
predicts that a galaxy that loses its cool-gas disc for instance through a
major merger cannot reform it from its corona; it can return to steady star
formation only if it can capture a large body of cool gas, for example by
accreting a gas-rich dwarf. Thus the model explains how major mergers can make
galaxies ""red and dead.""

interesting to explore ways to reveal remaining imperfections. In essence, the
idea of most invisibility cloaks is to recover the optical path lengths without
an object (to be made invisible) by a suitable arrangement around that object.
Optical path length is proportional to the time of flight of a light ray or to
the optical phase accumulated by a light wave. Thus, time-of-flight images
provide a direct and intuitive tool for probing imperfections. Indeed, recent
phase-sensitive experiments on the carpet cloak have already made early steps
in this direction. In the macroscopic world, time-of-flight images could be
measured directly by light detection and ranging (LIDAR). Here, we show
calculated time-of-flight images of the conformal Gaussian carpet cloak, the
conformal grating cloak, the cylindrical free-space cloak, and of the invisible
sphere. All results are obtained by using a ray-velocity equation of motion
derived from Fermat's principle.

wavelengths, and angularly small HII regions can be mistaken for PNe. This
problem of classification is most severe for HII regions in an early
evolutionary stage, those that are extremely distant, or those that are both
young and distant. Using data from the Herschel Hi-GAL survey, as well as WISE
and the Spitzer MIPSGAL and GLIMPSE surveys, we wish to establish
characteristic IR colors that can be used to distinguish between HII regions
and PNe. We perform aperture photometry measurements for a sample of 126 HII
regions and 43 PNe at wavelengths from 8.0 micron to 500 micron. We find that
HII regions and PNe have distinct IR colors. The most robust discriminating
color criteria are [F12/F8] < 0.3, [F160/F12] > 1.3, and [F160/F24] > 0.8 (or
alternately [F160/F22] > 0.8), where the brackets indicate the log of the flux
ratio. All three of these criteria are individually satisfied by over 98% of
our sample of HII regions and by about 10% of our sample of PNe. Combinations
of these colors are more robust in separating the two populations; for example
all HII regions and no PNe satisfy [F12/F8] < 0.4 and [F160/F22] > 0.8. When
applied to objects of unknown classification, these criteria prove useful in
separating the two populations. The dispersion in color is relatively small for
HII regions; this suggests that any evolution in these colors with time for HII
regions must be relatively modest. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
HII regions can be separated into ""warm"" and ""cold"" components. The ""cold""
component is well-fit by a grey-body of temperature 25K. The SEDs of nearly
two-thirds of our sample of HII regions peak at 160 micron and one third peak

problems generated by other supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of
particle physics. Given that R-parity is broken in the munuSSM, the gravitino
is a natural candidate for decaying dark matter since its lifetime becomes much
longer than the age of the Universe. In this model, gravitino dark matter could
be detectable through the emission of a monochromatic gamma ray in a two-body
decay.
  We study the prospects of the Fermi-LAT telescope to detect such
monochromatic lines in 5 years of observations of the most massive nearby
extragalactic objects.
  The dark matter halo around the Virgo galaxy cluster is selected as a
reference case, since it is associated to a particularly high signal-to-noise
ratio and is located in a region scarcely affected by the astrophysical diffuse
emission from the galactic plane.
  The simulation of both signal and background gamma-ray events is carried out
with the Fermi Science Tools, and the dark matter distribution around Virgo is
taken from a N-body simulation of the nearby extragalactic Universe, with
constrained initial conditions provided by the CLUES project.
  We find that a gravitino with a mass range of 0.6 to 2 GeV, and with a
lifetime range of about 3x10^27 to 2x10^28 s would be detectable by the
Fermi-LAT with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 3. We also obtain that
gravitino masses larger than about 4 GeV are already excluded in the munuSSM by
Fermi-LAT data of the galactic halo

such a frame. Within CES bio-inspired systems play a key role. The disclosure
from bio-inspired systems and biological computation has not been sufficiently
worked out, however. Biological computation is to be taken as the processing of
information by living systems that is carried out in polynomial time, i.e.,
efficiently; such processing however is grasped by current science and research
as an intractable problem (for instance, the protein folding problem). A remark
is needed here: P versus NP problems should be well defined and delimited but
biological computation problems are not. The shift from conventional
engineering to bio-inspired engineering needs bring the subject (or problem) of
computability to a new level. Within the frame of computation, so far, the
prevailing paradigm is still the Turing-Church thesis. In other words,
conventional engineering is still ruled by the Church-Turing thesis (CTt).
However, CES is ruled by CTt, too. Contrarily to the above, we shall argue here
that biological computation demands a more careful thinking that leads us
towards hypercomputation. Bio-inspired engineering and CES thereafter, must
turn its regard toward biological computation. Thus, biological computation can
and should be taken as the ground for engineering complex non-linear systems.
Biological systems do compute in terms of hypercomputation, indeed. If so, then
the focus is not algorithmic or computational complexity but
computation-beyond-the-Church-Turing-barrier. We claim that we need a new
computational theory that encompasses biological processes wherein the
Turing-Church thesis is but a particular case.

difficult primarily because collecting human physiologic data is intrusive,
dangerous, and expensive. Electronic health record (EHR) data promise to
support the development and testing of mechanistic physiologic models on
diverse population, but limitations in the data have thus far thwarted such
use. For instance, using uncontrolled population-scale EHR data to verify the
outcome of time dependent behavior of mechanistic, constructive models can be
difficult because: (i) aggregation of the population can obscure or generate a
signal, (ii) there is often no control population, and (iii) diversity in how
the population is measured can make the data difficult to fit into conventional
analysis techniques. This paper shows that it is possible to use EHR data to
test a physiological model for a population and over long time scales.
Specifically, a methodology is developed and demonstrated for testing a
mechanistic, time-dependent, physiological model of serum glucose dynamics with
uncontrolled, population-scale, physiological patient data extracted from an
EHR repository. It is shown that there is no observable daily variation the
normalized mean glucose for any EHR subpopulations. In contrast, a derived
value, daily variation in nonlinear correlation quantified by the time-delayed
mutual information (TDMI), did reveal the intuitively expected diurnal
variation in glucose levels amongst a wild population of humans. Moreover, in a
population of intravenously fed patients, there was no observable TDMI-based
diurnal signal. These TDMI-based signals, via a glucose insulin model, were
then connected with human feeding patterns. In particular, a constructive
physiological model was shown to correctly predict the difference between the
general uncontrolled population and a subpopulation whose feeding was
controlled.

for achieving long-lasting pavements. Such methods are based on the idea of
reducing the tensile strain at the bottom of the HMA layer below the Fatigue
Endurance Limit (FEL), a level of strain below which no cumulative damage
occurs to the HMA mixture. This study investigates the effectiveness of several
design strategies involved in long-life, perpetual pavement design. A 3D Finite
Element model of the pavement involving a linear viscoelastic constitutive
model for HMA materials and non-uniform tire contact stresses is developed
using ABAQUS 6.11. The effects of asphalt base course thickness and mixture
type, rich binder layer, and aggregate subbase layer are examined. Four asphalt
base course mixture types, namely dense graded, polymer modified, high modulus,
and standard binder, are studied as a function of the asphalt base course
thickness. The results underline a better performance of the high-modulus
asphalt base, as compared to the other base course mixtures. The aggregate
subbase layer on top of subgrade soil showed a relatively minor effect on the
longitudinal and lateral strain response at the bottom of asphalt base course.
The addition of a rich binder layer at the bottom of the asphalt base course
showed a significant reduction in tensile strains. Tables are provided as a

We demonstrate based on a Monte Carlo simulation that the observed Wr(2796) vs.
L_[OII] correlation of MgII absorbers can be well-reproduced, if all galaxies
found in deep surveys possess extended MgII halos and if the extent of MgII
halos scales proportionally with galaxy mass as shown in previous studies. The
observed correlation can be explained by a combination of (1) the known
Wr(2796) vs. rho anti-correlation in galaxy and MgII absorber pairs and (2) an
increasing aperture loss in the 3"" diameter SDSS fiber for galaxies at larger
rho. Galaxies at larger projected distances produce on average weaker MgII
absorbers and weaker (or zero) L_[OII] in SDSS QSO spectra. We show that such
correlation diminishes when larger fibers are adopted and is therefore not
physical. While under a simple halo model the majority of MgII absorbers do not
directly probe star-forming disks, they trace photo-ionized halo gas associated

relevant in the presence of electron-electron interactions, rendering the

spectral energy distribution (SED) of this galaxy. We find a total infrared
(IR) luminosity of L(8--1000 micron) = 6.9 +/- 0.6x10^11 Lsol; a factor of 3
more precise over previous L_IR estimates for this galaxy, and one of the most
accurate measurements for any galaxy at these redshifts. This FIR luminosity
implies an unlensed star formation rate (SFR) for this galaxy of 119 +/- 10
Msol per yr, which is a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.35 lower than the SFR derived from
the nebular Pa-alpha emission line (a 2.5-sigma discrepancy). Both SFR
indicators assume identical Salpeter initial mass functions (IMF) with slope
Gamma=2.35 over a mass range of 0.1 - 100 Msol, thus this discrepancy suggests
that more ionizing photons may be necessary to account for the higher
Pa-alpha-derived SFR. We examine a number of scenarios and find that the
observations can be explained with a varying star formation history (SFH) due
to an increasing star formation rate (SFR), paired with a slight flattening of
the IMF. If the SFR is constant in time, then larger changes need to be made to
the IMF by either increasing the upper-mass cutoff to ~ 200 Msol, or a
flattening of the IMF slope to 1.9 +/- 0.15, or a combination of the two. These
scenarios result in up to double the number of stars with masses above 20 Msol,
which produce the requisite increase in ionizing photons over a Salpeter IMF
with a constant SFH.

metric modified towards the IR brane, which is consistent with oblique
parameters without the need for a custodial symmetry. We have randomly
generated 40,000 sets of O(1) 5D Yukawa couplings and made a fit of the quark
masses and CKM matrix elements in both models. This method allows to identify
the percentage of points consistent with a given KK mass, which in turn
provides us with a measure for the required fine-tuning. Comparison with
current experimental data on Rb, FCNC and CP violating operators exhibits an
improved behavior of our model with respect to the RS model. In particular,
allowing 10% fine-tuning the combined results point towards upper bounds on the
KK gauge boson masses around 3.3 TeV in our model as compared with 13 TeV in
the RS model. One reason for this improvement is that fermions in our model are
shifted, with respect to fermions in the RS model, towards the UV brane thus
decreasing the strength of the modifications of electroweak observables.

signatures. The relevant interactions of the axion are a non-perturbative
oscillating contribution to the potential and a shift-symmetric coupling to
gauge fields. We review how these couplings affect the cosmological
perturbations via a unified study based on the in-in formalism. We then note
that, when the inflaton coupling to gauge fields is high enough to lead to
interesting observational results, the backreaction of the produced gauge
quanta on the inflaton dynamics becomes relevant during the final stage of
inflation, and prolongs its duration by about 10 e-foldings. We extend existing
results on gravity wave production in these models to account for this late
inflationary phase. The strong backreaction phase results in an enhancement of
the gravity wave signal at the interferometer scales. As a consequence, the
signal is potentially observable at Advanced LIGO/VIRGO for the most natural
duration of inflation in such models. Finally, we explicitly compute the axion
couplings to gauge fields in string theory construction of axion monodromy
inflation and identify cases where they can trigger interesting
phenomenological effects.

We fix all the Kaehler moduli within the Kaehler cone and the regime of
validity of the 4D effective field theory. This is achieved in a way compatible
with the local presence of chirality. The hidden sector generating the
non-perturbative effects is placed on a del Pezzo divisor that does not have
any chiral intersections with any other brane. In general, the vanishing D-term
condition implies the shrinking of the rigid divisor supporting the visible
sector. However, we avoid this problem by generating r<n D-term conditions on a
set of n intersecting divisors. The remaining (n-r) flat directions are fixed
by perturbative corrections to the Kaehler potential. We illustrate our general
claims in an explicit example. We consider a K3-fibred Calabi-Yau with four
Kaehler moduli, that is an hypersurface in a toric ambient space and admits a
simple F-theory up-lift. We present explicit choices of brane set-ups and
fluxes which lead to three different phenomenological scenarios: the first with
GUT-scale strings and TeV-scale SUSY by fine-tuning the background fluxes; the
second with an exponentially large value of the volume and TeV-scale SUSY
without fine-tuning the background fluxes; and the third with a very
anisotropic configuration that leads to TeV-scale strings and two micron-sized

Most of the proposed algorithms in BO are sequential, where only one experiment

This
impact is understood within a commonly accepted hydrodynamic picture: it is
initiated by a rapid shock and a subsequent ejection of a sheet leading to
beautiful splashing patterns. However, this picture ignores the essential role
of the air that is trapped between the impacting drop and the surface. Here we
describe a new imaging modality that is sensitive to the behavior right at the
surface. We show that a very thin film of air, only a few tens of nanometers
thick, remains trapped between the falling drop and the surface as the drop
spreads. The thin film of air serves to lubricate the drop enabling the fluid
to skate on the air film laterally outward at surprisingly high velocities,
consistent with theoretical predictions. Eventually this thin film of air must
break down as the fluid wets the surface. We suggest that this occurs in a
spinodal-like fashion, and causes a very rapid spreading of a wetting front
outwards; simultaneously the wetting fluid spreads inward much more slowly,
trapping a bubble of air within the drop. Our results show that the dynamics of
impacting drops are much more complex than previously thought and exhibit a
rich array of unexpected phenomena that require rethinking classical paradigms.

particle multiplicity, which tracks initial state entropy production, increases
by a factor of two relative to the top RHIC energy, with a centrality
dependence close to that already measured at RHIC. Measurements of elliptic
flow out to large transverse momentum also show similar results to what was
measured at RHIC, but no significant pseudorapidity dependence. Comparisons are
made with elliptic flow predicted using energy loss calculations. Extensions of
these measurements to higher harmonics have also been made, and can be used to
explain novel structures in the two-particle correlation functions that had
long been attributed to jet-medium interactions. New hard probe measurements
include single muons, jets and high p_T hadrons. Single muons at high momentum
can be used to extract the yield of W\pm bosons and are found to be consistent
within statistical uncertainties with a scaling with binary collisions.
Conversely, jets are found to be suppressed in central events by a factor of
approximately two relative to peripheral events, with no significant dependence
on the jet energy. Fragmentation functions are also found to be the same in
central and peripheral events. Update asymmetry results confirm previous ATLAS
measurements with increased statistics, and multiple jet cone sizes are

Both have two characteristic length scales. In atomic physics the lengths are
the Compton wavelength of the electron and the Bohr radius; the ratio of these
two lengths is the fine structure constant, $\alpha=7.30\times10^{-3}$. In
cosmology we take the lengths to be the Planck length and the de Sitter radius
divided by $\sqrt 3$; the ratio of these two lengths is about
$\alpha_g=1.91\times10^{-61}$, which we suggest should be called the
gravitational fine structure constant. There is also a basic energy ratio in
atomic physics, the ratio of the hydrogen atom binding energy to the electron
rest energy, which is equal to ${\alpha^2}/2$. The analogous energy ratio in
cosmology is the ratio of the dark energy density (described in terms of the
cosmological constant) to the Planck energy density, which is equal to
$(1/8\pi)\alpha_g^2$. The long-standing problem of the nature of the dark
energy and its small density is obviously equivalent to understanding the
extraordinarily small value of $\alpha_g$. We further emphasize that our
observational knowledge of dark energy, which is consistent with the
cosmological constant interpretation, is entirely on the cosmological scale, so
we know essentially nothing about the nature of dark energy on a smaller and

variable with mean $n$. For $\lambda>0$, consider the length of the longest
path whose average weight is at most $\lambda$. It was shown by Aldous (1998)
that the length is of order $\log n$ for $\lambda < 1/\mathrm{e}$ and of order
$n$ for $\lambda > 1/\mathrm{e}$. Aldous (2003) posed the question on detailed
behavior at and near criticality $1/\mathrm{e}$. In particular, Aldous asked
whether there exist scaling exponents $\mu, \nu$ such that for $\lambda$ within
$1/\mathrm{e}$ of order $n^{-\mu}$, the length for the longest path of average
weight at most $\lambda$ has order $n^\nu$.
  We answer this question by showing that the critical behavior is far richer:
For $\lambda$ around $1/\mathrm{e}$ within a window of $\alpha(\log n)^{-2}$
with a small absolute constant $\alpha>0$, the longest path is of order $(\log
n)^3$. Furthermore, for $\lambda \geq 1/\mathrm{e} + \beta (\log n)^{-2}$ with
$\beta$ a large absolute constant, the longest path is at least of length a
polynomial in $n$. An interesting consequence of our result is the existence of
a second transition point in $1/\mathrm{e} + [\alpha (\log n)^{-2}, \beta (\log

critical regime. Our results were not known before even in a heuristic sense.

i.i.d Gaussian wiretap channel with an i.i.d Gaussian side information
available at the intended receiver is considered. The intended receiver is
assumed to have a certain minimum SNR and the eavesdropper is assumed to have a
strictly lower SNR, compared to the intended receiver. The objective is to
minimize the distortion of source reconstruction at the intended receiver. In
this work, it is shown that the source-channel separation coding scheme is
optimum in the sense of achieving minimum distortion. Two hybrid digital-analog
Wyner-Ziv coding schemes are then proposed which achieve the minimum
distortion. These secure joint source-channel coding schemes are based on the
Wyner-Ziv coding scheme and wiretap channel coding scheme when the analog
source is not explicitly quantized. The proposed secure hybrid digital-analog
schemes are analyzed under the main channel SNR mismatch. It is proven that the
proposed schemes can give a graceful degradation of distortion with SNR under
SNR mismatch, i.e., when the actual SNR is larger than the designed SNR.

that traveltimes of reflected rays do not contain enough information to recover

on top of the well-known rearrangement ambiguity due to low velocity zones.

MV/m. This ring can store protons of 0.7 GeV/c momentum, also known as ""magic""
due to the unique property that the spin and momentum vectors precess at the
same rate in any electric field. If the spin is kept longitudinal for most of
the duration of the storage time, the radial E-field acts on the proton
electric dipole moment and can cause a measureable vertical spin precession.
Studies on spin coherence time, on the polarimeter system, and the electric

  (I) retrieve any segment of K<=N consecutive symbols from the Burrows-Wheeler
transform of T, and
  (II) retrieve any chunk of K<=N consecutive entries of the Suffix Array or
the Suffix Tree.
  Prior literature would take O(N log N) comparisons (and time) to solve these
problems by solving the total problem of building the entire Burrows-Wheeler
transform or Text Index for T, and performing a post-processing to single out
the wanted portion.
  We introduce a novel adaptive approach to partial computational problems
above, and solve both the partial problems in O(K log K + N) comparisons and
time, improving the best known running times of O(N log N) for K=o(N).
  These partial-computation problems are intimately related since they share a
common bottleneck: the suffix multi-selection problem, which is to output the
suffixes of rank r_1,r_2,...,r_K under the lexicographic order, where
r_1<r_2<...<r_K, r_i in [1,N]. Special cases of this problem are well known:
K=N is the suffix sorting problem that is the workhorse in Stringology with
hundreds of applications, and K=1 is the recently studied suffix selection.
  We show that suffix multi-selection can be solved in Theta(N log N -
sum_{j=0}^K Delta_j log Delta_j+N) time and comparisons, where r_0=0,
r_{K+1}=N+1, and Delta_j=r_{j+1}-r_j for 0<=j<=K. This is asymptotically
optimal, and also matches the bound in [Dobkin, Munro, JACM 28(3)] for
multi-selection on atomic elements (not suffixes). Matching the bound known for
atomic elements for strings is a long running theme and challenge from 70's,
which we achieve for the suffix multi-selection problem. The partial suffix
problems as well as the suffix multi-selection problem have many applications.

sampling methods. The main challenge then is to determine an efficient sampling

Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, Slice Sampling and the Hybrid Monte Carlo
(HMC) technique, are tested by updating a structural beam model. The efficiency
and limitations of each technique is investigated when the FEM updating problem
is implemented using the Bayesian Approach. Both MH and HMC techniques are

such networks are ubiquitous in real-life world. In this paper, we study the
trapping problem on two families of networks. The first is deterministic, often
called $(x,y)$-flowers; the other is random, which is a combination of
$(1,3)$-flower and $(2,4)$-flower and thus called hybrid networks. The two
network families display rich behavior as observed in various real systems, as
well as some unique topological properties not shared by other networks. We
derive analytically the average trapping time for random walks on both the
$(x,y)$-flowers and the hybrid networks with an immobile trap positioned at an
initial node, i.e., a hub node with the highest degree in the networks. Based
on these analytical formulae, we show how the average trapping time scales with
the network size. Comparing the obtained results, we further uncover that
fractal dimension plays a decisive role in the behavior of average trapping
time on fractal scale-free networks, i.e., the average trapping time decreases
with an increasing fractal dimension.

challenging computational problems in reliability engineering. The failure
probability is usually given by an integral over a high-dimensional uncertain
parameter space that is difficult to evaluate numerically. This paper focuses
on enhancements to Subset Simulation (SS), proposed by Au and Beck, which
provides an efficient algorithm based on MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo)
simulation for computing small failure probabilities for general
high-dimensional reliability problems. First, we analyze the Modified
Metropolis algorithm (MMA), an MCMC technique, which is used in SS for sampling
from high-dimensional conditional distributions. We present some observations
on the optimal scaling of MMA, and develop an optimal scaling strategy for this
algorithm when it is employed within SS. Next, we provide a theoretical basis
for the optimal value of the conditional failure probability $p_0$, an
important parameter one has to choose when using SS. Finally, a Bayesian
post-processor SS+ for the original SS method is developed where the uncertain
failure probability that one is estimating is modeled as a stochastic variable
whose possible values belong to the unit interval. Simulated samples from SS
are viewed as informative data relevant to the system's reliability. Instead of
a single real number as an estimate, SS+ produces the posterior PDF of the
failure probability, which takes into account both prior information and the
information in the sampled data. This PDF quantifies the uncertainty in the
value of the failure probability and it may be further used in risk analyses to
incorporate this uncertainty. The relationship between the original SS and SS+
is also discussed

  An LQR based cost functional is also presented and the solution is found

high until the patient shows signs of recovery after which, the therapy
gradually decreases. This is in line with the biomedical philosophy. Solution
to a modified problem which includes a weight for total time is approximated

the activation energy, with the assumption that, high-energy collisions between

show that a stronger attractive van der Waals (vdW) and electron-ion Coulomb
interactions between two polarized atoms are responsible to initiate a chemical
reaction, either before or after the collision. We derive this stronger vdW
attraction formula exactly using the quasi one-dimensional Drude model within
the ionization energy theory and the energy-level spacing renormalization group
method. Along the way, we (ii) expose the precise physical mechanism
responsible for the existence of a stronger vdW interaction for both long and
short distances, and also show how to technically avoid the electron-electron
Coulomb repulsion between polarized electrons from these two reactant atoms.
Finally, we properly and correctly associate the existence of this stronger
attraction to Ramachandran's 'normal limits' (distance shorter than what is
allowed by the standard vdW bond) between chemically nonbonded atoms.

complex formation and evolution environment. A detailed compositional analysis
of 16 asteroids suggests several distinct surface assemblages including
ordinary chondrites (Gaffey SIV subtype), primitive achondrites (Gaffey SIII
subtype), basaltic achondrites (Gaffey SVII subtype and V-type), and a
carbonaceous chondrite. Based on our mineralogical analysis we conclude that
(298) Baptistina is similar to ordinary chondrites (LL-type) based on olivine
and pyroxene mineralogy and moderate albedo. S-type and V-type in and around
the vicinity of BAF we characterized show mineralogical affinity to (8) Flora

lower SNR spectra showing only a 'single' band are compositionally similar to

symmetry alone can not robustly protect the weak TI state in the presence of

bulk, a topologically non-trivial weak TI state can be obtained with helical
edge states on the CDW domain walls. In other words, a CDW domain wall on the
surface is topologically equivalent to the edge of a two-dimensional quantum
spin Hall insulator. Therefore, the surface state of a weak topological
insulator with translation symmetry breaking on the surface has a ""half quantum
spin Hall effect"", in the same way that the surface state of a strong

that the Waboba bounces better than the others, but why? The Superball has a
high coefficient of restitution, creating large rebounds. Here the impact is
angled to the free surface, but the inelastic response and large mass ratio
forces the ball underwater without skipping. The racquetball has a lower mass
ratio and a more elastic response to impacts. Also thrown at a shallow angle,
it bounces off of the surface of the water 1-3 times before coming to rest. The
Waboba flattens inside the cavity allowing it to skip off of the surface more
easily. The flattened ball looks more like a skipping stone than a sphere due
to its large elastic deformation at impact. Examining the reaction of a
skipping stone we see that the stone creates a cavity in which it planes,
slipping out of it with some upward velocity. The Waboba behaves like a
skipping stone planing on the surface of the water, allowing it to bounce
upwards of 20 times and traveling nearly 60 meters. While some skill is needed
to throw the Waboba across a pond, It adapts to each skip because of its
elastic response, whereas the stone must be thrown perfectly in order to gain
the best skipping advantage.

vibrate, producing sound. A pulsatile jet of air is formed downstream of the
vibrating folds which interacts with the various structures in the airway.
Currently, it is postulated that the way this jet interacts with the downstream
structures in the airway directly affects the quality of human speech. In order
to better understand this jet, it is desirable to visualize the jet in three
dimensions. We present the results of a method that reconstructs the three
dimensional velocity field using Synthetic aperture PIV (SAPIV)
\cite{Belden:2010}.
  SAPIV uses an array of high-speed cameras to artificially create a single
camera with a variable focal length. This is accomplished by overlapping the
images from the array to create a ""focal stack"". As the images are increasingly
overlapped, more distant image planes come into focus. 3D PIV is then performed
on the ""refocused"" focal stack to reconstruct the flow field in three
dimensions. SAPIV has the ability to track very high particle densities.
  Artificial self oscillating vocal folds made of silicone were driven with
compressed air infused with small glass microspheres. As the vocal folds
vibrated, the entrained microspheres were illuminated by a laser volume. Eight
high-speed cameras were used to capture images of the particles for SAPIV
postprocessing.
  SAPIV was able to successfully perform the first whole-field reconstruction
of the pulsatile jet emerging from the vocal folds. The ability to visualize
this jet will help researchers and clinicians better understand the physics of
speech production as well as improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
of voice disorders.
