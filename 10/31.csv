syndrome is often determined combining maternal age, serum free beta-HCG,
PAPP-A levels and embryonic measurements of crown-rump length and nuchal
translucency for gestational ages between 11 and 13 weeks. It appeared
important to get a precise knowledge of these scan parameters' normal values
during the first trimester. This paper focused on crown-rump length. ---
METHODS --- 402 pregnancies from in-vitro fertilization allowing a precise
estimation of foetal ages (FA) were used to determine the best model that
describes crown-rump length (CRL) as a function of FA. Scan measures by a
single operator from 3846 spontaneous pregnancies representative of the general
population from Northern France were used to build a mathematical model linking
FA and CRL in a context as close as possible to normal scan screening used in
Down's syndrome likelihood determination. We modeled both CRL as a function of
FA and FA as a function of CRL. For this, we used a clear methodology and
performed regressions with heteroskedastic corrections and robust regressions.
The results were compared by cross-validation to retain the equations with the
best predictive power. We also studied the errors between observed and
predicted values. --- Results --- Data from 513 spontaneous pregnancies allowed
to model CRL as a function of age of foetal age. The best model was a
polynomial of degree 2. Datation with our equation that models spontaneous
pregnancies from a general population was in quite agreement with objective
datations obtained from 402 IVF pregnancies and thus support the validity of
our model. The most precise measure of CRL was when the SD was minimal
(1.83mm), for a CRL of 23.6 mm where our model predicted a 49.4 days of foetal
age. Our study allowed to model the SD from 30 to 90 days of foetal age and
offers the opportunity of using Zscores in the future to detect growth
abnormalities. --- Conclusion --- With powerful statistical tools we report a
good modeling of the first trimester embryonic growth in the general population
allowing a better knowledge of the date of fertilization useful in the
ultrasound screening of Down's syndrome. The optimal period to measure CRL and
predict foetal age was 49.4 days (9 weeks of gestational age). Our results open
the way to the detection of foetal growth abnormalities using CRL Zscores
throughout the first trimester.

two-spinon contribution to the spectral decomposition of the longitudinal
structure factor $S^{zz}(k,w)$. We find that this contribution provides an
accurate approximation to the full structure factor over a wide range of the
anisotropy parameter. The asymptotic behaviour of $S^{zz}(k,w)$ is computed as
the upper and lower $w$ thresholds of the two-spinon $(w,k)$ band are
approached, and an analysis of the region of validity of this threshold
behaviour is performed. Our results reproduce and refine existing threshold
behaviour predictions and extend these results to an accurate description

designed to take advantage of the partitionable workloads of on-line

optimized to execute to completion on a single node in a shared-nothing cluster
without needing to coordinate with other nodes or use expensive concurrency
control measures. But some OLTP applications cannot be partitioned such that
all of their transactions execute within a single-partition in this manner.
These distributed transactions access data not stored within their local
partitions and subsequently require more heavy-weight concurrency control
protocols. Further difficulties arise when the transaction's execution
properties, such as the number of partitions it may need to access or whether
it will abort, are not known beforehand. The DBMS could mitigate these
performance issues if it is provided with additional information about

automatically selecting which optimizations a DBMS could use, namely (1) more
efficient concurrency control schemes, (2) intelligent scheduling, (3) reduced
undo logging, and (4) speculative execution. To evaluate our techniques, we
implemented our models and integrated them into a parallel, main-memory OLTP

mutual information is equal to the causal MMSE in the AWGN channel, which can
equivalently be expressed saying that the difference between the input-output

variable (regardless of the distribution of the channel input). We characterize
this random variable explicitly, rather than merely its expectation. Classical
estimation and information theoretic quantities emerge with new and surprising

by the causal MMSE (which, in turn, is equal to the mutual information by
Duncan's result).

mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 arises from the presence of a third body with a
large inclination to the binary orbit. We show that this long period motion
arises if the system is librating around the stable fixed point in a Kozai
resonance. We demonstrate that mass transfer drives the system toward this
fixed point, and calculate, both analytically and via numerical integrations,
that the period of libration is of order 170 days when the mutual inclination
is near the Kozai critical value. The non-zero eccentricity of the binary,
combined with tidal dissipation, implies that the rate of change of the binary
period would be slower than, or even of opposite sign to, that implied by
standard mass transfer models. If the 170 day period results from libration,
then, contrary to appearances, the orbital period of the inner binary is
increasing with time; in that case, (e/0.009)^2Q/k_2 > 2.5 x 10^9, where k_2 =
0.01 is the tidal Love number and e = 0.009 is the fiducial eccentricity of the

field of the host globular cluster NGC 6624. The discrepancy between the

implementation of this method.
  Orbifolds are a subject of central importance in string theory. It is widely
known that there may be two or more orbifolds of a space by a finite group.
Abelian Calabi-Yau orbifolds of the form $\BC^3 / \Gamma$ can be counted
according to the size of the group $|\Gamma|$. Three methods of counting these
orbifolds will be given.
  A brane tiling together with a set of Chern Simons levels is sufficient to
define a quiver Chern-Simons theory which describes the worldvolume theory of
the M2-brane probe. A forward algorithm exists which allows us to easily
compute the toric data associated to the moduli space of the quiver
Chern-Simons theory from knowledge of the tiling and Chern-Simons levels. This
forward algorithm will be discussed and illustrated with a few examples. It is
possible that two different Chern-Simons theories have the same moduli-space.
This effect, sometimes known as `toric duality' will be described further. We
will explore how two Chern--Simons theories (corresponding to brane tilings)
can be related to each other by the Higgs mechanism and how brane tilings (with
CS levels) that correspond to 14 fano 3-folds have been constructed.

supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics. We

baryon number minus lepton number, extension of the MSSM, where annihilation
can be purely to heavy right-handed neutrinos. We compare the galactic and

spin-orbit interactions, allowing for the creation of spin-polarized
wavepackets in zero magnetic field. Second, we find that the interplay of
Coulomb and spin-orbit interactions is significantly more important for holes
than for electrons and can be probed through the quasiparticle group
velocities. These effects should be directly observable in magnetotransport,
Raman scattering, and femtosecond-resolved Faraday rotation measurements. Our
results are in agreement with a general argument on the velocities, which we
formulate for an arbitrary choice of the spin-orbit coupling.

different energies $E$ into distinct directions and space locations, and to
take a snapshot of the whole spectrum of photon energies with a spatially
sensitive photon detector. Substantial advantage of a spectrograph over an
ordinary spectral analyzer, is its ability to deal with many photon energies
simultaneously, thus reducing exposure time per spectrum considerably. To
realize a spectrograph, dispersing elements with large angular dispersion rate
are required. Here we show, on the example of CDW x-ray optics [1-3], that
multi-crystal arrangements may feature cumulative angular dispersion rates more
than an order of magnitude larger than those attainable in single Bragg
reflections. This makes, first, hard x-ray spectrographs feasible, and,
secondly, a resolving power beyond $E/\Delta E \gtrsim 10^{8}$ achievable.

subsystem triggers rare transitions between slow regimes, akin to weather or
climate regimes. Using homogenization techniques, a reduced stochastic
parametrization model is derived for the slow dynamics. The reliability of this
reduced climate model in reproducing the statistics of the slow dynamics of the
full deterministic model for finite values of the time scale separation is
numerically established. The statistics however is sensitive to uncertainties
in the parameters of the stochastic model. It is investigated whether the
stochastic climate model can be beneficial as a forecast model in an ensemble
data assimilation setting, in particular in the realistic setting when
observations are only available for the slow variables. The main result is that
reduced stochastic models can indeed improve the analysis skill, when used as
forecast models instead of the perfect full deterministic model. The stochastic
climate model is far superior at detecting transitions between regimes. The
observation intervals for which skill improvement can be obtained are related
to the characteristic time scales involved. The reason why stochastic climate
models are capable of producing superior skill in an ensemble setting is due to
the finite ensemble size; ensembles obtained from the perfect deterministic
forecast model lacks sufficient spread even for moderate ensemble sizes.
Stochastic climate models provide a natural way to provide sufficient ensemble
spread to detect transitions between regimes. This is corroborated with
numerical simulations. The conclusion is that stochastic parametrizations are
attractive for data assimilation despite their sensitivity to uncertainties in
the parameters.

casuality still holds. A new dispersion relation is obtained in a class of
Finsler spacetime. It is shown that the superluminal speed is linearly
dependent on the energy per unit mass of the particle. We find that such a

indeed none is found. If the 2D modes are not directly forced, k^{-2} and
k^{-1} spectra are found for the Alfven waves and the 2D modes, respectively,

scales as the ratio of the energy fluxes in the counterpropagting Alfven waves.

implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive systems of
interest in logic and computer science. LFMTP 2011 was held on August 26, 2011
in Nijmegen, Netherlands, as a workshop associated with ITP 2011, the Second
International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving. Its program consisted
of contributed and invited presentations and was integrated with that of MLPA
11, the Third Workshop on Modules and Libraries for Proof Assistants. This
proceedings contains only the contributed papers that were accepted for
presentation at the workshop. Each of these papers was accepted based on the
reviews of three members of the program committee. Authors were subsequently
given the opportunity to revise their submissions based on the comments
provided by the reviewers and the feedback obtained during their presentations
at the workshop.

have revealed further details of the structure of the emission region. We
investigate the emission region for the multi-wavelength light curve using
outer gap model. We assume that gamma-ray and non-thermal X-ray photons are
emitted from a particle acceleration region in the outer magnetosphere, and
UV/optical photons originate above that region. We also assume that gamma-rays
are radiated only by outwardly moving particles, whereas the other photons are
produced by particles moving inward and outward. We parametrize the altitude of
the emission region. We find that the outer gap model can explain the
multi-wavelength pulse behavior. From observational fitting, we also find a
general tendency for the altitude of the gamma-ray emission region to depend on
the inclination angle. In particular, the emission region for low inclination
angle is required to be located in very low altitude, which corresponds to the
inner region within the last-open field line of rotating dipole in vacuum. This
model suggests a modification of statistics about observed gamma-ray pulsars.

observable for self-avoiding walks interacting with a surface on the honeycomb

square and triangular lattices, we show that in the limit of large lattices,
some of the consequences observed for the honeycomb lattice persist
irrespective of lattice. This permits the accurate estimation of the critical

the state-of-the-art channel codes namely LDPC codes, turbo codes, and their
variants and assume classical unique decoding. In this paper, we present an
algebraic approach to SCSI based on the list decoding of the underlying channel
codes. We show that the theoretical limit of SCSI can be achieved in the
proposed list decoding based framework when the correlation between the source
and side information is $q$-ary symmetric. We argue that, as opposed to channel
coding, the correct sequence from the list produced by the list decoder can
effectively be recovered in case of SCSI with a few CRC symbols. The CRC
symbols, which allow the decoder to identify the correct sequence, incur
negligible overhead for large block lengths. More importantly, these CRC
symbols are not subject to noise since we are dealing with a virtual noisy
channel rather than a real noisy channel. Finally, we present a guideline for
designing constructive SCSI schemes for non-binary and binary sources using
Reed Solomon codes and BCH codes, respectively. This guideline allows us to
design a SCSI scheme for any arbitrary $q$-ary symmetric correlation without
resorting to simulation.

systematic variation of the shape of the 1.24 s pulse profile. While there is
general consensus that the flux modulation is due to variable shading of the
X-ray emitting regions on the surface of the neutron star by the precessing
accretion disk, the physical reason for the variation of the pulse profiles had
remained controversial. Following the suggestion by Truemper et al. (1986) that
free precession of the neutron star may be responsible for the variation of the
pulse profiles, we had developed physical models of strong feedback interaction
between the neutron star and the accretion disk in order to explain the
seemingly identical values for the periods of the two types of variations. In a
deep analysis of pulse profiles observed by several different satellites over
the last three decades we find now that the clock behind the pulse profile
variations shows exactly the same erratic behavior as the turn-on clock, even
on short time scales (100 d), suggesting that there may in fact be only one 35
d clock in the system. If this is true, it presents a serious challenge for the
idea of free precession of the neutron star and calls for alternative physical
models for the variation in pulse shape.

inspirations for understanding 1d interacting fermions. At $\beta=1,
\text{or}0$, the CS model describes a free non-relativistic fermion, or boson
theory, while for generic $\beta$, the system can be interpreted either as
interacting fermions or bosons, or free anyons depending on the context.
However, we shall show in this letter that the fermionic picture is
advantageous in diagonalizing the CS Hamiltonian. Comparing to the previously
known multi-integral representation or the Dunkl operator formalism for the CS
wave functions, our method depends on the (upper or lower) triangular nature of
the fermion interaction, which is resolved in perturbation theory of the second
quantized form. The eigenstate is constructed from a multiplet of unperturbed
states and the perturbation is of finite order. The full construction is a
similarity transformation from the free fermion theory, in the same spirit as
the Landau Fermi liquid theory and the 1d Luttinger liquid theory. That means
quasi-particles or anyons can be represented in terms of free fermion modes (or
bosonic modes via bosonization). The method is applicable to other (higher than
one space dimension) systems for which the adiabatic theorem applies.

  through Modulation of Carrier Wave","7 pages, 3figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An intuitive physical mechanism for single attosecond pulse generation in
multi-cycle pulse regime is proposed. We suggest that the continuum spectra of
HHG can be controlled through the modulation of carrier wave, while keeping the
multi-cycle envelope unchanged approximately. By increasing the time interval
between the adjacent maximum return kinetic energy peaks, the kinetic energy of
the side peaks will be apparently suppressed by the multi-cycle envelope. The
photons with energies near the cutoff burst only at the pulse center with high
coherence, which contribute to the generation of single attosecond pulse. We
verify this mechanism by using a multi-cycle tri-color pulse as driver field.

investigate the problem of reconstructing a near perfect phylogeny over a

gained and lost at most once. Based on this notion, we define the problem of
the Persistent Perfect Phylogeny (referred as P-PP). We restate the P-PP
problem as a special case of the Incomplete Directed Perfect Phylogeny, called
Incomplete Perfect Phylogeny with Persistent Completion, (refereed as IP-PP),
where the instance is an incomplete binary matrix M having some missing
entries, denoted by symbol ?, that must be determined (or completed) as 0 or 1
so that M admits a binary perfect phylogeny. We show that the IP-PP problem can
be reduced to a problem over an edge colored graph since the completion of each
column of the input matrix can be represented by a graph operation. Based on
this graph formulation, we develop an exact algorithm for solving the P-PP
problem that is exponential in the number of characters and polynomial in the
number of species.

is possible to construct two different types of Lax pairs depending on the

interesting to note that the $\eta$ pair or the $d$ -wave pair condensate in
$T_{c}$ superconductivity can be the ground state of a Hamiltonian in the
family. These models are two-dimensional because only the z-component of the
total electron spin $S_z$ is conserved. Significantly, for the $\eta$ pair or

operator. Because of its dependence on the pion decay constant F through the
chemical potential in the epsilon-regime of chiral perturbation theory this can
be used for lattice determinations of that low-energy constant. On the
technical side we use a chiral Random-Two Matrix Theory, where we express the
k-th eigenvalue distribution through the joint probability of the ordered k
smallest eigenvalues. The latter can be computed exactly for finite and
infinite N, for which we derive generalisations of Dyson's integration Theorem
and Sonine's identity.

Moreover, a transition to a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with k3 =

by neutron powder diffraction using group theory analysis as a preliminary
tool. Different coordinations of the Co2+ ions involved in the low-symmetry

evidence of competing magnetic interactions. The temperature dependent changes

sharing the knowledge of the user's data symbols to be transmitted towards K
single-antenna receivers (RXs). We consider a distributed channel state
information (DCSI) configuration where each TX has its own local estimate of
the overall multiuser MIMO channel. The focus of this work is on the
optimization of the allocation of the CSI feedback subject to a constraint on
the total sharing through the backhaul network. Building upon the Wyner model,
we derive a new approach to allocate the CSI feedback while making efficient
use of the pathloss structure to reduce the amount of feedback necessary. We
show that the proposed CSI allocation achieves good performance with only a
number of CSI bits per TX which does not scale with the number of cooperating
TXs, thus making the joint transmission from a large number of TXs more
practical than previously thought. Indeed, the proposed CSI allocation reduces
the cooperation to a local scale, which allows also for a reduced allocation of
the user's data symbols. We further show that the approach can be extended to a
more general class of channel: the exponentially decaying channels, which model
accuratly the cooperation of TXs located on a one dimensional space. Finally,
we verify by simulations that the proposed CSI allocation leads to very little
performance losses.

(ii) a unique signature of this charge pumping phenomenon, which disappears if

that changes sign as the function of the precession cone angle; (iii) unlike
standard spin pumping in the absence of SOCs, where one emitted or absorbed
microwave photon is sufficient to match the exact solution in the frame
rotating with the magnetization, the presence of the Rashba SOC requires to
take into account up to ten photons in order to reach the asymptotic value of

the limiting probability density of the position of the walker multiplied by a
scaling function of time. We show that the probability density of the scaled
walker position converges in the long-time limit to a non-degenerate one only
if the scaling function behaves in a certain way. This function as well as the

the limiting probability density which has heavy tails in terms of the Fox

We shall first review a series of pioneering experiments in generating
synthetic gauge potentials and spin-orbit coupling in atomic gases by
engineering atom-light interaction. Realization of spin-orbit coupled quantum
gases opens a new avenue in cold atom physics, and also brings out a lot of new
physical problems. In particular, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and
inter-atomic interaction leads to many intriguing phenomena. Here, by reviewing
recent theoretical studies of both interacting bosons and fermions with
isotropic Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the key message delivered here is that
spin-orbit coupling can enhance the interaction effects, and make the
interaction effects much more dramatic even in the weakly interacting regime.

semi-empirical library of galaxy spectra, (2) a comparison between the observed

library. Methods: We use chi2-fitting to fit SDSS galaxy spectra with the
synthetic library in order to construct a semi-empirical library of galaxy
spectra in which (1) the real spectra are extended by the synthetic ones in
order to cover the full wavelength range of Gaia, and (2) astrophysical
parameters are assigned to the SDSS spectra by the best fitting synthetic
spectrum. The SVM models were trained with and applied to semi-empirical
spectra. Tests were performed for the classification of spectral types and the
estimation of the most significant galaxy parameters (in particular redshift,
mass to light ratio and star formation history). Results: We produce a
semi-empirical library of 33670 galaxy spectra covering the wavelength range
250 to 1050 nm at a sampling of 1 nm or less. Using the results of the fitting
of the SDSS spectra with our synthetic library, we investigate the range of the

the assumed neutrino production period. Radio-loud active galactic nuclei with
their jets pointing almost directly towards the observer, the so- called
blazars, are particularly attractive potential neutrino point sources, since
they are among the most likely sources of the observed ultra high energy cosmic
rays and therefore, neutrinos and gamma-rays may be produced in hadronic
interactions with the surrounding medium. The gamma-ray light curves of blazars
measured by the LAT instrument on-board the Fermi satellite reveal important
time variability information. A strong correlation between the gamma-ray and
the neutrino fluxes is expected in this scenario. An unbinned method based on
the minimization of a likelihood ratio was applied to a subsample data
collected in 2008 (61 days live time). By looking for neutrinos detected in the
high state periods of the AGN light curve, the sensitivity to these sources has
been improved by about a factor 2 with respect to a standard time-integrated

structures such as Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) often shape
the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). They may introduce interplanetary
paths that are longer than nominal, and magnetic connections rooted far from
the nominal Parker spiral. We present a detailed study of the IMF
configurations during ten relativistic solar particle events of the 23rd
activity cycle to elucidate the actual IMF configuration guiding the particles
to Earth, where they are measured by neutron monitors. We use magnetic field
(MAG) and plasma parameter measurements (SWEPAM) from ACE, and determine
interplanetary path lengths of energetic particles through a modified version
of the velocity dispersion analysis based on energetic particle measurements
with SoHO/ERNE. We find that the majority (7/10) of the events is detected in
the vicinity of an ICME. Their interplanetary path lengths are found to be
longer (1.5-2.6 AU) than those of the two events propagating in the slow solar
wind (1.3 AU). The largest apparent path length is found in an event within the
fast solar wind, probably due to enhanced pitch angle scattering. The derived
path lengths imply that the first energetic and relativistic protons are
released at the Sun at the same time as electron beams emitting type III radio
bursts. The timing of the first high-energy particle arrival at Earth is
dominantly determined by the type of IMF in which the particles propagate.
Initial arrival times are as expected from Parker's model in the slow solar
wind, and significantly larger in or near transient structures such as ICMEs.

investigate how they may formally generalized, going beyond the description in
terms of selfadjoint operators and projective measurements, and how this leads
to the introduction of generalized measurements, probability operator-valued
measures (POVM) and detection operators. We then state and prove the Naimark

covariates. In this paper we propose EEScreen, a screening procedure that can
be used with any model that can be fit using estimating equations, and provide
unified results on its finite-sample screening performance. EEScreen thus
generalizes many recently proposed model-based and model-free screening
procedures. We also propose iEEScreen, an iterative version of EEScreen, and
show that it is closely related to a recently studied boosting method for
estimating equations. We show via simulations for two different estimating
equations that EEScreen and iEEScreen are useful and flexible screening
procedures, and demonstrate our methods on data from a multiple myeloma study.

to a node. Polymatroidal networks were introduced by Lawler and Martel and
Hassin in the single-commodity setting and are closely related to the
submodular flow model of Edmonds and Giles; the well-known maxflow-mincut
theorem holds in this more general setting. Polymatroidal networks for the
multicommodity case have not, as far as the authors are aware, been previously
explored. Our work is primarily motivated by applications to information flow
in wireless networks. We also consider the notion of undirected polymatroidal
networks and observe that they provide a natural way to generalize flows and
cuts in edge and node capacitated undirected networks.
  We establish poly-logarithmic flow-cut gap results in several scenarios that
have been previously considered in the standard network flow models where
capacities are on the edges or nodes. Our results have already found
aplications in wireless network information flow and we anticipate more in the
future. On the technical side our key tools are the formulation and analysis of
the dual of the flow relaxations via continuous extensions of submodular
functions, in particular the Lov\'asz extension. For directed graphs we rely on
a simple yet useful reduction from polymatroidal networks to standard networks.
For undirected graphs we rely on the interplay between the Lov\'asz extension
of a submodular function and line embeddings with low average distortion
introduced by Matousek and Rabinovich; this connection is inspired by, and
generalizes, the work of Feige, Hajiaghayi and Lee on node-capacitated
multicommodity flows and cuts. The applicability of embeddings to polymatroidal

electrodynamics, and Schwinger's calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment
of the electron in QED. From the perspective of strong interactions, however,
electromagnetic effects usually amount to negligible contributions. Despite
this fact, electromagnetic probes have always been a fundamental source for our
knowledge of QCD experimentally. Elastic scattering of electrons off nucleons
provides us a window to their distributions of charge and magnetism. To account
for the spectrum of QCD at the percent level, moreover, we need isospin
breaking introduced from both quark masses and electric charges. This overview
concerns some of the prospects and progress of studying electromagnetic effects
in QCD. Our focus is divided between classical and quantum effects. In
classical electromagnetic fields, the dynamical response of QCD to external
conditions can be investigated. The vacuum and hadrons alike should be viewed
as media which respond to external fields: both magnetize and polarize in
magnetic fields, for example. At the quantum level, electromagnetism and QCD
renormalize each other. In the era of high precision lattice computations, both
strong and electromagnetic contributions must be accounted for to make
predictions at the percent level.

massive stars and their explosions as SNs shape the ISM and trigger star
formation. Studying evolved stars is fundamental for understanding galaxy
formation and evolution, at any redshift. We aim to establish a photometric
classification scheme for Galactic mass-losing evolved stars (e.g., WR, RSG,
and AGB stars) with the goal of identifying new ones, and subsequently to use
the sample as tracers of Galactic structure. We searched for counterparts of
known Galactic WR, LBV, RSG, and O-rich AGBs in the 2MASS, GLIMPSE, and MSX
catalogs, and we analyzed their properties with near- and mid-infrared
color-color diagrams. We used the Q1 parameter, which measures the deviation
from the interstellar reddening vector in the J-H versus H-Ks diagram, and we
defined a new parameter, Q2, that measures the deviation from the interstellar
reddening vector in the J-Ks versus Ks-[8.0] diagram. The latter plane enables
to distinguish between interstellar and circumstellar reddening, and to
identify stars with envelopes. WR stars and late-type mass-losing stars are
distributed in two different regions of the Q1 versus Ks-[8.0] diagram. A
sequence of increasing [3.6]-[4.5] and [3.6]-[8.0] colors with increasing
pulsation amplitudes (SRs, Miras, and OH/IRs) is found. Spectra of Miras and
OH/IRs have stronger H2O absorption at 3.0um than SRs or most of the RSGs.
Masing Miras have H2O, but stronger SiO (~ 4 um) and CO2 absorption (~4.25 um),
as suggested by their bluer [3.6]-[4.5] colors. A fraction of RSGs (22%) have
the bluest [3.6]-[4.5] colors, but small Q2 values. We propose a new set of
photometric criteria to distinguish among IR bright Galactic stars. The GLIMPSE
catalog is a powerful tool for photometric classification of mass-losing
evolved stars. Our new criteria will yield many new RSGs and WRs.

rising and cooler downward-sinking material -- the top of the deep-reaching
solar convection zone. Convection plays a role for the thermal structure of the
solar interior and the dynamo acting there, for the stratification of the
photosphere, where most of the visible light is emitted, as well as for the
energy budget of the spectacular processes in the chromosphere and corona.
Convective stellar atmospheres can be modeled by numerically solving the
coupled equations of (magneto)hydrodynamics and non-local radiation transport
in the presence of a gravity field. The CO5BOLD code described in this article
is designed for so-called ""realistic"" simulations that take into account the
detailed microphysics under the conditions in solar or stellar surface layers
(equation-of-state and optical properties of the matter). These simulations
indeed deserve the label ""realistic"" because they reproduce the various
observables very well -- with only minor differences between different
implementations. The agreement with observations has improved over time and the
simulations are now well-established and have been performed for a number of
stars. Still, severe challenges are encountered when it comes to extending
these simulations to include ideally the entire star or substellar object: the
strong stratification leads to completely different conditions in the interior,
the photosphere, and the corona. Simulations have to account for a large range
of spatial and time scales and also non-equilibrium processes. Last but not
least, realistic simulations are based on detailed microphysics and depend on
the quality of the input data. This article provides an overview of the
physical problem and the numerical solution and the capabilities of CO5BOLD,
illustrated with a number of applications.

materials. Previously, studies of the SHE have been motivated primarily to
understand its fundamental origin and magnitude. Here we demonstrate, using
measurement and modeling, that in a Pt/Co bilayer with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy the SHE can produce a spin transfer torque that is strong enough to
efficiently rotate and reversibly switch the Co magnetization, thereby
providing a new strategy both to understand the SHE and to manipulate magnets.
We suggest that the SHE torque can have a similarly strong influence on
current-driven magnetic domain wall motion in Pt/ferromagnet multilayers. We
estimate that in optimized devices the SHE torque can switch magnetic moments
using currents comparable to those in magnetic tunnel junctions operated by
conventional spin-torque switching, meaning that the SHE can enable magnetic
memory and logic devices with similar performance but simpler architecture than
the current state of the art.

flashes of astronomical origin and other light sources variable on short
timescales. We search mainly for optical emission of Gamma Ray Bursts, but also
for variable stars, novae, etc. This task requires an accurate measurement of
the brightness, which is difficult as ""Pi of the Sky"" single camera has a field
of view of about 20*20 deg. This causes a significant deformation of a point
spread function (PSF), reducing quality of measurements with standard
algorithms. Improvement requires a careful study and modelling of PSF, which is
the main topic of the presented thesis. A dedicated laboratory setup has been
created for obtaining isolated, high quality profiles, which in turn were used
as the input for mathematical models. Two different models are shown:
diffractive, simulating light propagation through lenses and effective,
modelling the PSF shape in the image plane.
  The effective model, based on PSF parametrization with selected Zernike
polynomials describes the data well and was used in photometry and astrometry
analysis. No improvement compared to standard algorithms was observed in
photometry, however more than factor of 2 improvement in astrometry accuracy
was reached for bright stars. Additionally, the model was used to recalculate
limits on the optical precursor to GRB080319B - a limit higher by 0.75 mag
compared to previous calculations has been obtained.
  The PSF model was also used to develop a dedicated tool to generate Monte
Carlo samples of images corresponding to the ""Pi of the Sky"" observations. The
simulator allows for a detailed reproduction of the frame as seen by our
cameras. A comparison of photometry performed on real and simulated data
resulted in very similar results, proving the simulator a worthy tool for
future ""Pi of the Sky"" hardware and software development.
