class of f(R) gravity which arises from string theory and their possible
imprint in Cosmic Microwave Background. In fact, in the very early universe
these relic gravitons could have acted as slow gravity waves. They may have
then acted to focus the geodesics of radiation and matter. Therefore, their
imprint on the later evolution of the universe could appear as filaments and
domain wall in the Universe today. In that case, the effect on Cosmic Microwave
Background should be analogous to the effect of water waves, which, in focusing
light, create optical caustics which are commonly seen on the bottom of
swimming pools. We analyze this important issue by showing how relic massive
GWs perturb the trajectories of Cosmic Microwave Background photons
(gravitational lensing by relic GWs). The consequence of the type of physics
discussed is outlined by illustrating an amplification of what might be called
optical chaos.

the simplest example of strong electronic correlation in low dimensions. In
particular, we prove that numerical accuracy comparable to that of benchmark
density matrix renormalization group calculations can be achieved by using a
highly correlated Jastrow-antisymmetrized geminal power variational wave
function. Furthermore, by using the so-called ""modern theory of polarization""
and by studying the spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations functions, we have
characterized in details the crossover between the weakly and strongly
correlated regimes of this atomic chain. Our results show that variational
Monte Carlo provides an accurate and flexible alternative to highly correlated
methods of quantum chemistry which, at variance with these methods, can be also
applied to a strongly correlated solid in low dimensions close to a crossover
or a phase transition.

long range structural measurements were complemented by ab initio molecular

no large atomic (bond distances or thermal factors), electronic structure
changes or rehybridization on crossing TFE from local structural methods. The
local symmetry about the Mn sites is preserved. With respect to the local
structure about the Ho sites, a reduction of the average Ho-O bond with
increased temperature is found. Ab initio molecular dynamics calculations on
HoMnO3 reveal the detailed motions of all ions. Above ~900 K there are large
displacements of the Ho, O3 and O4 ions along the z-axis which reduce the
buckling of the MnO3/O4 planes. The changes result in O3/O4 ions moving to
towards central points between pairs of Ho ions on the z-axis. These structural
changes make the coordination of Ho sites more symmetric thus extinguishing the
electric polarization. At significantly higher temperatures, rotation of the
MnO5 polyhedra occurs without a significant change in electric polarization.
The born effective charge tensor is found to be highly anisotropic at the O
sites but does not change appreciably at high temperatures.

is fundamentally a convolution of the cross-section for the hard X-ray emission
process(es) in question with the electron distribution function, which is in
turn a function of energy, direction, spatial location and time. To address the
problems of particle propagation and acceleration one needs to infer as much
information as possible on this electron distribution function, through a
deconvolution of this fundamental relationship. This review presents recent
progress toward this goal using spectroscopic, imaging and polarization
measurements, primarily from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI). Previous conclusions regarding the energy, angular (pitch
angle) and spatial distributions of energetic electrons in solar flares are
critically reviewed. We discuss the role and the observational evidence of
several radiation processes: free-free electron-ion, free-free
electron-electron, free-bound electron-ion bremsstrahlung, photoelectric
absorption and Compton back-scatter (albedo), using both spectroscopic and
imaging techniques. This unprecedented quality of data allows for the first
time inference of the angular distributions of the X-ray-emitting electrons
using albedo, improved model-independent inference of electron energy spectra
and emission measures of thermal plasma. Moreover, imaging spectroscopy has
revealed hitherto unknown details of solar flare morphology and detailed
spectroscopy of coronal, footpoint and extended sources in flaring regions.
Additional attempts to measure hard X-ray polarization were not sufficient to
put constraints on the degree of anisotropy of electrons, but point to the
importance of obtaining good quality polarization data.

parameters. The sample stars clearly trace a typical thick disk population with
peaks at |Z|=1.26 kpc and [Fe/H]=-0.54. The vertical metallicity gradient of
the thick disk is estimated in two ways. One is a fit to the Gaussian peaks of
the metallicity histograms of the thick disk by subtracting minor contributions
from the thin disk and the inner halo based on the Besancon Galaxy model. The
resulting gradient is -0.12+-0.01 dex/kpc for 0.5 <|Z| <3 kpc. The other method
is to linearly fit the data based on stars with 1 <|Z| <3 kpc being the main
component of the thick disk. Five subgroups are then selected in different
directions in the X-|Z| plane to investigate the difference in the vertical
metallicity gradient between the Galactocenter and anti-Galactocenter
directions. We found that a vertical gradient o-0.22+-0.07 dex/kpc is detected
for five directions except for one involving the pollution of stars from the
bulge. The results indicate that the vertical gradient is dominant, but a
radial gradient has a minor contribution for the thick disk population

the existence of a metallicity gradient in the thick disk, which is thought to

reconciling differences in subjective preferences. In contrast, a dominant line
of work in the theory of voting over the past 15 years has considered a
different kind of scenario, also fundamental to voting, in which there is a
genuinely ""best"" outcome that voters would agree on if they only had enough
information. This type of scenario has its roots in the classical Condorcet
Jury Theorem; it includes cases such as jurors in a criminal trial who all want
to reach the correct verdict but disagree in their inferences from the
available evidence, or a corporate board of directors who all want to improve
the company's revenue, but who have different information that favors different
options.
  This style of voting leads to a natural set of questions: each voter has a
{\em private signal} that provides probabilistic information about which option
is best, and a central question is whether a simple plurality voting system,
which tabulates votes for different options, can cause the group decision to
arrive at the correct option. We show that plurality voting is powerful enough
to achieve this: there is a way for voters to map their signals into votes for
options in such a way that --- with sufficiently many voters --- the correct
option receives the greatest number of votes with high probability. We show
further, however, that any process for achieving this is inherently expensive
in the number of voters it requires: succeeding in identifying the correct
option with probability at least $1 - \eta$ requires $\Omega(n^3 \epsilon^{-2}
\log \eta^{-1})$ voters, where $n$ is the number of options and $\epsilon$ is a
distributional measure of the minimum difference between the options.

[Divoux et al., {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.}, 2010, {\bf 104}, 208301], we show that
the fluidization process of this simple yield stress fluid involves a transient
shear-banding regime whose duration $\tau_f$ decreases as a power law of the
applied shear rate $\gp$. Here we go one step further by an exhaustive
investigation of the influence of the shearing geometry through the gap width
$e$ and the boundary conditions. While slip conditions at the walls seem to
have a negligible influence on the fluidization time $\tau_f$, different
fluidization processes are observed depending on $\gp$ and $e$: the shear band
remains almost stationary for several hours at low shear rates or small gap
widths before strong fluctuations lead to a homogeneous flow, whereas at larger
values of $\gp$ or $e$, the transient shear band is seen to invade the whole
gap in a much smoother way. Still, the power-law behaviour appears as very
robust and hints to critical-like dynamics. To further discuss these results,
we propose (i) a qualitative scenario to explain the induction-like period that
precedes full fluidization and (ii) an analogy with critical phenomena that
naturally leads to the observed power laws if one assumes that the yield point
is the critical point of an underlying out-of-equilibrium phase transition.

source locations and the ARs automatically extracted from magnetic synoptic
charts of Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) during 1997 -- 1998. It is found that
about 63% of the CMEs are related with ARs, at least about 53% of the ARs
produced one or more CMEs, and particularly about 14% of ARs are CME-rich (3 or
more CMEs were generated) during one transit across the visible disk. Several
issues are then tried to clarify: whether or not the CMEs originating from ARs
are distinct from others, whether or not the CME kinematics depend on AR
properties, and whether or not the CME productivity depends on AR properties.
The statistical results suggest that (1) there is no evident difference between
AR-related and non-AR-related CMEs in terms of CME speed, acceleration and
width, (2) the size, strength and complexity of ARs do little with the
kinematic properties of CMEs, but have significant effects on the CME
productivity, and (3) the sunspots in all the most productive ARs at least

(1) the distribution of the waiting time of same-AR CMEs, consists of two parts
with a separation at about 15 hours, which implies that the CMEs with a waiting
time shorter than 15 hours are probably truly physical related, and (2) an AR
tends to produce such related same-AR CMEs at a pace of 8 hours, but cannot
produce two or more fast CMEs (>800 km/s) within a time interval of 15 hours.
This interesting phenomenon is particularly discussed.

two-dimensional semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) that lives in
the nonnegative quadrant. The SRBM data can equivalently be specified by three
geometric objects, an ellipse and two lines, in the two-dimensional Euclidean
space. First, we revisit the variational problem (VP) associated with the SRBM.
Building on Avram, Dai and Hasenbein (2001), we show that the value of the VP
at a point in the quadrant is equal to the optimal value of a linear function
over a convex domain. Depending on the location of the point, the convex domain
is either D(1) or D(2) or D(1) cap D(2), where each D(i), i = 1, 2, can easily
be described by the three geometric objects. Our results provide a geometric
interpretation for the value function of the VP and allow one to see
geometrically when one edge of the quadrant has influence on the optimal path
traveling from the origin to a destination point. Second, we provide a
geometric condition that characterizes the existence of a product form
stationary distribution. Third, we establish exact tail asymptotics of two
boundary measures that are associated with the stationary distribution; a key
step in our proof is to sharpen two asymptotic inversion lemmas in Dai and
Miyazawa (2011) that allow one to infer the exact tail asymptotic of a boundary
measure from the singularity of its moment generating function.

and particle acceleration in flares are summarized. RHESSI's precise
measurements of hard X-ray continuum spectra enable model-independent
deconvolution to obtain the parent electron spectrum. Taking into account the
effects of albedo, these show that the low energy cut-off to the electron
power-law spectrum is typically below tens of keV, confirming that the
accelerated electrons contain a large fraction of the energy released in
flares. RHESSI has detected a high coronal hard X-ray source that is filled
with accelerated electrons whose energy density is comparable to the
magnetic-field energy density. This suggests an efficient conversion of energy,
previously stored in the magnetic field, into the bulk acceleration of
electrons. A new, collisionless (Hall) magnetic reconnection process has been
identified through theory and simulations, and directly observed in space and
in the laboratory; it should occur in the solar corona as well, with a
reconnection rate fast enough for the energy release in flares. The
reconnection process could result in the formation of multiple elongated
magnetic islands, that then collapse to bulk-accelerate the electrons, rapidly
enough to produce the observed hard X-ray emissions. RHESSI's pioneering
{\gamma}-ray line imaging of energetic ions, revealing footpoints straddling a
flare loop arcade, has provided strong evidence that ion acceleration is also
related to magnetic reconnection. Flare particle acceleration is shown to have
a close relationship to impulsive Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events
observed in the interplanetary medium, and also to both fast coronal mass
ejections and gradual SEP events.

negative dynamic conductivity and promotes the realization of terahertz lasing.
On the other hand, the heating of optical phonon system can also be crucial
affecting the realization of negative dynamic conductivity and terahertz lasing
at the room temperatures.

intended to demonstrate the only practical solution to providing high
brilliance beams necessary for a neutrino factory or muon collider. MICE is
under development at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the United
Kingdom. It comprises a dedicated beamline to generate a range of input muon
emittances and momenta, with time-of-flight and Cherenkov detectors to ensure a
pure muon beam. The emittance of the incoming beam will be measured in the
upstream magnetic spectrometer with a scintillating fiber tracker. A cooling
cell will then follow, alternating energy loss in Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)
absorbers to RF cavity acceleration. A second spectrometer, identical to the
first, and a second muon identification system will measure the outgoing
emittance. In the 2010 run at RAL the muon beamline and most detectors were
fully commissioned and a first measurement of the emittance of the muon beam
with particle physics (time-of-flight) detectors was performed. The analysis of
these data was recently completed and is discussed in this paper. Future steps
for MICE, where beam emittance and emittance reduction (cooling) are to be
measured with greater accuracy, are also presented.

(PMN) survey and at 1400 MHz in the NRAO/VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). There is an
excellent match in morphological structure between the optical (HAlpha) and
radio emission. We subsequently obtained optical spectroscopy of selected
HAlpha filaments using the South African Astronomical Observatory 1.9-m
telescope which confirmed shock excitation typical of supernova remnants. Our
discovery of HAlpha emission and the positional match with several radio
frequency maps led us to reassign G213.0-0.6 as G213.3-0.4 as these
co-ordinates more accurately reflect the actual centre of the SNR shell and
hence the most probable place of the original supernova explosion. Support for
this new SNR ID comes from the fact that the X-ray source 1RXS J065049.7-003220
is situated in the centre of this new remnant and could be connected with the
supernova explosion.

cycle are computed by spatially integrating the precipitation, evaporation, and
runoff fields using the Voronoi-Thiessen tessellation formalism. The span of
the model simulated mean annual water balances is of the same order of
magnitude of the observed Danube discharge of the Delta; the true value is
within the range simulated by the models. Some land components seem to have
deficiencies since there are cases of violation of water conservation when
annual means are considered. The overall performance and the degree of
agreement of the GCMs are comparable to those of the RCMs analyzed in a
previous work, in spite of the much higher resolution and common nesting of the
RCMs. The reanalyses are shown to feature several inconsistencies and cannot be
used as a verification benchmark for the hydrological cycle in the Danubian
region. In the scenario runs, for basically all models the water balance
decreases, whereas its interannual variability increases. Changes in the
strength of the hydrological cycle are not consistent among models: it is
confirmed that capturing the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle
is not an easy task over land areas. Moreover, in several cases we find that
qualitatively different behaviours emerge among the models: the ensemble mean
does not represent any sort of average model, and often it falls between the

hemisphere are analyzed, each of which is local and over 200 years in length,
as well as two reconstructed long-range yearly records - from a stalagmite and
from tree rings that are about 2000 years long. In the instrumental records,
the steepest 100-year temperature fall happened in the 19th century and the
steepest rise in the 20th century, both events being of about the same
magnitude. Evaluation by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) yields Hurst
exponents that are in good agreement with the literature. DFA, Monte Carlo
simulations, and synthetic records reveal that both 100-year events were caused
by external trends. In contrast to this, the reconstructed records show
stronger 100-year rises and falls as quite common during the last 2000 years.
These results contradict the hypothesis of an unusual (anthropogenic) global
warming during the 20th century. As a hypothesis, the sun's magnetic field,
which is correlated with sunspot numbers, is put forward as an explanation. The
long-term low-frequency fluctuations in sunspot numbers are not detectable by
the DFA in the monthly instrumental records, resulting in the common low Hurst
exponents. The same does not hold true for the 2000-year-long reconstructed
records, which explains both their higher Hurst exponents and the higher
probabilities of strong 100-year temperature fluctuations. A long-term
synthetic record that embodies the reconstructed sunspot number fluctuations
includes the different Hurst exponents of both the instrumental and the
reconstructed records and, therefore, corroborates the conjecture.

where processes are prone to crash failures and have no initial knowledge of

same identifier). New classes of failure detectors suited to these systems are
first defined. Among them, the classes H\Omega\ and H\Sigma\ are introduced
that are the homonymous counterparts of the classes \Omega\ and \Sigma,
respectively. (Recall that the pair <\Omega,\Sigma> defines the weakest failure
detector to solve consensus.) Then, the paper shows how H\Omega\ and H\Sigma\
can be implemented in homonymous systems without membership knowledge (under
different synchrony requirements). Finally, two algorithms are presented that
use these failure detectors to solve consensus in homonymous asynchronous
systems where there is no initial knowledge of the membership. One algorithm
solves consensus with <H\Omega,H\Sigma>, while the other uses only H\Omega, but
needs a majority of correct processes.
  Observe that the systems with unique identifiers and anonymous systems are
extreme cases of homonymous systems from which follows that all these results
also apply to these systems. Interestingly, the new failure detector class
H\Omega\ can be implemented with partial synchrony, while the analogous class
A\Omega\ defined for anonymous systems can not be implemented (even in
synchronous systems). Hence, the paper provides us with the first proof showing
that consensus can be solved in anonymous systems with only partial synchrony
(and a majority of correct processes).

quandles of order $n$. When the elements of such a quandle $Q$ are already
ordered naturally, any automophism on $Q$ is a natural ordering. Although there
are many natural orderings, the operation tables for such orderings coincide
when the permutation $*q$ is a cycle of length $n-1$. This leads to the
classification of automorphisms on such a quandle. Moreover, it is also shown
that every row and column of the operation table of such a quandle contains all
the elements of $Q$, which is due to K. Oshiro. We also consider the general
case of finite connected quandles.

field theory models, namely the minimal standard model extension (SME) and the
standard model supplement (SMS). From the requirement of the identity of the
intersection for the two models, we find that the free photon sector of the SMS
can be a subset of the photon sector of the minimal SME. We not only obtain
some relations between the SME parameters, but also get some constraints on the
SMS parameters from the SME parameters. The CPT-odd coefficients
$(k_{AF})^{\alpha}$ of the SME are predicted to be zero. There are 15 degrees
of freedom in the Lorentz violation matrix $\Delta^{\alpha\beta}$ of free
photons of the SMS related with the same number of degrees of freedom in the
tensor coefficients $(k_F)^{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$, which are independent from
each other in the minimal SME, but are inter-related in the intersection of the
SMS and the minimal SME. With the related degrees of freedom, we obtain the
conservative constraints ($2\sigma$) on the elements of the photon Lorentz
violation matrix. The detailed structure of the photon Lorentz violation matrix
suggests some applications to the Lorentz violation experiments for photons.

  Tamassia","Oblivious Storage with Low I/O Overhead",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study oblivious storage (OS), a natural way to model privacy-preserving
data outsourcing where a client, Alice, stores sensitive data at an
honest-but-curious server, Bob. We show that Alice can hide both the content of
her data and the pattern in which she accesses her data, with high probability,
using a method that achieves O(1) amortized rounds of communication between her
and Bob for each data access. We assume that Alice and Bob exchange small
messages, of size $O(N^{1/c})$, for some constant $c\ge2$, in a single round,
where $N$ is the size of the data set that Alice is storing with Bob. We also
assume that Alice has a private memory of size $2N^{1/c}$. These assumptions
model real-world cloud storage scenarios, where trade-offs occur between
latency, bandwidth, and the size of the client's private memory.
