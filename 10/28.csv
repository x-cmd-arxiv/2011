and the polynomial hierarchy, and showed that an oracle separating the decision
versions would follow from what we called the Generalized Linial-Nisan (GLN)
Conjecture: that ""almost k-wise independent"" distributions are
indistinguishable from the uniform distribution by constant-depth circuits. The
original Linial-Nisan Conjecture was recently proved by Braverman; we offered a
$200 prize for the generalized version. In this paper, we save ourselves $200
by showing that the GLN Conjecture is false, at least for circuits of depth 3
and higher. As a byproduct, our counterexample also implies that Pi2P is not
contained in P^NP relative to a random oracle with probability 1. It has been
conjectured since the 1980s that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle,
but the highest levels of PH previously proved separate were NP and coNP.
Finally, our counterexample implies that the famous results of Linial, Mansour,
and Nisan, on the structure of AC0 functions, cannot be improved in several
interesting respects.

delay tolerant network in which a message (or a file) has to be delivered to
each of several destinations by epidemic relaying. In addition to the
destinations, there are several other nodes in the network that can assist in
relaying the message. We first assume that, at every instant, all the nodes
know the number of relays carrying the packet and the number of destinations
that have received the packet. We formulate the problem as a controlled
continuous time Markov chain and derive the optimal closed loop control (i.e.,
forwarding policy). However, in practice, the intermittent connectivity in the
network implies that the nodes may not have the required perfect knowledge of
the system state. To address this issue, we obtain an ODE (i.e., a
deterministic fluid) approximation for the optimally controlled Markov chain.
This fluid approximation also yields an asymptotically optimal open loop
policy. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the deterministic policy over
finite networks. Numerical results show that this policy performs close to the
optimal closed loop policy.

  In our baseline design of GraXe, a sphere made of graphene-coated titanium
mesh and filled with liquid xenon (LXe) enriched in the Xe-136 isotope is
immersed in a large volume of natural LXe instrumented with photodetectors.
Liquid xenon is an excellent scintillator, reasonably transparent to its own
light. Graphene is transparent over a large frequency range, and impermeable to
the xenon. Event position could be deduced from the light pattern detected in
the photosensors. External backgrounds would be shielded by the buffer of
natural LXe, leaving the ultra-radiopure internal volume virtually free of
background.
  Industrial graphene can be manufactured at a competitive cost to produce the
sphere. Enriching xenon in the isotope Xe-136 is easy and relatively cheap, and
there is already near one ton of enriched xenon available in the world
(currently being used by the EXO, KamLAND-Zen and NEXT experiments). All the
cryogenic know-how is readily available from the numerous experiments using
liquid xenon. An experiment using the GraXe concept appears realistic and
affordable in a short time scale, and its physics potential is enormous.

some more fundamental degrees of freedom that remain unknown, in many ways
similar to the treatment of fluid dynamics via the Navier-Stokes equations.
This led us to ask how a geometric structure may naturally arise in
thermodynamics or statistical mechanics and what evolution may mean in this
context. In this article we argue that it is possible to view thermodynamic
processes as the evolution of a dynamical system, described by a quadratic
Lagrangian and a metric on the thermodynamic configuration space. The
Lagrangian is an invariant distance between equilibrium thermodynamic states as
defined by the metric, which is straightforwardly obtained from a complete set

solutions, for which already at early times, when the matter density is high,
the contribution of the graviton mass to the energy density is negative and
large enough to screen that of the matter contribution. The total energy can
then be negative, which may result in removing the initial singularity. For
special parameter values there are also solutions for which the two metrics

\emph{optimal} Golomb rulers (those of minimal length given a fixed number of
markings). Our goal is to enumerate Golomb rulers in a systematic way: we study
[g_m(t) := # {\x \in \Z^{m+1} : \, 0 = x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_{m-1} < x_m = t,
\text{all} x_j - x_k \text{distinct}},] the number of Golomb rulers with $m+1$

in $t$ which satisfies a combinatorial reciprocity theorem: $(-1)^{m-1}
g_m(-t)$ equals the number of rulers $\x$ of length $t$ with $m+1$ markings,
each counted with its \emph{Golomb multiplicity}, which measures how many
combinatorially different Golomb rulers are in a small neighborhood of $\x$.
Our reciprocity theorem can be interpreted in terms of certain mixed graphs
associated to Golomb rulers; in this language, it is reminiscent of Stanley's
reciprocity theorem for chromatic polynomials. Thus in the second part of the

with the natural isometric action of R^2 on the algebra of the Moyal plane A.
We show that the distance between any state of A and any of its translated is
precisely the amplitude of the translation. As a consequence, we obtain the
spectral distance between coherent states of the quantum harmonic oscillator as
the Euclidean distance on the plane. We investigate the classical limit,
showing that the set of coherent states equipped with Connes' spectral distance
tends towards the Euclidean plane as the parameter of deformation goes to zero.
The extension of these results to the action of the symplectic group is also
discussed, with particular emphasize on the orbits of coherent states under
rotations. Second, we compute the spectral distance in the double Moyal plane,
intended as the product of (the minimal unitization of) A by C^2. We show that
on the set of states obtained by translation of an arbitrary state of A, this
distance is given by Pythagoras theorem. On the way, we prove some Pythagoras
inequalities for the product of arbitrary unital & non-degenerate spectral
triples. Applied to the Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts model of quantum

chromo-field flux sheets whose spatial cross sections are three-dimensional
chromo-field flux tubes. In lattice simulations, they may be detected as center
vortices. The first set of gauge field configurations generates chromo-electric
flux tubes that should contribute to a chromo-electric flux tube between two
static color charges. The string tension for two static color charges in
representation r then naturally satisfies the Casimir scaling. Applying a gauge
transformation to this set of gauge field configurations, we can transform them
into those in the maximal Abelian gauge. These transformed configurations
generate chromo-electric flux tubes that should contribute to those observed
between two static quarks in lattice simulations performed in the maximal
Abelian gauge. The second set of gauge field configurations generates
chromo-magnetic flux tubes. When rotated in a plane that includes the
temporal-axis and is perpendicular to the flux tube axis, the rotated gauge
field configuration generates a chromo-electric flux tube and should contribute
to the chromo-electric flux tubes observed in lattice simulations in the Landau
gauge. We also argue that when regulated on a lattice, any of the flux sheet
gauge field configuration with a finite flux sheet thickness is located on the
Gribov horizon in the infinite lattice volume limit. We thus suggest that these

spectral peak Epk and its isotropic equivalent energy Eiso through the use of a
population synthesis code to model the prompt gamma-ray emission from GRBs. By
using prescriptions for the distribution of prompt spectral parameters as well
as the population's luminosity function and co-moving rate density, I generate
a simulated population of GRBs and examine how bursts of varying spectral
properties and redshift would appear to a gamma-ray detector here on Earth. I
find that a strong observed correlation can be produced between the source
frame Epk and Eiso for the detected population despite the existence of only a
weak and broad correlation in the original simulated population. The energy
dependance of a gamma-ray detector's flux-limited detection threshold acts to
produce a correlation between the source frame Epk and Eiso for low luminosity
GRBs, producing the left boundary of the observed correlation. Conversely, very
luminous GRBs are found at higher redshifts than their low luminosity
counterparts due to the standard Malquest bias, causing bursts in the low Epk,
high Eiso regime to go undetected because their Epk values would be redshifted
to energies at which most gamma-ray detectors become less sensitive. I argue
that it is this previously unexamined effect which produces the right boundary
of the observed correlation. Therefore, the origin of the observed correlation
is a complex combination of the instrument's detection threshold, the intrinsic
cutoff in the GRB luminosity function, and the broad range of redshifts over
which GRBs are detected. These simulations serve to demonstrate how selection
effects caused by a combination of instrumental sensitivity and the
cosmological nature of an astrophysical population can act to produce an
artificially strong correlation between observed properties.

a weak but significant assembly-type bias, where old central galaxies have a
higher clustering amplitude (61 $\pm$ 9 per cent) at scales > 1 Mpc than young
central galaxies of equal host halo mass ($M_{h} \sim 10^{11.8} h^{-1}$
$M_{\odot}$). The observational sample is volume-limited out to z=0.1 with $M_r
-$ 5 log$(h) \le -19.6$. We construct a mock catalogue of galaxies that shows a
similar signal of assembly bias (46 $\pm$ 9 per cent) at the same halo mass. We
then adapt the model presented by Lacerna & Padilla (Paper I) to redefine the
overdensity peak height, which traces the assembly bias such that galaxies in
equal density peaks show the same clustering regardless of their stellar age,
but this time using observational features such as a flux limit. The proxy for
peak height, which is proposed as a better alternative than the virial mass,
consists in the total mass given by the mass of neighbour host haloes in
cylinders centred at each central galaxy. The radius of the cylinder is
parametrized as a function of stellar age and virial mass. The best-fitting set
of parameters that make the assembly bias signal lower than 5$-$15 per cent for
both SDSS and mock central galaxies are similar. The idea behind the
parametrization is not to minimize the bias, but it is to use this method to
understand the physical features that produce the assembly bias effect. Even
though the tracers of the density field used here differ significantly from
those used in paper I, our analysis of the simulated catalogue indicates that
the different tracers produce correlated proxies, and therefore the reason
behind this assembly bias is the crowding of peaks in both simulations and the
SDSS.

pulsed GRBs at a variety of redshifts and observe how their light curves would
appear to a gamma-ray detector here on Earth. We find that the observer frame
duration of individual pulses does not increase as a function of redshift as
one would expect from the cosmological expansion of a
Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe. In fact, the duration of
individual pulses is seen to decrease as their signal-to-noise decreases with
increasing redshift, as only the brightest portion of a high redshift GRB's
light curve is accessible to the detector. The results of our simulation are
consistent with the fact that a systematic broadening of GRB durations as a
function of redshift has not materialized in either the Swift or Fermi detected
GRBs with known redshift. We show that this fundamental duration bias implies
that the measured durations and associated Eiso estimates for GRBs detected
near an instrument's detection threshold should be considered lower limits to
their true values. We conclude by predicting that the average peak-to-peak time
for a large number of multi-pulsed GRBs as a function of redshift may
eventually provide the evidence for time dilation that has so far eluded
detection.

examples of elliptic fibrations admitting a rich spectrum of singular fibers
(not all on the list of Kodaira) without introducing singularities in the total
space of the fibration and therefore avoiding a discussion of their
resolutions. We study systematically the fiber geometry of such fibrations
using Segre symbols and compute several topological invariants.
  We present for the first time Sen's (orientifold) limits for D5 elliptic
fibrations. These orientifolds limit describe different weak coupling limits of
F-theory to type IIB string theory giving a system of three brane-image-brane
pairs in presence of a Z_2 orientifold. The orientifold theory is
mathematically described by the double cover the base of the elliptic
fibration. Such orientifold theories are characterized by a transition from a
semi-stable singular fiber to an unstable one. In this paper, we describe the
first example of a weak coupling limit in F-theory characterized by a
transition to a non-Kodaira (and non-ADE) fiber. Inspired by string dualities,
we obtain non-trivial topological relations connecting the elliptic fibration
and the different loci that appear in its weak coupling limit. Mathematically,
these are surprising relations relating the total Chern class of the D5
elliptic fibration and those of different loci that naturally appear in the
weak coupling limit. We work in arbitrary dimension and our results don't

good agreement with existing hot Jupiter systems. We find that in the case of
modest irradiation received from the stellar host, giant planets do not have

particles decaying into final states with missing transverse momentum and
exactly two isolated leptons, e or mu. The analysis uses a data sample
collected during the first half of 2011 that corresponds to a total integrated
luminosity of 1 fb^-1 of sqrt{s} = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded with
the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Opposite-sign and same-sign
dilepton events are separately studied, with no deviations from the Standard
Model expectation observed. Additionally, in opposite- sign events, a search is
made for an excess of same-flavour over different-flavour lepton pairs.
Effective production cross sections in excess of 9.9 fb for opposite-sign
events containing supersymmetric particles with missing transverse momentum
greater than 250 GeV are excluded at 95% CL. For same-sign events containing
supersymmetric particles with missing transverse momentum greater than 100 GeV,
effective production cross sections in excess of 14.8 fb are excluded at 95%
CL. The latter limit is interpreted in a simplified weak gaugino production
model excluding chargino masses up to 200 GeV.

candles to reveal the accelerating universe even though fundamental details,

a mystery. There is consensus that a white dwarf star explodes after accreting
matter in a binary system, but the secondary could be anything from a main
sequence star to a red giant, or even another white dwarf. The uncertainty
stems from the fact that no recent SN Ia has been discovered close enough to
detect the stars before explosion. Here we report early observations of SN
2011fe (PTF11kly) in M101 at a distance of 6.4 Mpc, the closest SN Ia in the
past 25 years. We find that the exploding star was likely a carbon-oxygen white
dwarf, and from the lack of an early shock we conclude that the companion was
most likely a main sequence star. Early spectroscopy shows high-velocity oxygen
that varies on a time scale of hours and extensive mixing of newly synthesized
intermediate mass elements in the outermost layers of the supernova. A
companion paper uses pre-explosion images to rule out luminous red giants and

(HST). We use HST surveys to place bounds on the numbers of SMDSs that may be
detected in future JWST imaging surveys. We showed that SMDS in the mass range
$10^6-10^7 M_\odot$ are bright enough to be detected in all the wavelength
bands of the NIRCam on JWST . If SMDSs exist at z ~10, 12, and 14, they will be
detectable as J-band, H-band, or K-band dropouts, respectively. With a total
survey area of 150 arcmin^2 (assuming a multi-year deep parallel survey with
JWST), we find that typically the number of $10^6 M_\odot$ SMDSs found as H or
K-band dropouts is ~10^5\fsmds, where the fraction of early DM haloes hosting
DS is likely to be small, \fsmds<<1. If the SDMS survive down to z=10 where HST
bounds apply, then the observable number of SMDSs as H or K-band dropouts with
JWST is ~1-30. While individual SMDS are bright enough to be detected by JWST,
standard PopIII stars are not, and would only be detected in first galaxies
with total stellar masses of ~$10^6-10^8 M_\odot$. Differentiating first
galaxies at z>10 from SMDSs would be possible with spectroscopy: the SMDS
(which are too cool produce significant nebular emission) will have only
absorption lines while the galaxies are likely to produce emission lines as
well. Of particular interest would be the 1640 HeII emission line as well as
H{\alpha} lines which would be signatures of early galaxies rather than SMDSs.
The detection of SMDSs would not only provide alternative evidence for WIMPs
but would also provide possible seeds for the formation of supermassive black
holes that power QSOs at z~6.

exchanging the partitions in the corresponding ordered pair, and hence the

way. The infrared Coulomb branch of each theory can be studied using moment map
equations for a hyperKahler quotient of the Higgs branch of the mirror theory.
We focus on three infinite subclasses of these singular hyperKahler spaces

computed in order to count generators and relations, and they turn out to be
related to the corresponding partitions of the theories. For each theory, we
explicitly discuss the generators of such a space and relations they satisfy in

from the cosmic web using the Mare Nostrum hydro-cosmological simulation. Our
statistical sample consists of 350 dark-matter haloes of ~10^12 Msun at z =
2.5. We find that ~70% of the influx into the virial radius Rv is in narrow
streams covering 10% of the virial shell. On average 64% of the stream influx
is in one stream, and 95% is in three dominant streams. The streams that feed a
massive halo tend to lie in a plane that extends from half to a few Rv,
hereafter ""the stream plane"" (SP). The streams are typically embedded in a thin
sheet of low-entropy gas, a Zel'dovich pancake, which carries ~20% of the
influx into Rv. The filaments-in-a-plane configuration about the massive haloes
at the nodes of the cosmic web differs from the large- scale structure of the
web where the filaments mark the intersections of slanted sheets. The stream
plane is only weakly aligned with the angular momentum (AM) near Rv, consistent
with the fact that typically 80% of the AM is carried by one dominant stream.
The galactic disc plane shows a weak tendency to be perpendicular to the
large-scale SP, consistent with tidal-torque theory. Most interesting, the
direction of the disc AM is only weakly correlated with the AM direction at Rv.
This indicates a significant AM exchange at the interphase between streams and
disc in the greater environment of the disc inside an ""AM sphere"" of radius
~0.3Rv . The required large torques are expected based on the perturbed
morphology and kinematics within this interaction sphere. This AM exchange may
or may not require a major modification of the standard disc modeling based on
AM conservation, depending on the extent to which the amplitude of the disc AM
is affected, which is yet to be studied.

current densities) to the scalar and vector potentials in classical
electrodynamics, using Green function techniques. As is well known, the scalar
potential shows an action-at-a-distance behavior in Coulomb gauge. The
conundrum generated by the instantaneous interaction has intrigued physicists
for a long time. Starting from the differential equations that couple the
sources to the potentials, we here show in a concise derivation, using the
retarded Green function, how the instantaneous interaction cancels in the
calculation of the electric field. The time derivative of a specific additional
term in the vector potential, present only in Coulomb gauge, yields a
supplementary contribution to the electric field which cancels the gradient of
the instantaneous Coulomb gauge scalar potential, as required by gauge
invariance. This completely eliminates the contribution of the instantaneous
interaction from the electric field. It turns out that a careful formulation of
the retarded Green function, inspired by field theory, is required in order to
correctly treat boundary terms in partial integrations. Finally, compact
integral representations are derived for the Lienard-Wiechert potentials
(scalar and vector) in Coulomb gauge which manifestly contain two compensating
action-at-a-distance terms.

space with a constant volume, we study the role played by the closed string
tachyon in the cosmology of the effective four-dimensional space-time. The
effective tachyon potential consists on a negative constant related to the
internal curvature space and a polynomial with only quadratic and quartic terms
of the tachyon field. Based on it, we present a solution for the tachyon field
and the scale factor, which describes an accelerated universe which expands to
a maximum value before collapsing. At early times, the closed string tachyon
potential behaves as a cosmological constant driving the Universe to an
expansion. The value of the cosmological constant is determined by the
curvature of the internal space which also fixes the value of the vacuum
energy. As time evolves, inflation is present in our models, and it finishes
long before the collapsing. At late times, we show that the collapse of the
Universe starts as soon as the tachyon field condensates. We also comment on
the consistency of our solution at early times at which quantum aspects become
important under the perspective of quantum cosmology. Finally we briefly
mention the relation among the curvature of the internal space and the value of
the energy vacuum in a non-constant internal volume scenario.

that the dense gas is concentrated in several thin filaments. We find that a
few dust filaments are located at the parts where $^{12}$CO ($J=1-0$) emission
drops sharply. Furthermore, the filaments have two-components with different
velocities. The velocity difference between the two-components is about 3 km
s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a Mach number of 10, significantly larger than the
local turbulent velocity in the cloud. These facts imply that the collision of
the two components (hereafter, the cloud-cloud collision) possibly contributed
to the formation of these filaments. Since the two components appear to overlap
toward the filaments on the plane of the sky, the collision may have occurred
almost along the line of sight. Star formation in the L1641-N cluster was
probably triggered by such a collision. We also find several parsec-scale CO

powerlaw below 10keV, but show an additional hard excess at ~20keV in the
latter stages of the observation. This suggests that, in addition to the
variable powerlaw, there is a further variable component that varies with time

in a network using only observations about which set of nodes are infected with
  the rumor and with no information as to \emph{when} these nodes became
infected. In a recent work \citep{ref:rc} this rumor source detection problem
was introduced and studied. The authors proposed the graph score function {\em
rumor centrality} as an estimator for detecting the source. They establish it
to be the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the popular Susceptible
Infected (SI) model with exponential spreading times for regular trees. They
showed that as the size of the infected graph increases, for a path graph
(2-regular tree), the probability of source detection goes to $0$ while for
$d$-regular trees with $d \geq 3$ the probability of detection, say $\alpha_d$,
remains bounded away from $0$ and is less than $1/2$. However, their results
stop short of providing insights for the performance of the rumor centrality
estimator in more general settings such as irregular trees or the SI model with
non-exponential spreading times.
  This paper overcomes this limitation and establishes the effectiveness of
rumor centrality for source detection for generic random trees and the SI model
with a generic spreading time distribution. The key result is an interesting
connection between a continuous time branching process and the effectiveness of
rumor centrality. Through this, it is possible to quantify the detection
probability precisely. As a consequence, we recover all previous results as a
special case and obtain a variety of novel results including the {\em
universality} of rumor centrality in the context of tree-like graphs and the SI
model with a generic spreading time distribution.

  arXiv:0808.0340",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper presents new thermodynamic paradigm of chemical equilibrium,
setting forth comprehensive basics of Discrete Thermodynamics of Chemical
Equilibria (DTd). Along with previous results by the author during the last
decade, this work contains also some new developments of DTd. Based on the
Onsager's constitutive equations, reformulated by the author thermodynamic
affinity and reaction extent, and Le Chatelier's principle, DTd brings forward
a notion of chemical equilibrium as a balance of internal and external
thermodynamic forces (TdF), acting against a chemical system. Basic expression
of DTd is the chemical system logistic map of thermodynamic states that ties
together energetic characteristics of chemical reaction, occurring in the
system, the system shift from ""true"" thermodynamic equilibrium (TdE), and
causing that shift external thermodynamic forces. Solutions to the basic map
are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams in coordinates ""shift from TdE - growth
factor (or TdF)""; points, corresponding to the system thermodynamic states, are
dwelling on its branches. The diagrams feature three typical areas: true
thermodynamic equilibrium and open equilibrium along the thermodynamic branch
before the threshold of its stability, i.e. bifurcation point, and bifurcation
area with bistability and chaotic oscillations after the point. The set of
solutions makes up the chemical system domain of states. The new paradigm
complies with the correspondence principle: in isolated chemical system
external TdF vanish, and the basic map turns into traditional expression of
chemical equilibrium via thermodynamic affinity. The theory binds together
classical and contemporary thermodynamics of chemical equilibria on a unique
conceptual basis. The paper is essentially reworked and refocused version of
the earlier preprint on the DTd basics, supplemented with new results.

theoretical and experimental implications from relevant hadronic processes.
Especially, the angle between $\eta_c$ and $G$ is found to be about $11^\circ$
from the measured decay widths of the $\eta_c$ meson. The pseudoscalar glueball
mass $m_G$, the pseudoscalar densities $m_{qq,ss,cc}$ and the U(1) anomaly
matrix elements associated with the mixed states are solved from the anomalous
Ward identities. The solution $m_G\approx 1.4$ GeV obtained from the
$\eta$-$\eta'$-$G$ mixing is confirmed, while $m_{qq}$ grows to above the pion

$Br(B\to\eta'K)$. We then analyze the $\eta_c$-mixing effects on charmonium
magnetic dipole transitions, and on the $B\to\eta^{(\prime)}K_S$ branching
ratios and CP asymmetries, which further improve the consistency between
theoretical predictions and data. A predominant observation is that the
$\eta_c$ mixing enhances the perturbative QCD predictions for $Br(B\to\eta'K)$
by 18%, but does not alter those for $Br(B\to\eta K)$. The puzzle due to the
large $Br(B\to\eta'K)$ data is then resolved.

collaboration in 1.96 TeV p-pbar collisions is investigated within the standard

peak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass
energy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly
0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering
experiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very
different from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on
opposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic
scattering. We investigated effects of such variations in the strange-quark
distribution s(x) on the anomaly. We found that distributions of W+dijets and
other process are affected by the strange-quark modifications in wide
dijet-mass regions including the 140 GeV one. Since the CDF anomaly was
observed in the shoulder region of the dijet-mass distribution, a slight
modification of the distribution shape could explain at least partially the CDF
excess. Therefore, it is important to consider such effects within the standard
model for judging whether the CDF anomaly indicates new physics beyond the
standard model. We also show modification effects of the strange-quark
distribution in the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) kinematics, where cross

course of their functions. The changes in conformation are often attributable
to a small fraction of residues within the protein. Therefore identification of
these variable regions is important for an understanding of protein function.
  Results: We propose a novel method for identification of local conformational
changes in proteins. In our method, backbone conformations are encoded into a
sequence of letters from a 16-letter alphabet (called D2 codes) to perform
structural comparison. Since we do not use clustering analysis to encode local
structures, the D2 codes not only provides a intuitively understandable
description of protein structures, but also covers wide varieties of
distortions. This paper shows that the D2 codes are better correlated with
changes in the dihedral angles than a structural alphabet and a secondary
structure description. In the case of the N37S mutant of HIV-1 protease, local
conformational changes were captured by the D2 coding method more accurately
than other methods. The D2 coding also provided a reliable representation of
the difference between NMR models of an HIV-1 protease mutant.

critical point. In the present paper, we study this property in a model of
bistable molecules, whose size changes depending on the bistable states. The
molecules can move in space, interacting via an elastic interaction. It is
known that due to the different sizes, an effective long-range interaction
between the spins appears, and thus this model has a mean-field type of phase
transition. It is found that the scaling properties of the shift of the

infinite-range and short-range interactions hold also in the present model,
regarding the ratio of the size of the two states as a control parameter for
the strength of the long-range interaction. By studying the structure factor,
it is shown that the dependence of the cluster size at the critical temperature
also shows the same scaling properties as a previously studied model with both

moment orders along the crystallographic c axis and its effect on the iron
subsystem causes a reorientation of the ordered inplane Fe moments in a
direction out of the $ab$ plane. Application of magnetic field introduces
disorder in the AFM Pr sublattice, which, in turn, reduces the out-of-plane
Pr-Fe exchange interaction responsible for Fe spin reorientation. Both in
$\rho$($T$) and $d(C/T)/dT$ curves, the peak at $T_{SR}$ broadens with the
increase of $H$ due to the introduction of the disorder in the AFM Pr
sublattice by magnetic field. In $\rho$($T$) curve, the peak shifts towards
lower temperature with $H$ and disappears above 6 T while in $d(C/T)/dT$ curve
the peak remains visible up to 14 T. The broadening of the anomaly at
$T_N^{\rm{Pr}}$ in $C(T)$ with increasing $H$ further confirms that magnetic

Sub-Commission 33b on behalf of the IAU in 1958. For more than 50 years the
definition of the Galactic coordinate system has remained unchanged from this
IAU1958 version. On the basis of deep and all-sky catalogs, the position of the
Galactic plane can be revised and updated definitions of the Galactic
coordinate systems can be proposed. We re-determine the position of the
Galactic plane based on modern large catalogs, such as the Two Micron All-Sky
Survey (2MASS) and the SPECFIND v2.0. This paper also aims to propose a
possible definition of the optimal Galactic coordinate system by adopting the
ICRS position of the Sgr A* at the Galactic center. The near-infrared 2MASS
point source catalog and the SPECFIND v2.0 catalog of radio continuum spectra
are used to determine the mean position of the Galactic plane on the celestial
sphere. By fitting the data to an ideal Galactic equator, the parameters
defining the Galactic coordinate system are obtained. We find that the
obliquity of the Galactic equator on the ICRS principal plane is about
$0.4^\circ$ (2MASS) and $0.6^\circ$ (SPECFIND v2.0) larger than the J2000.0
value, which is widely used in coordinate transformations between the
equatorial $(\alpha, \delta)$ and the Galactic $(\ell, b)$. Depending on the
adopted parameters, data, and methods, the largest difference between the
resulting Galactic coordinate systems is several arcminutes. We derive revised
transformation matrices and parameters describing the orientation of the
Galactic coordinate systems in the ICRS at the 1 milli-arcsecond level to match
the precision of modern observations. For practical applications, we propose
that a revised definition of the Galactic coordinate system should be required

simplicial decomposition and regular chain decomposition, for parametric

algorithm has been implemented with Maple 15 and experimented with a number of
benchmarks from the literature. Comparison with the Maple package
RegularChains, which contains an implementation of the algorithm in [4], is

chemical peculiarities, often found together with a structured magnetic field.
The atmospheres of most of those chemically peculiar stars present surface
spots, leading to photometric variability caused by rotational modulation. The
study of the light curves of those stars therefore, permits a precise
measurement of their rotational period, which is important to study stellar
evolution and to plan further detailed observations. We analysed the light
curves of 1028 chemically peculiar stars obtained with the STEREO spacecraft.
We present here the results obtained for the 337 magnetic chemically peculiar
stars in our sample. Thanks to the cadence and stability of the photometry,
STEREO data are perfectly suitable to study variability signals with a
periodicity typical of magnetic chemically peculiar stars. Using a matched
filter algorithm and then two different period searching algorithms, we
compiled a list of 82 magnetic chemically peculiar stars for which we measured
a reliable rotational period; for 48 of them this is the first measurement of
their rotational period. The remaining 255 stars are likely to be constant,
although we cannot exclude the presence of long period variability. In some
cases, the presence of blending or systematic effects prevented us from
detecting any reliable variability and in those cases we classified the star as
constant. For each star we classified as variable, we determined temperature,
luminosity, mass and fractional age, but the limited statistics, biased towards
the shorter periods, prevented us from finding any evolutionary trend of the
rotational period. For a few stars, the comparison between their projected
rotational velocity and equatorial velocity let us believe that their real
rotational period might be longer than that found here and previously obtained.

algorithms by associating the sphere with the torus through a periodic
extension. The fundamental property of any sampling theorem is the number of
samples required to represent a band-limited signal. To represent exactly a
signal on the sphere band-limited at L, all sampling theorems on the sphere
require O(L^2) samples. However, our sampling theorem requires less than half
the number of samples of other equiangular sampling theorems on the sphere and
an asymptotically identical, but smaller, number of samples than the
Gauss-Legendre sampling theorem. The complexity of our algorithms scale as
O(L^3), however, the continual use of fast Fourier transforms reduces the
constant prefactor associated with the asymptotic scaling considerably,
resulting in algorithms that are fast. Furthermore, we do not require any
precomputation and our algorithms apply to both scalar and spin functions on
the sphere without any change in computational complexity or computation time.
We make our implementation of these algorithms available publicly and perform
numerical experiments demonstrating their speed and accuracy up to very high
band-limits. Finally, we highlight the advantages of our sampling theorem in
the context of potential applications, notably in the field of compressive
sampling.

correlated organic compound $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2. First, we derive an
effective two-dimensional low-energy model from first principles, having
short-ranged transfers and short-ranged Coulomb and exchange interactions.
Then, we perform many-variable variational Monte Carlo calculations for this
model and draw a ground-state phase diagram as functions of scaling parameters
for the onsite and off-site interactions. The phase diagram consists of three
phases; a paramagnetic metallic phase, an antiferromagnetic (Mott) insulating
phase, and a charge-ordered insulating phase. In the phase diagram, the
parameters for the real compound are close to the first-order Mott transition,
being consistent with experiments. We show that the off-site Coulomb and
exchange interactions affect the phase boundary; (i) they appreciably stabilize
the metallic state against the Mott insulating phase and (ii) enhance charge
fluctuations in a wide parameter region in the metallic phase.
  We observe arc-like structure in Fermi surface around the region where the
charge fluctuations are enhanced. Possible relevance of the charge fluctuations
to the experimentally observed dielectric anomaly in the $\kappa$-BEDT-TTF
family compounds is also pointed out.

foundations of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics, based on the additive
entropy $S_{BG}=- k_B\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$. Its optimization under
appropriate constraints yields the celebrated BG weight $e^{-\beta E_i}$. An
elementary large-deviation connection is provided by $N$ independent binary
variables, which, in the $N\to\infty$ limit yields a Gaussian distribution. The
probability of having $n \ne N/2$ out of $N$ throws is governed by the
exponential decay $e^{-N r}$, where the rate function $r$ is directly related
to the relative BG entropy. To deal with a wide class of complex systems,
nonextensive statistical mechanics has been proposed, based on the nonadditive
entropy $S_q=k_B\frac{1- \sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$ ($q \in {\cal R};
\,S_1=S_{BG}$). Its optimization yields the generalized weight $e_q^{-\beta_q
E_i}$ ($e_q^z \equiv [1+(1-q)z]^{1/(1-q)};\,e_1^z=e^z)$. We numerically study
large deviations for a strongly correlated model which depends on the indices
$Q \in [1,2)$ and $\gamma \in (0,1)$. This model provides, in the $N\to\infty$
limit ($\forall \gamma$), $Q$-Gaussian distributions, ubiquitously observed in
nature ($Q\to 1$ recovers the independent binary model). We show that its
corresponding large deviations are governed by $e_q^{-N r_q}$ ($\propto
1/N^{1/(q-1)}$ if $q>1$) where $q= \frac{Q-1}{\gamma (3-Q)}+1 \ge 1$. This
$q$-generalized illustration opens wide the door towards a desirable

a feeble enhancement in the p-mode oscillations (2-5 mHz) during the flare. On
the other hand, the wavelet analysis of GOLF velocity data and the full-disk

of high energy photons in GRB outflows is also appropriate to study many other
consequences of gamma-gamma annihilation in GRBs: (i) the gamma-gamma cutoff
transition in a time-integrated spectrum is expected to be closer to a
power-law steepening of the spectrum than to a sharp exponential decay; (ii)
the temporal evolution of the gamma-gamma opacity during a burst favors a delay

start from a generic construction and to make discrete modifications of it

such discrete 'twists' constrains the moduli to the corresponding subset of
their moduli space: the twisted bundle has less parametric freedom. We give an

through the disc more rapidly than they contract could be tidally disrupted
when they fill their Roche lobes ~ 0.1 AU away from their parent protostars.
Here we consider the process of mass and angular momentum exchange between the
tidally disrupted planet and the surrounding disc in detail. We find that the
planet's adiabatic mass-radius relation and its ability to open a deep gap in
the disc determine whether the disruption proceeds as a sudden runaway or a
balanced quasi-static process. In the latter case the planet feeds the inner
disc through its Lagrangian L1 point like a secondary star in a stellar binary
system. As the planet loses mass it gains specific angular momentum and
normally migrates in the outward direction until the gap closes. Numerical
experiments show that planet disruption outbursts are preceded by long
""quiescent"" periods during which the disc inward of the planet is empty. The
hole in the disc is created when the planet opens a deep gap, letting the inner
disc to drain onto the star while keeping the outer one stalled behind the
planet. We find that the mass-losing planet embedded in a realistic
protoplanetary disc spawns an extremely rich set of variability patterns. In a
subset of parameter space, there is a limit cycle behaviour caused by
non-linear interaction between the planet mass loss and the disc hydrogen
ionisation instability. We suggest that tidal disruptions of young massive
planets near their stars may be responsible for the observed variability of
young accreting protostars such as FU Ori, EXor and T Tauri stars in general.

and clusters of galaxies as a function of dark matter halo mass. We use
morphological classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project matched to halo
masses from both the C4 cluster catalogue and the Yang et al (2007) group
catalogue. We find that the fraction of early-type (or spiral) galaxies remains
constant (changing by less than 10%) over three orders of magnitude in halo
mass (13<log MH/Msol/h<15.8). This result is insensitive to our choice of halo
mass measure, from velocity dispersions or summed optical luminosity.
Furthermore, we consider the morphology-halo mass relations in bins of galaxy
stellar mass M*, and find that while the trend of constant fraction remains
unchanged, the early-type fraction amongst the most massive galaxies (11<log
M*/Msol/h <12) is a factor of three greater than lower mass galaxies
(10<logM*/Msol/h<10.7). We compare our observational results with those of
simulations presented in De Lucia et al (2011), as well as previous
observational analyses, and semi-analytic bulge (or disc) dominated galaxies
from the Millennium Simulation. We find the simulations recover similar trends
as observed, but may over-predict the abundances of the most massive bulge
dominated (early-type) galaxies. Our results suggest that most morphological
transformation is happening on the group scale before groups merge into massive
clusters. However, we show that within each halo a morphology-density relation
remains: it is summing the total fraction to a self-similar scaled radius which
results in a flat morphology-halo mass relationship.

short to allow practical computation. A promising method to increase the life
time, known as dynamical decoupling, consists of applying a periodic series of
inversion pulses to the quantum bits. In the present review, we give an
overview of this technique and compare different pulse sequences proposed
earlier. We show that pulse imperfections, which are always present in
experimental implementations, limit the performance of dynamical decoupling.
The loss of coherence due to the accumulation of pulse errors can even exceed
the perturbation from the environment. This effect can be largely eliminated by
a judicious design of pulses and sequences. The corresponding sequences are
largely immune to pulse imperfections and provide an increase of the coherence
time of the system by several orders of magnitude.

approach to the periodic Anderson model (PAM) in an applied magnetic field and
in the strong correlation limit. The finite-U corrections are included
systematically by transforming PAM into the form with Kondo-type interaction
and residual hybridization, appearing both at the same time. This effective
Hamiltonian represents the essence of \textit{Anderson-Kondo lattice model}. We
show that in ferromagnetic phases the low-energy single-particle states are
strongly affected by the presence of the applied magnetic field. We also find
that for large values of hybridization strength the system enters the so-called
\textit{locked heavy fermion state}. In this state the chemical potential lies
in the majority-spin hybridization gap and as a consequence, the system
evolution is insensitive to further increase of the applied field. However, for
a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the system transforms from the locked
state to the fully spin-polarized phase. This is accompanied by a metamagnetic
transition, as well as by drastic reduction of the effective mass of
quasiparticles. In particular, we observe a reduction of effective mass
enhancement in the majority-spin subband by as much as 20% in the fully
polarized state. The findings are consistent with experimental results for
Ce$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$ compounds. The mass enhancement for the spin-minority
electrons may also diminish with the increasing field, unlike for the
quasiparticles states in a single narrow band in the same limit of strong

he was a Viennese-born USA-American physicist-chemist, partially associated

California in Berkeley. As a lone small boy, he had arrived (from Austria via
Hamburg) at New York in 1896, but was officially USA-naturalized only in 1912.
He was able to pick up English in the streets of New York and Philadelphia,
when occasionally working as a waiter and/or as a tailor - just to somehow
survive. But, nonetheless, he could successfully graduate a high school in
about one year - and then went to the universities for his further education.
After obtaining his BS from the University of Pennsylvania, he could manage
getting both MA and then PhD from the Yale University, Kent Chemical
Laboratory. George Augustus Linhart was afterwards definitely able to
successfully work out the true foundations of thermodynamics and could thus
outdistance many famous thermodynamicists of his time and even the later ones.
Linhart's view of the Second Law of Thermodynamics was and is extremely
fruitful. The interconnection of Linhart's ideas with those of Gilbert Newton
Lewis, as well as with the modern standpoints are discussed here in detail.

supercell with a certain set of atomic distribution correlation functions. The
Green's function for each atom in the supercell is obtained by embedding the
cluster of neighboring atoms lying within a local interaction zone (LIZ) into
an effective medium and solving the cluster Dyson equation exactly. The key
ingredients of the method are locality, which makes it linearly scaling with
the number of atoms in the supercell, and coherent-potential self-consistency
of the effective medium, which results in a fast convergence of the electronic
structure with respect to the LIZ size. To test the performance and accuracy of
the method, we apply it to two systems: Fe-rich bcc-FeCr random alloy with and
without a short-range order, and a Cr-impurity on the Fe surface. Both cases
demonstrate the importance of taking into account the local environment effects

over cylindric skew tableaux: fixing two integers n>2 and k>0 we shift an
ordinary skew diagram of two partitions, viewed as a subset of the
two-dimensional integer lattice, by the period vector (n,-k). Imposing a
periodicity condition one defines cylindric skew tableaux as a map from the
periodically continued skew diagram into the integers. The resulting cylindric
Macdonald functions appear in the coproduct of a commutative Frobenius algebra,
which is a particular quotient of the spherical Hecke algebra. We realise this
Frobenius algebra as a commutative subalgebra in the endomorphisms over a
Kirillov-Reshetikhin module of the quantum affine sl(n) algebra. Acting with
special elements of this subalgebra, which are noncommutative analogues of
Macdonald polynomials, on a highest weight vector, one obtains Lusztig's
canonical basis. In the limit q=0, one recovers the sl(n) Verlinde algebra,
i.e. the structure constants of the Frobenius algebra become the WZNW fusion
coefficients which are known to be dimensions of moduli spaces of generalized
theta-functions and multiplicities of tilting modules of quantum groups at
roots of unity. Further motivation comes from exactly solvable lattice models
in statistical mechanics: the cylindric Macdonald functions arise as partition
functions of so-called vertex models obtained from solutions to the quantum
Yang-Baxter equation. We show this by stating explicit bijections between
cylindric tableaux and lattice configurations of non-intersecting paths. Using
the algebraic Bethe ansatz the idempotents of the Frobenius algebra are
computed.

universal function of the chemical potentials of the layers $\mu_{1(2)}$
measured in the units of temperature $T$. When both layers are tuned close to
the Dirac point, then the drag coefficient is proportional to the product of
the chemical potentials $\rho_D\propto\mu_1\mu_2$. In the opposite limit of low
temperature the drag is inversely proportional to both chemical potentials
$\rho_D\propto T^2/(\mu_1\mu_2)$. In the mixed case where the chemical
potentials of the two layers belong to the opposite limits $\mu_1\ll T\ll\mu_2$
we find $\rho_D\propto \mu_1/\mu_2$. For stronger interaction and larger values
of $d$ the drag coefficient acquires logarithmic corrections and can no longer
be described by a power law. Further logarithmic corrections are due to the
energy dependence of the impurity scattering time in graphene (for
$\mu_{1(2)}\gg T$ these are small and may be neglected). In the case of
strongly doped (or gated) graphene $\mu_{1(2)}\gg v/d\gg T$ the drag
coefficient acquires additional dependence on the inter-layer spacing and we
recover the usual Fermi-liquid result if the screening length is smaller than

Fermi LAT sources with a hard \gamma-ray spectrum. Here we discuss the
discovery of very high energy gamma-ray (VHE, E > 100 GeV) emission from the
Fermi LAT sources 1FGL J2001.1+4351 and B3-2247+381 with MAGIC. 1FGL
J2001.1+4351, recently identified as MG4 J200112+4352 (Bassani et al. 2010), is
most likely a high peaked BL Lacertae object. The red shift of this source is
still unknown, though the identification of the optical host galaxy suggests z
< 0.2. MAGIC observations indicate short term variability, since the source
showed a strong emission of 20% of the Crab Nebula flux above 90 GeV during the
16th of July 2010 and none of the other observation nights yielded a detection.
B3-2247+381 is classified as a BL Lac object at z = 0.1187 (Veron-Cetty & Veron
catalogue of known AGN). In July 2010 it showed increased optical activity in
the Tuorla blazar monitoring program, which subsequently activated target of
opportunity observations by MAGIC. Within 18 hours of observation time extended
over 13 days between September and October 2010, a strong signal was found
above an energy threshold of 150 GeV. The flux (4% of the Crab Nebula) is
consistent with being constant over the entire observation campaign. We compute
the light curves, model the spectral energy distributions of these new very
high energy gamma-ray emitters and discuss the physical properties of the VHE
gamma-ray emission region.

consumers located in a social network. The payoffs to the firms are the
eventual number of adoptions of their product through a competitive stochastic
diffusion process in the network. This framework yields a rich class of
competitive strategies, which depend in subtle ways on the stochastic dynamics
of adoption, the relative budgets of the players, and the underlying structure
of the social network.
  We identify a general property of the adoption dynamics --- namely,
decreasing returns to local adoption --- for which the inefficiency of resource
use at equilibrium (the Price of Anarchy) is uniformly bounded above, across
all networks. We also show that if this property is violated the Price of
Anarchy can be unbounded, thus yielding sharp threshold behavior for a broad
class of dynamics.
  We also introduce a new notion, the Budget Multiplier, that measures the
extent that imbalances in player budgets can be amplified at equilibrium. We
again identify a general property of the adoption dynamics --- namely,
proportional local adoption between competitors --- for which the (pure
strategy) Budget Multiplier is uniformly bounded above, across all networks. We
show that a violation of this property can lead to unbounded Budget Multiplier,

efficiently inspect the structure of two-point driven quantum phase transitions

two point quantum correlations different from the entanglement. The study of
the ground state properties allows to show that for a whole class of
