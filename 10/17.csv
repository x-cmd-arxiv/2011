increasing temperature a system experiences a chiral phase transition and then
a first-order phase transition of partial scale symmetry restoration

the calculations in the evaluation of MIN. Moreover, for an arbitrary $m\times

submitted, Q3 data were released, so we repeated the analysis with the newly
available light curve. The results of the two quarters were quite similar. From
the amplitude of the beaming modulation we derived a mass of 10 +/- 2 M_Jup for
the secondary, suggesting that KOI-13.01 was a massive planet, with one of the
largest known radii. We also found in the data a periodicity of unknown origin
with a period of 1.0595 d and a peak-to-peak modulation of ~60 ppm. The light
curve of Q3 revealed a few more small-amplitude periodicities with similar

deeper than the reflection peak-to-peak modulation by 16.8 +/- 4.5 ppm. If
real, this small difference was a measure of the thermal emission from the

Degeneracies in our geometric interpretation also allow a retrograde spin-orbit
angle of $124 \pm 4$ degrees. This is the first spin-orbit measurement to come
from gravity darkening, and is one of only a few measurements of the full (not
just the sky-projected) spin-orbit misalignment of an extrasolar planet. We
also measure accurate transit parameters incorporating stellar oblateness and
gravity darkening: $R_* = 1.756 \pm 0.014 R_\odot$, $R_p = 1.445 \pm 0.016

spin-orbit misalignment; planet-planet scattering and stellar spin migration
remain viable mechanisms. Future Kepler data will improve the precision of the

the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the inner part of galaxies
has been established on quite solid grounds. A possible correlation between the
mass of SMBHs and the evolutionary state of their host galaxies is expected.
Based on the recent 2D decomposition of mid-infrared Spiter/IRAC images of
local galaxies with M_bh measurements, we investigated various scaling laws,
studying what the best predictor of the mass of the central SMBHs is. We
focused on the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 law, the relation between the mass of SMBHs and
the kinetic energy of random motions of the corresponding host galaxies. In
order to find the best fit for each of the scaling laws examined, we performed
a least-squares regression of M_bh on x for the considered sample of galaxies,
x being a whatever known parameter of the galaxy bulge. Our analysis shows that
M_bh-M_G sigma^2 law fits the examined experimental data successfully as much
as the other known scaling laws and shows a value of chi^2 better than the
others, a result which is consistent with previous determinations. This means
that a combination of sigma and M_G could be necessary to drive the
correlations between M_bh and other bulge properties. This issue has been
investigated by a careful analysis of the residuals of the various relations.
In order to avoid rushed conclusions on galaxy activity and evolution, the
indirect inferring of M_bh from the kinetic energy of random motions should be
considered, especially when applied to higher redshift galaxies. This statement
is suggested by a reanalysis of the SDSS data used to study the SMBH growth in
the nearby Universe. Adopting the M_bh-M_G sigma^2 relation instead of the
M_bh-sigma, a radio-quiet/radio-loud dichotomy appears in the SMBH mass
distribution of the corresponding SDSS early-type AGN galaxies.

intrinsic thermoelectric (TE) parameters of materials from the ballistic to the
diffusive transport regime. This method relies on the calculation of the number
of propagating modes and the scattering rate for each mode. The modes are
calculated from the energy dispersion (E(k)) of the materials which require
heavy computation and often supply energy relation on sparse momentum (k)
grids. Here an efficient method to calculate the distribution of modes (DOM)
from a given E(k) relationship is presented. The main features of this
algorithm are, (i) its ability to work on sparse dispersion data, and (ii)
creation of an energy grid for the DOM that is almost independent of the
dispersion data therefore allowing for efficient and fast calculation of TE
parameters. The inclusion of scattering effects is also straight forward. The
effect of k-grid sparsity on the compute time for DOM and on the sensitivity of
the calculated TE results are provided. The algorithm calculates the TE
parameters within 5% accuracy when the K-grid sparsity is increased up to 60%
for all the dimensions (3D, 2D and 1D). The time taken for the DOM calculation
is strongly influenced by the transverse K density (K perpendicular to
transport direction) but is almost independent of the transport K density
(along the transport direction). The DOM and TE results from the algorithm are
bench-marked with, (i) analytical calculations for parabolic bands, and (ii)
realistic electronic and phonon results for $Bi_{2}Te_{3}$.

low-rankness and to finite rate of innovation. However, there are important
abstract questions that are yet to be answered. For instance, what are the
general abstract meanings of 'structure' and 'simplicity'? Do there exist
universal algorithms for recovering such simple structured objects from fewer
samples than their ambient dimension? In this paper, we aim to address these
two questions. Using algorithmic information theory tools such as Kolmogorov
complexity, we provide a unified method of describing 'simplicity' and
'structure'. We then explore the performance of an algorithm motivated by
Ocam's Razor (called MCP for minimum complexity pursuit) and show that it
requires $O(k\log n)$ number of samples to recover a signal, where $k$ and $n$
represent its complexity and ambient dimension, respectively. Finally, we
discuss more general classes of signals and provide guarantees on the
performance of MCP.

HESS J1614-518. Analyzing the XMM-Newton archival data, we revealed that Suzaku
J1614-5152 consists of multiple point sources. The X-ray spectrum of the
brightest point source, XMMU J161406.0-515225, can be described by a power-law

with temperature kT = 0.38^{+0.04}_{-0.04} keV. In the blackbody model, the
hydrogen-equivalent column density is almost the same as that of the hard

to numerous ""information piece-workers"", have emerged as an effective paradigm
for human-powered solving of large scale problems in domains such as image
classification, data entry, optical character recognition, recommendation, and
proofreading. Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all such
systems must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically
by assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in an
appropriate manner, e.g. majority voting.
  In this paper, we consider a general model of such crowdsourcing tasks and
pose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task
assignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give
a new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for
inferring correct answers from the workers' answers. We show that our
algorithm, inspired by belief propagation and low-rank matrix approximation,
significantly outperforms majority voting and, in fact, is optimal through
comparison to an oracle that knows the reliability of every worker. Further, we
compare our approach with a more general class of algorithms which can
dynamically assign tasks. By adaptively deciding which questions to ask to the
next arriving worker, one might hope to reduce uncertainty more efficiently. We
show that, perhaps surprisingly, the minimum price necessary to achieve a
target reliability scales in the same manner under both adaptive and
non-adaptive scenarios. Hence, our non-adaptive approach is order-optimal under
both scenarios. This strongly relies on the fact that workers are fleeting and
can not be exploited. Therefore, architecturally, our results suggest that
building a reliable worker-reputation system is essential to fully harnessing
the potential of adaptive designs.

Asymptotic information bounds for such estimators can be obtained from an

communication is accomplished by the exchange of data among IP cores. Often,
the structure of particular messages is not adequate for the communication
purposes. This leads to the concept of packet switching. In the context of
NoCs, packets are composed by header, payload, and trailer. Packets are divided
into small pieces called Flits. It appears of importance, to meet the required
performance in NoC hardware resources. It should be specified in an earlier
step of the system design. The main attention should be given to the choice of
some network parameters such as the physical buffer size in the node. The EED
and packet loss are some of the critical QoS metrics. Some real-time and
multimedia applications bound up these parameters and require specific hardware
resources and particular management approaches in the NoC switch. A traffic
contract (SLA, Service Level Agreement) specifies the ability of a network or

of a neutrino beam between the CERN and the Gran Sasso Laboratory has been

light in vacuum of 60.7 ns was measured, with a quite high confidence level.
Alternatively, one can conclude that the neutrinos travelled 18.2 m more than

on closed time-like curves (CTCs). However, such models typically assume
point-like particles with only two degrees of freedom - a very questionable
assumption given the relativistic setting of the problem. We show that it is
possible to generalise the Deutsch model of CTCs to fields using the equivalent
circuit formalism. We give examples for coherent, squeezed and single-photon
states interacting with the CTC via a beamsplitter. The model is then
generalised further to account for the smooth transition to normal quantum
mechanics as the CTC becomes much smaller than the size of the modes
interacting on it. In this limit, we find that the system behaves like a
standard quantum mechanical feedback loop.

opportunity to examine relative dispersion on a wide range of scales. Adopting
a dynamical systems approach, we focus our attention on scale-dependent
indicators, like the finite-scale Lyapunov exponent (FSLE) and the finite-scale

find that, dependently on the given observable, the quasigeostrophic turbulence
scenario is overall compatible with our data analysis, with discrepancies from
the expected behavior of 2D turbulent trajectories likely to be ascribed to the
non stationary and non homogeneous characteristics of the flow, as well as to
possible ageostrophic effects. Submesoscale features of O(1) km are considered
to play a role, to some extent, in determining the properties of relative

algorithmic information or Kolmogorov complexity, takes events as strings and,

information, takes events as belonging to ensembles and quantifies the
information resulting from observing the given event in terms of the number of

future data that learning algorithms embed into classifiers.
  This note describes a new method of quantifying information, effective
information, that links algorithmic information to Shannon information, and
also links both to capacities arising in statistical learning theory. After
introducing the measure, we show that it provides a non-universal analog of
Kolmogorov complexity. We then apply it to derive basic capacities in

complexity. A nice byproduct of our approach is an interpretation of the
explanatory power of a learning algorithm in terms of the number of hypotheses

their primordial origin remains a major puzzle. The production of large
molecules, as we know it today, requires good catalysts, and the only good
catalysts we know that can accomplish this task consist of large molecules.
Thus the origin of large molecules is a chicken and egg problem in chemistry.
Here we present a mechanism, based on autocatalytic sets (ACSs), that is a
possible solution to this problem. We discuss a mathematical model describing
the population dynamics of molecules in a stylized but prebiotically plausible
chemistry. Large molecules can be produced in this chemistry by the coalescing
of smaller ones, with the smallest molecules, the `food set', being buffered.
Some of the reactions can be catalyzed by molecules within the chemistry with
varying catalytic strengths. Normally the concentrations of large molecules in
such a scenario are very small, diminishing exponentially with their size.
ACSs, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the resources of the
system into a sparse set of molecules. ACSs can produce a bistability in the
population dynamics and, in particular, steady states wherein the ACS molecules
dominate the population. However to reach these steady states from initial
conditions that contain only the food set typically requires very large
catalytic strengths, growing exponentially with the size of the catalyst
molecule. We present a solution to this problem by studying `nested ACSs', a
structure in which a small ACS is connected to a larger one and reinforces it.
We show that when the network contains a cascade of nested ACSs with the
catalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with their size (e.g., as
a power law), a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules
can come to dominate the system.

by non-uniform probability distributions on the multidimensional sphere. These
random motions differ from similar models appeared in literature which take
directions according to the uniform law. The family of angular probability
distributions introduced in this paper depends on a parameter $\nu\geq 0$ which
gives the level of drift of the motion. Furthermore, we assume that the number
of changes of direction performed by the random flight is fixed. The time
lengths between two consecutive changes of orientation have joint probability
distribution given by a Dirichlet density function.
  The analysis of $\underline{\bf X}_d(t),t>0,$ is not an easy task, because it
involves the calculation of integrals which are not always solvable. Therefore,
we analyze the random flight $\underline{\bf X}_m^d(t),t>0,$ obtained as
projection onto the lower spaces $\mathbb{R}^m,m<d,$ of the original random
motion in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Then we get the probability distribution of
$\underline{\bf X}_m^d(t),t>0.$
  Although, in its general framework, the analysis of $\underline{\bf
X}_d(t),t>0,$ is very complicated, for some values of $\nu$, we can provide
some results on the process. Indeed, for $\nu=1$, we obtain the characteristic
function of the random flight moving in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, by
inverting the characteristic function, we are able to give the analytic form
(up to some constants) of the probability distribution of $\underline{\bf

a symmetry which has been broken in a very specific manner, involving ladder

a term linear in the supercharges is discussed as a motivating example. The

theory is the inverse dimensionless frequency $1/\sigma$. Our mathematical
approach combines the two-timing method, distinguished limits, and the use of
commutators to simplify calculations. This approach produces recurrent
equations for both the averaged and oscillating parts of unknown fields. We do
not use any physical or mathematical assumptions (except the most common ones)

successive approximations. In all our examples the averaged equations exhibit
the universal structure: the Reynolds-stress-type terms (or the
cross-correlations) are transformed into drift velocities, pseudo-diffusion,
and two other terms reminiscent of Moffatt's mean-fields in turbulence. In
particular, the averaged motion of a passive scalar admixture is described only
by a drift and pseudo-diffusion. The averaged equations for a passive vectorial
admixture and for vortex dynamics possess two mean-field terms, additional to
pseudo-diffusion. It is remarkable that all mean-field terms (including
pseudo-diffusion) are expressed by invariant operators (Lie-derivatives) which
measure the deviation of some tensors from their `frozen-in' values. Some
physical assumptions and the results can be build upon obtained averaged
equations. Our physical interpretation suggests purely kinematic nature of
pseudo-diffusion.

systems have formed from that process in the trans-neptunian belt. We show that
Haumea is a potential example of an object that has suffered a rotational
fission. Its current fast spin would be a slight evolution of a primordial fast
spin, rather than the result of a catastrophic collision, because the
percentage of objects rotating faster than 4 hours would not be small in a
maxwellian distribution of spin rates that fits the current TNO rotation
database. On the other hand, the specific total angular momentum of Haumea and
its satellites falls close to that of the high size ratio asteroid binaries,
which are thought to be the result of rotational fissions or mass shedding. We
also present N-body simulations of rotational fissions applied to the case of
Haumea, which show that this process is feasible, might have generated
satellites, and might have even created a ""family"" of bodies orbitally
associated to Haumea. The orbitally associated bodies may come from the direct
ejection of fragments according to our simulations, or through the evolution of
a proto-satellite formed during the fission event. Also, the disruption of an
escaped fragment after the fission might create the orbitally related bodies.
If any of those mechanisms are correct, other rotational fission families may
be detectable in the trans-neptunian belt in the future, and perhaps even TNO
pairs might be found (pairs of bodies sharing very similar orbital elements,
but not bound together).

graph together with vertex and edge weights. When these weights are considered
indeterminates, the partition function for the constant case is a trivariate
polynomial Z(G;x,y,z). This polynomial was studied with respect to its
approximability by L. A. Goldberg, M. Jerrum and M. Paterson in 2003.
Z(G;x,y,z) generalizes a bivariate polynomial Z(G;t,y), which was studied by D.

  We consider the complexity of Z(G;t,y) and Z(G;x,y,z) in comparison to that
of the Tutte polynomial, which is well-known to be closely related to the Potts
model in the absence of an external field. We show that Z(G;\x,\y,\z) is

#ETH, was introduced by H. Dell, T. Husfeldt and M. Wahl\'{e}n in 2010 in order
to study the complexity of the Tutte polynomial. In analogy to their results,
we give a dichotomy theorem stating that evaluations of Z(G;t,y) either take
exponential time in the number of vertices of $G$ to compute, or can be done in
polynomial time. Finally, we give an algorithm for computing Z(G;x,y,z) in

temperature range, where the thermal instability criterion for isochoric

models: statistical particle-in-a-box codes to study their collisional and size
distribution evolution, and dynamical N-body models to study their spatial
structure. The absence of collisions from N-body codes is in particular a major
shortcoming, as collisional processes are expected to significantly alter the
results obtained from pure N-body runs. We present a new numerical model, to
study the spatial structure of perturbed debris discs at dynamical and
collisional steady-state. We focus on the competing effects between
gravitational perturbations by a massive body (planet or star), collisional
production of small grains, and radiation pressure placing these grains in
possibly dynamically unstable regions. We consider a disc of parent bodies at
dynamical steady-state, from which small radiation-pressure-affected grains are
released in a series of runs, each corresponding to a different orbital
position of the perturber, where particles are assigned a collisional
destruction probability. These collisional runs produce successive position
maps that are then recombined, following a complex procedure, to produce
surface density profiles for each orbital position of the perturbing body. We
apply our code to the case of a circumprimary disc in a binary. We find
pronounced structures inside and outside the dynamical stability regions. For
low $e_B$, the disc's structure is time varying, with spiral arms in the
dynamically ""forbidden"" region precessing with the companion star. For high
$e_B$, the disc is strongly asymmetric but time invariant, with a pronounced
density drop in the binary's periastron direction. (better resolution version

CAR is highly sensitive to electron spins and yields a rich variety of
properties of non-local conductance which we describe non-perturbatively at
arbitrary voltages, temperature, degree of disorder, spin-dependent interface
transmissions and their polarizations. We demonstrate that magnetic effects
have different implications: While strong exchange field suppresses
disorder-induced electron interference in ferromagnetic electrodes,
spin-sensitive electron scattering at SF interfaces can drive the total
non-local conductance negative at sufficiently low energies. At higher energies
magnetic effects become less important and the non-local resistance behaves
similarly to the non-magnetic case. Our results can be applied to
multi-terminal hybrid structures with normal, ferromagnetic and half-metallic

electronic, and optical properties of materials, relating to each other by the
material's elasticity or stiffness. Both are represented by second rank field
tensors with, in general, six independent components. Measurements of these
quantities are usually achieved by measuring a property that depends on the
translational symmetry and periodicity of the crystal lattice, such as optical
phonon energies using Raman spectroscopy, the electronic band gap using
cathodoluminescence, photoelasticity via the optical birefringence, or Electron
Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD). A reciprocal relationship therefore exists
between the maximum sensitivity of the measurements and the spatial resolution.
Furthermore, of these techniques, only EBSD and off-axis Raman spectroscopy
allow measurement of all six components of the stress tensor, but neither is
able to provide full 3D maps. Here we demonstrate a method for measuring the
full stress tensor in diamond, using the spectral and optical polarization
properties of the photoluminescence from individual nitrogen vacancy (NV)
colour centres. We demonstrate a sensitivity of order 10 MPa, limited by local
fluctuations in the stress in the sample, and corresponding to a strain of
about 10^-5, comparable with the best sensitivity provided by other techniques.
By using the colour centres as built-in local sensors, the technique overcomes
the reciprocal relationship between spatial resolution and sensitivity and
offers the potential for measuring strains as small as 10^-9 at spatial
resolution of order 10 nm. Furthermore it provides a straightforward route to
volumetric stress mapping. Aside from its value in understanding strain
distributions in diamond, this new approach to stress and strain measurement
could be adapted for use in micro or nanoscale sensors.

studied in both the hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes. The anisotropy and
long range effects of the dipolar force as well as the role of the trapping
geometry are explicitly investigated. In the hydrodynamic regime the frequency
is always slightly smaller than the $\sqrt{2}\omega_\perp$ value holding for
gases interacting with contact interactions. In the collisionless regime the
frequency can be either pretty smaller or larger than the non-interacting value
$2\omega_\perp$, depending on the cloud aspect ratio. Our results suggest that
the frequency of the surface quadrupole oscillation can provide a useful test
for studying, at very low temperatures, the transition between the normal and
the superfluid phase and, in the normal phase at higher temperatures, the
crossover between the collisional and collisionless regimes. The consequences
of the anisotropy of the dipolar force on the virial theorem are also
discussed.

external noise sources. Specifically we consider a resistively shunted
Josephson junction and a one dimensional quantum liquid in a commensurate
lattice potential, subject to $1/f$ noise. In absence of nonlinear coupling, we
have shown previously that these systems establish a non-equilibrium critical
steady state [Nature Phys. 6, 806 (2010)]. Here we use this state as the basis
for a controlled renormalization group analysis using the Keldysh path integral
formulation to treat the non linearities: the Josephson coupling and the
commensurate lattice.
  The analysis to first order in the coupling constant indicates transitions
between superconducting and localized regimes that are smoothly connected to
the respective equilibrium transitions. However at second order, the back
action of the mode coupling on the critical state leads to renormalization of
dissipation and emergence of an effective temperature. In the Josephson
junction the temperature is parametrically small allowing to observe a
universal crossover between the superconducting and insulating regimes. The IV
characteristics of the junction displays algebraic behavior controlled by the
underlying critical state over a wide range. In the noisy one dimensional
liquid the generated dissipation and effective temperature are not small as in
the junction. We find a crossover between a quasi-localized regime dominated by
dissipation and another dominated by temperature. However since in the thermal
regime the thermalization rate is parametrically small, signatures of the
non-equilibrium critical state can be seen in transient dynamics.

using the (conserving) Hartree-Fock approximation, which treats direct and
exchange interactions on an equal footing, we obtain the spectrum of
single-particle excitations and long wavelength collective modes (zero sound)
in the normal phase. It appears that exchange interactions result in strong
damping of zero sound when the tilting angle between the dipoles and the normal
to the plane of confinement is below some critical value. In particular, zero
sound cannot propagate if the dipoles are perpendicular to the plane of
confinement. At intermediate coupling we find unstable modes that can lead
either to collapse of the system or the formation of a density wave. The BCS
transition to a superfluid phase, on the other hand, occurs at arbitrarily weak
strengths of the dipole-dipole interaction, provided the tilting angle exceeds
a critical value. We determine the critical temperature of the transition

Alday-Maldacena approach. The amplitudes in the two approaches are of Regge
type at high-energy and with the same logarithmic Regge trajectory
independently of the kind of colliding particles, in agreement with the
expected universality of Regge trajectories.

Factory setup aimed to explore leptonic CP violation and the neutrino mass
ordering. In this talk, we discuss the baseline and energy optimization of the
Neutrino Factory including the latest simulation results on the magnetized iron
neutrino detector (MIND) in the light of both small and large theta(13). We
find that in case of small theta(13), baselines of about 2500 to 5000 km is the
optimal choice for the CP violation measurement with E(mu) as low as 12 GeV can
be considered. However, for large theta(13), we show that the lower threshold
and the backgrounds reconstructed at lower energies allow in fact for muon
energies as low as 5 to 8 GeV at considerably shorter baselines, such as
Fermilab to Homestake. This suggests that with the latest MIND simulation, low-
and high-energy versions of the Neutrino Factory are just two different forms
of the same experiment optimized for different regions of the parameter space.

because the technipion decay constant is smaller than the weak scale) and also
enhanced branching ratios into di-photon and di-tau final states (largely due
to the suppression of WW decays of the technipions). These factors combine to
make the technipions more visible in both channels than a standard model Higgs

propulsive power of nematodes. The device consists of a tapered conduit filled
with aqueous solution. The conduit is subjected to a DC electric field with the
negative pole at the narrow end and to pressure-driven flow directed from the
narrow end. The nematode is inserted at the conduit's wide end. Directed by the
electric field (through electrotaxis), the nematode swims deliberately upstream
toward the negative pole of the DC field. As the conduit narrows, the average
fluid velocity and the drag force on the nematode increase. Eventually, the
nematode arrives at an equilibrium position, at which its propulsive force
balances the viscous drag force induced by the adverse flow. The equilibrium
position of different animals, with similar body lengths, was measured as a
function of the flow rate. The flow field around the nematode was obtained by
direct numerical simulations with the experimentally imaged gait and the
tapered geometry of the conduit as boundary conditions. The flow field
generated by a swimming worm is similar to the one induced by two pairs of
counter rotating rotors. Equilibrium positions under different flow rates were
identified by finding the positions at which the horizontal component of the
total force exerted on the worm body vanishes. The theoretically predicted
equilibrium positions were compared and favorably agreed with the experimental
data. The nematode's propulsive power was calculated by integrating the product
of velocity and total stress over the worm's body surface. The device is useful
to retain the nematodes at a nearly fixed position for prolonged observations
of active animals under a microscope, to keep the nematode exercising, and to
estimate the nematode's power consumption based on the conduit's width at the
equilibrium position.

rotating magnetized neutron stars is constructed. In this model the accreting
matter subsonically settles down onto the rotating magnetosphere forming an
extended quasi-static shell. This shell mediates the angular momentum removal
from the rotating neutron star magnetosphere during spin-down episodes by
large-scale convective motions. The accretion rate through the shell is
determined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere. The
settling regime of accretion can be realized for moderate accretion rates $\dot
M< \dot M_*\simeq 4\times 10^{16}$ g/s. At higher accretion rates a free-fall
gap above the neutron star magnetosphere appears due to rapid Compton cooling,
and accretion becomes highly non-stationary. From observations of the
spin-up/spin-down rates (the angular rotation frequency derivative $\dot
\omega^*$, and $\partial\dot\omega^*/\partial\dot M$ near the torque reversal)
of X-ray pulsars with known orbital periods, it is possible to determine the
main dimensionless parameters of the model, as well as to estimate the magnetic
field of the neutron star. We illustrate the model by determining these
parameters for three wind-fed X-ray pulsars GX 301-2, Vela X-1, and GX 1+4. The
model explains both the spin-up/spin-down of the pulsar frequency on large
time-scales and the irregular short-term frequency fluctuations, which can
correlate or anti-correlate with the X-ray flux fluctuations in different
systems. It is shown that in real pulsars an almost iso-angular-momentum

Classical Electrodynamics (kind of a self-action ansatz). New, ""better-coupled""
mechanical and wave equations manifest unexpectedly wrong dynamics due to
changes of their coefficients (masses); thus this ansatz fails. I show how we
make a mathematical error with advancing a self-interaction Lagrangian. I show,
however, that renormalization of the fundamental constants in the wrong

The exactly renormalized equations contain only physical fundamental constants,
describe well the experimental data, and reveal a deeper physics - that of
permanently coupled constituents. The perturbation theory is then just a
routine calculation giving small and physical corrections. I demonstrate that
renormalization is just illegitimately discarding harmful corrections
compensating this error, that the exactly renormalized equations may sometimes
accidentally coincide with the correct equations (a fluke), and that the right
theoretical formulation of permanently coupled constituents can be fulfilled
directly, if realized.

an initial state to a target state. The standard solution to this problem
involves computing the zone graph of the automaton, which in principle could be
infinite. In order to make the graph finite, zones are approximated using an
extrapolation operator. For reasons of efficiency in current algorithms
extrapolation of a zone is always a zone and in particular it is convex.
  In this paper, we propose to solve the reachability problem without such
extrapolation operators. To ensure termination, we provide an efficient
algorithm to check if a zone is included in the so called region closure of
another. Although theoretically better, closure cannot be used in the standard
algorithm since a closure of a zone may not be convex.
  An additional benefit of the proposed approach is that it permits to
calculate approximating parameters on-the-fly during exploration of the zone
graph, as opposed to the current methods which do it by a static analysis of
the automaton prior to the exploration. This allows for further improvements in
the algorithm. Promising experimental results are presented.

they are parametrized by the maximal lower and upper bounds (LU-bounds)
occurring in the guards of the automaton. We consider the aLU abstraction
defined by Behrmann et al. Since this abstraction can potentially yield
non-convex sets, it has not been used in implementations. We prove that aLU
abstraction is the biggest abstraction with respect to LU-bounds that is sound

of core concerns of today's nano-technology, which has been resulted by
continuous downscaling of CMOS technologies. The resultant 'device shrinking'
reduces the soft error tolerance of the VLSI circuits, as very little energy is
needed to change their states. Safety critical systems are very sensitive to
soft errors. A bit flip due to soft error can change the value of critical
variable and consequently the system control flow can completely be changed
which leads to system failure. To minimize soft error risks, a novel
methodology is proposed to detect and recover from soft errors considering only
'critical code blocks' and 'critical variables' rather than considering all
variables and/or blocks in the whole program. The proposed method shortens
space and time overhead in comparison to existing dominant approaches.
