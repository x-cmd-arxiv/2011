collisions at the same collision energy in terms of the nuclear modification
factor $R_{AA}$. The high-$p_{T}$ charge particle production in central Pb$-$Pb
collisions ($0-5%$) is strongly suppressed by a factor $\approx6$ at transverse
momenta $p_{T}=6-7$ GeV/c as compared to expectation from independent
superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. Above $p_{T}=7$ GeV/c there is a
significant rise in the nuclear modification factor, which reaches $R_{AA}
\approx 0.4$ at $p_{T}=50$ GeV/c. The measured suppression of high-$p_{T}$
particles is stronger than that measured at RHIC.

produced by elementary charges is revisited using the model of an electron
freely evolving in a photon bath. It is shown that for any finite travel time,
the effective field of the electron is infrared-finite, and that in each order
of perturbation theory the radiative contributions grow without bound in the
large-time limit. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, factorization of
divergent contributions in multi-loop diagrams is proved, and summation of the
resulting infinite series is performed. It is demonstrated that the effective
electromagnetic field of the electron vanishes in the large-time limit, and
that this vanishing respects the total charge conservation and the Gauss law.
It is concluded that the physical meaning of infrared singularity in the
effective field is the existence of a peculiar irreversible spreading of
electric charges, caused by their interaction with the photon field. This
spreading exists in vacuum as well as at finite temperature, and shows itself
in a damping of the off-diagonal elements of the momentum-space density matrix
of electron, but does not affect its momentum probability distribution. It
precludes preparation of spatially localized particle states at finite times by
operating with free particle states in the remote past. Relationship of the
obtained results to the Bloch-Nordsieck theorem is established, and discussed
from the standpoint of measurability of the electromagnetic field. The effect
of irreversible spreading on the electron diffraction in the classic two-slit
experiment is determined, and is shown to be detectable in principle by modern
devices already at room temperature.

the MultiNest package for nested sampling as well as the training of an

computationally expensive likelihoods, this allows the substitution of a much
more rapid approximation in order to increase significantly the speed of the
analysis. We begin by demonstrating, with a few toy examples, the ability of a
NN to learn complicated likelihood surfaces. BAMBI's ability to decrease
running time for Bayesian inference is then demonstrated in the context of
estimating cosmological parameters from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
and other observations. We show that valuable speed increases are achieved in
addition to obtaining NNs trained on the likelihood functions for the different
model and data combinations. These NNs can then be used for an even faster
follow-up analysis using the same likelihood and different priors. This is a
fully general algorithm that can be applied, without any pre-processing, to
other problems with computationally expensive likelihood functions.

persists for 2D fermion systems. In this paper we first consider the
entanglement entropy of a toy model, namely a set of decoupled 1D chains of

use multi-dimensional bosonization to re-derive the formula by Gioev and Klich

effective Hamiltonian, and explicitly show the logarithmic corrections to the
area law in both cases share the same origin: the discontinuity at the Fermi
surface (points). In the presence of Fermi liquid (forward scattering)
interactions, the bosonized theory remains quadratic in terms of the original
local degrees of freedom, and after regularizing the theory with a mass term we
are able to calculate the entanglement entropy perturbatively up to second
order in powers of the coupling parameter for a special geometry via the
replica trick. We show that these interactions do not change the leading
scaling behavior for the entanglement entropy of a Fermi liquid. At higher
orders, we argue that this should remain true through a scaling analysis.

1/5,...$, can be considered in terms of spin wave annihilation/creation
processes. Hyperfine coupling with the nuclei of the GaAs matrix provides spin
non-conservation in the two-dimensional electron gas and determines spin
relaxation in the quantum Hall system. This mechanism competes with spin-orbit
coupling channels of spin-wave decay and can even dominate in a low-temperature
regime where $T$ is much smaller than the Zeeman gap. In this case the
spin-wave relaxation process occurs non-exponentially with time and does not
depend on the temperature. The competition of different relaxation channels
results in crossovers in the dominant mechanism, leading to non-monotonic
behavior of the characteristic relaxation time with the magnetic field. We
predict that the relaxation times should reach maxima at $B\simeq 18\,$T in the
$\nu=1$ Quantum Hall system and at $B\simeq 12\,$T for that of $\nu=1/3\,$. We
estimate these times as $\sim10\,-\,30\,\mu$s and $\sim2\,-\,5\,\mu$s,

embedded in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. Obtaining a good estimation of
where wireless devices are located is crucial in wireless network applications
including environment monitoring, geographic routing and topology control. When
the positions of the devices are unknown and only local distance information is
given, we need to infer the positions from these local distance measurements.
This problem is particularly challenging when we only have access to
measurements that have limited accuracy and are incomplete. We consider the
extreme case of this limitation on the available information, namely only the
connectivity information is available, i.e., we only know whether a pair of
nodes is within a fixed detection range of each other or not, and no
information is known about how far apart they are. Further, to account for
detection failures, we assume that even if a pair of devices is within the
detection range, it fails to detect the presence of one another with some
probability and this probability of failure depends on how far apart those
devices are. Given this limited information, we investigate the performance of
a centralized positioning algorithm MDS-MAP introduced by Shang et al., and a
distributed positioning algorithm, introduced by Savarese et al., called
HOP-TERRAIN. In particular, for a network consisting of n devices positioned
randomly, we provide a bound on the resulting error for both algorithms. We
show that the error is bounded, decreasing at a rate that is proportional to
R/Rc, where Rc is the critical detection range when the resulting random
network starts to be connected, and R is the detection range of each device.

examined here by choosing quantum deficit, proposed by Rajagopal and Rendell,
an operational measure of correlations. In addition to establishing the
polygamous nature of the class of three qubit sym- metric pure states
characterized by two distinct Majorana spinors (to which the W states belong),
those with three distinct Majorana spinors (to which GHZ states belong) are
shown to either obey or violate monogamy relations. While the generalized W
states can be mono/polygamous, the generalized GHZ states exhibit monogamy with
respect to quantum deficit. The issue of us- ing monogamy conditions based on
quantum deficit to witness the states belonging to SLOCC inequivalent classes

transformation properties of the functional with respect to different
symmetries is required, as a step preliminary to the adjustment of the coupling
constants. Purpose: Determine to which extent the presence of higher-order
derivatives in the functional can be compatible with the continuity equation.
In particular, to study the relations between the validity of the continuity
equation and invariance of the functional under gauge transformations. Methods:
Derive conditions for the validity of the continuity equation in the framework
of time-dependent density functional theory. The conditions apply separately to
the four spin-isospin channels of the one-body density matrix. Results: We
obtained four sets of constraints on the coupling constants of the N3LO energy
density functional that guarantee the validity of the continuity equation in
all spin-isospin channels. In particular, for the scalar-isoscalar channel, the
constraints are the same as those resulting from imposing the standard U(1)
local-gauge-invariance conditions. Conclusions: Validity of the continuity
equation in the four spin-isospin channels is equivalent to the local-gauge
invariance of the energy density functional. For vector and isovector channels,
such validity requires the invariance of the functional under local rotations
in the spin and isospin spaces.

(LISA) mission in order to detect GW.
  The need of accurate testing of free-fall and knowledge of noise in a space
environment similar to LISA's is considered mandatory a pre-phase for the
project. Therefore the LISA Pathfinder mission has been designed by ESA to fly
the LISA Technology Package (LTP), aiming at testing free-fall by measuring the
residual acceleration between two test-bodies in the dynamical scheme we
address as ""drag-free"". The spectral map of the residual acceleration as
function of frequency will convey information on the local noise level, thus
producing a picture of the environmental working conditions for LISA itself.
  The thesis contains abundant material on the problem of compensating static
gravity, the development of a theory of orthogonalization of reference and
cross-talk for the LTP experiment. The construction of the laser detection
procedure starting from GR and differential geometry arguments is carried on.
Effort was put in pointing out the physical motivations for the choices made in
several other papers by the author and colleagues. In this perspective the
thesis is meant as a summary tool for the LTP collaboration.
  In the second part of the thesis we summarize our contributions for a
measurement of G onboard LTP and review on possible tests of fundamental
physics the mission might embody.
  A wide part of the thesis is now part of the LTP Operation Master Plan,
describing the real science and operations onboard LISA Pathfinder. This thesis

clustering and bias functions of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, both in real-
and redshift-space. Moreover, we investigate the effects of the dark energy
(DE) coupling on the geometric and dynamic redshift-space distortions,
quantifying the difference with respect to the concordance LambdaCDM model. At
z~0, the spatial properties of CDM haloes in cDE models appear very similar to
the LambdaCDM case, even if the cDE models are normalized at last scattering in
order to be consistent with the latest Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data.
At higher redshifts, we find that the DE coupling produces a significant
scale-dependent suppression of the halo clustering and bias function. This
effect, that strongly depends on the coupling strength, is not degenerate with
sigma8 at scales r<5-10 Mpc/h. Moreover, we find that the coupled DE strongly
affects both the linear distortion parameter, beta, and the pairwise peculiar
velocity dispersion, sigma12. Although the models considered in this work are
found to be all in agreement with presently available observational data, the
next generation of galaxy surveys will be able to put strong constraints on the
level of coupling between DE and CDM exploiting the shape of redshift-space

maps, we explore the variation of the ionized-gas, PAH, and warm-gas (H_2)
properties across the sequence and within the galaxies. While the global PAH
interband strength and ionized gas flux ratios ([Ne III]/[Ne II]) are similar
to those of normal star forming galaxies, the distribution of the spatially
resolved PAH and fine structure line flux ratios is significant different from
one system to the other. Rather than a constant H_2/PAH flux ratio, we find
that the relation between the H_2 and PAH fluxes is characterized by a power
law with a roughly constant exponent (0.61+/-0.05) over all merger components
and spatial scales. While following the same power law on local scales, three
galaxies have a factor of ten larger integrated (i.e. global) H_2/PAH flux
ratio than the rest of the sample, even larger than what it is in most nearby
AGNs. These findings suggest a common dominant excitation mechanism for H_2
emission over a large range of global H_2/PAH flux ratios in major mergers.
Early merger systems show a different distribution between the cold (CO J=1-0)
and warm (H_2) molecular gas component, which is likely due to the merger
interaction. Strong evidence for buried star formation in the overlap region of
the merging galaxies is found in two merger systems (NGC6621 and NGC7592) as
seen in the PAH, [Ne II], [Ne III], and warm gas line emission, but with no
apparent corresponding CO (J=1-0) emission. Our findings also demonstrate that
the variations of the physical conditions within a merger are much larger than
any systematic trends along the Toomre Sequence.

of the solar system volume near the cycle minimum. Removing stray light from
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the Sun's corona is of high astrophysical
importance, as it is required to make meaningful determinations of temperatures
and densities of coronal holes. EUV images tend to be dominated by the
component of the stray light due to the long-range scatter caused by
microroughness of telescope mirror surfaces, and this component has proven very
difficult to measure in pre-flight characterization. In-flight characterization
heretofore has proven elusive due to the fact that the detected image is
simultaneously nonlinear in two unknown functions: the stray light pattern and
the true image which would be seen by an ideal telescope. Using a constrained
blind deconvolution technique that takes advantage of known zeros in the true
image provided by a fortuitous lunar transit, we have removed the stray light
from solar images seen by the EUVI instrument on STEREO-B in all four filter
bands (171, 195, 284, and 304 \AA). Uncertainty measures of the stray light
corrected images, which include the systematic error due to misestimation of
the scatter, are provided. It is shown that in EUVI, stray light contributes up
to 70% of the emission in coronal holes seen on the solar disk, which has
dramatic consequences for diagnostics of temperature and density and therefore
estimates of key plasma parameters such as the plasma $\beta$\ and ion-electron
collision rates.

supplemented with unpolarised spectra from the ESO UVES, UVES-FLAMES, and HARPS
spectrographs of the very peculiar large-field magnetic Ap star HD 318107, a
member of the open cluster NGC 6405. The available data provide sufficient
material with which to re-analyse the first-order model of the magnetic field
geometry and to derive abundances of Si, Ti, Fe, Nd, Pr, Mg, Cr, Mn, O, and Ca.
The magnetic field structure was modelled with a low-order colinear multipole
expansion, using coefficients derived from the observed variations of the field
strength with rotation phase. The abundances of several elements were
determined using spectral synthesis. After experiments with a very simple model
of uniform abundance on each of three rings of equal width in co-latitude and
symmetric about the assumed magnetic axis, we decided to model the spectra
assuming uniform abundances of each element over the stellar surface. The new
magnetic field measurements allow us to refine the rotation period of HD 318107
to P = 9.7088 +/- 0.0007 days. Appropriate magnetic field model parameters were
found that very coarsely describe the (apparently rather complex) field moment
variations. Spectrum synthesis leads to the derivation of mean abundances for
the elements Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Nd, and Pr. All of these elements except
for Mg and Ca are strongly overabundant compared to the solar abundance ratios.
There is considerable evidence of non-uniformity, for example in the different
values of B_z found using lines of different elements. The present data set,
while limited, is nevertheless sufficient to provide a useful first-order
assessment of both the magnetic and surface abundance properties of HD 318107,
making it one of the very few magnetic Ap stars of well-known age for which
both of these properties have been studied.

reflectors that transform a spherical wavefront into a beam of parallel rays

to an infinite dimensional linear programming (LP) problem. We investigate
techniques for constructing the two reflectors numerically. A straightforward
discretization of this problem has the disadvantage that the number of
constraints increases rapidly with the mesh size. So with this technique only
very coarse meshes are practical. To address this well-known issue we propose
an iterative solution scheme. In each step an LP problem is solved. Information
from the previous iteration step is used to reduce the number of constraints
necessary. As a proof of concept we apply our proposed scheme to solve a
problem with synthetic data. We give evidence that the scheme converges. We
also show that it allows for much finer meshes than a simple discretization
scheme. There exists a growing literature for the application of optimal
transportation theory to other beam shaping problems. Our proposed scheme is
easy to adapt for these problems as well.

over several multiple-user phase asynchronous channels. Namely, we consider a
class of phase-incoherent multiple access relay channels (MARC) with both
non-causal and causal unidirectional cooperation between encoders, referred to
as phase-incoherent unidirectional non-causal cooperative MARC (PI-UNCC-MARC),
and phase-incoherent unidirectional causal cooperative MARC (PI-UCC-MARC)
respectively. We also consider phase-incoherent interference channels (PI-IC),
and interference relay channel (PI-IRC) models in the same context. In all
cases, the input signals are assumed to undergo non-ergodic phase shifts due to
the channel. The shifts are assumed to be unknown to the transmitters and known
to the receivers as a realistic assumption. Both necessary and sufficient
conditions in order to reliably send the correlated sources to the destinations
over the considered channels are derived. In particular, for all of the channel
models, we first derive an outer bound for reliable communication that is
defined with respect to the source entropy content (i.e., the triple
$(H(U|V),H(V|U),H(U,V))$). Then, using {\em separate} source and channel
coding, under specific gain conditions, we establish the same region as the
inner bound and therefore obtain tight conditions for reliable communication
for the specific channel under study. We thus establish a source-channel
separation theorem for each channel and conclude that without the knowledge of
the phase shifts at the transmitter sides, separation is optimal. It is further
conjectured that separation in general is optimal for all channel coefficients.

these phases can be classified according to the number of Majorana zero modes
of an open chain: 0, 1, or 2 at each end. The model posseses a multicritical
point where phases with 0, 1, and 2 Majorana end modes meet. The number of
Majorana modes at each end of the chain is identical to the topological winding
number of the Anderson's pseudospin vector that describes the BCS Hamiltonian.
The topological classification of the phases requires a unitary time-reversal
symmetry to be present. When this symmetry is broken, only the number of
Majorana end modes modulo 2 can be used to distinguish two phases. In one of
the regimes, the wave functions of the two phase shifted Majorana zero modes
decays exponentially in space but but in an oscillatory manner. The wavelength
of oscillation is identical to the asymptotic connected spin-spin correlation
of the XY-model in a transverse field to which our model is dual.

X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy and Small Angle X-ray Scattering over a

relatively low concentrations, showing the importance of indirect hydrodynamic
interactions. Hydrodynamic functions were derived from the data and for
moderate particle volume fractions (> 0.40) there is a good agreement with
earlier many-body theory calculations by Beenakker and Mazur [C.W.J. Beenakker

higher concentrations, above ~0.40, where the hydrodynamic effects are

polytope $P$. The possible non-degenerate pivot operations of the simplex
method in solving a linear program over $P$ can be represented as a special
polytopal digraph known as an LP digraph. Presently there is no general
characterization of which polytopal digraphs are LP digraphs, although four
necessary properties are known: acyclicity, unique sink orientation(USO), the
Holt-Klee property and the shelling property. The shelling property was
introduced by Avis and Moriyama (2009), where two examples are given in $d=4$
dimensions of polytopal digraphs satisfying the first three properties but not
the shelling property. The smaller of these examples has $n=7$ vertices. Avis,
Miyata and Moriyama(2009) constructed for each $d \ge 4$ and $n \ge d+2$, a
$d$-polytope $P$ with $n$ vertices which has a polytopal digraph which is an
acyclic USO that satisfies the Holt-Klee property, but does not satisfy the
shelling property. The construction was based on a minimal such example, which
has $d=4$ and $n=6$. In this paper we explore the shelling condition further.
First we give an apparently stronger definition of the shelling property, which
we then prove is equivalent to the original definition. Using this stronger
condition we are able to give a more general construction of such families. In
particular, we show that given any 4-dimensional polytope $P$ with $n_0$
vertices whose unique sink is simple, we can extend $P$ for any $d \ge 4$ and
$n \ge n_0 + d-4$ to a $d$-polytope with these properties that has $n$
vertices. Finally we investigate the strength of the shelling condition for
$d$-crosspolytopes, for which Develin (2004) has given a complete
characterization of LP orientations.

phase variations are observed for transiting hot Jupiters with current

planet (Kepler 10 b) and one non-transiting gas giant (Ups A b). Future
telescopes (JWST and EChO) will have the capability to measure thermal phase
curves of exoplanets including hot rocky planets in transiting and

possibility to use multi-wavelengths infrared phase curves to constrain the
radius, the albedo and the orbital inclination of a non-transiting planet with
no atmosphere and on a 1:1 spin orbit resonance. Methods. We model the thermal
emission of a synchronous rocky planet with no atmosphere and its apparent
variation with the orbital phase for a given orbital inclination. We assume
that the planet is detected by radial velocity so its orbital period and
minimum mass are known. We simulate observed noisy phase curves and then apply
a procedure to retrieve the radius and albedo of the planet and the inclination
of the orbit. Results. Airless planets can be distinguished from planets having
a dense atmosphere and their radius, albedo and inclination (and therefore true
mass) can be retrieved from multiband observations with MIRI-JWST and EChO in
the 5-15 {\mu}m range. [...] As inclination above 60{\deg} represents half of
randomly oriented orbits, the growing population of short-period
terrestrial-sized planets detected by radial velocity surveys and transits

self-reported diagnosis. In addition to classification performance we report
moderately strong Spearman's Rho correlation by comparing classifier output

is explosively dispersed, the particles often develop a non-uniform spatial
distribution. The instabilities within the particle bed and at the particle
layer interface likely form on the timescale of the shock propagation through
the particles. The mesoscale perturbations are manifested at later times in
experiments by the formation of coherent clusters of particles or jet-like
particle structures, which are aerodynamically stable. A number of different
mechanisms likely contribute to the jet formation including shock fracturing of
the particle bed and particle-particle interactions in the early stages of the
dense gas-particle flow. Aerodynamic wake effects at later times contribute to
maintaining the stability of the jets. The experiments shown in this fluid

illustrate the formation of particle jets during the explosive dispersal
process. The number of jet-like structures that are generated during the

number of jets, but they fragment and dissipate sooner. When the particle bed

traditional indicator networks are lacking. In this paper we address the issue
of systematically evaluating online health news to support automatic alerting

BioCaster. For 18 data sets produced by BioCaster, we compare 5 aberration
detection algorithms (EARS C2, C3, W2, F-statistic and EWMA) for performance
against expert moderated ProMED-mail postings. Results: We report sensitivity,

mean alerts/100 days and F1, at 95% confidence interval (CI) for 287
ProMED-mail postings on 18 outbreaks across 14 countries over a 366 day period.
Results indicate that W2 had the best F1 with a slight benefit for day of week

granular choice of country-level modeling, sudden drops in reporting due to day
of week effects and reporting bias. Automatic alerting has been implemented in

alerts have the potential to enhance manual analytical methods by increasing
throughput, timeliness and detection rates. Systematic evaluation of health

scattered by spin-fluctuations in the rare regions. This leads to singular
temperature dependencies not just at the quantum critical point, but in the
entire Griffiths phase. We show that the resulting non-universal power-laws in
transport properties are controlled by the same Griffiths exponent $\lambda$
which governs the thermodynamics. $\lambda$ takes the value zero at the quantum
critical point and increases throughout the Griffiths phase. We also study some
of the ""universal"" ratios commonly used to characterize Fermi-liquid behavior.

motivated by the work done for a conformally related diffractive model problem
by Friedlander, in which an explicit solution was constructed using the Airy
function. This work was later generalized by Melrose and by Taylor, via the
method of parametrix construction. Our setting is a simple case of
asympotically anti-de Sitter spaces, which are Lorentzian manifolds modeled on
anti-de Sitter space at infinity but whose boundary are not totally geodesic
(unlike the exact anti-de Sitter space). Most technical difficulties of the
problem reduce to studying and constructing a global resolvent for a
semiclassical ODE on $\RR^+$, which at one end is a b-operator (in the sense of
Melrose) while having a scattering behavior at infinity. We use different
techniques near 0 and infinity to analyze the local problems: near infinity we
use local resolvent bounds and near zero we build a local semiclassical
parametrix. After this step, the `gluing' method by Datchev-Vasy serves to
combine these local estimates to get the norm bound for the global resolvent.

decomposition of a low-rank matrix in a recursive manner, we embed an
approximation of the original matrix into a larger, but highly structured
sparse one that allows fast factorization and application of the inverse. The
algorithm extends the Martinsson/Rokhlin method developed for 2D boundary
integral equations and proceeds in two phases: a precomputation phase,
consisting of matrix compression and factorization, followed by a solution
phase to apply the matrix inverse. For boundary integral equations which are
not too oscillatory, e.g., based on the Green's functions for the Laplace or
low-frequency Helmholtz equations, both phases typically have complexity O(N)
in two dimensions, where $N$ is the number of discretization points. In our
current implementation, the corresponding costs in three dimensions are
$O(N^{3/2})$ and $O(N \log N)$ for precomputation and solution, respectively.
Extensive numerical experiments show a speedup of $\sim 100$ for the solution
phase over modern fast multipole methods; however, the cost of precomputation
remains high. Thus, the solver is particularly suited to problems where large
numbers of iterations would be required. Such is the case with ill-conditioned
linear systems or when the same system is to be solved with multiple right-hand
sides. Our algorithm is implemented in Fortran and freely available.

magnetic field amplification in the universe. More recently Semikoz and
Sokoloff [Phys Rev Lett 92 (2004): 131.301.] showed that the weakness of the
seed fields did not necessarily imply the weakness of magnetic cosmological
helicity. In this paper we present a derivation of dynamo equation based upon
the flat torsion photon non-minimal coupling through Riemann-Cartan spacetime.
From this derivation one computes the necessary conditions for a flat torsion
field to generate a galactic dynamo seed, from the cosmological magnetic
helicity. A peculiar feature of this dynamo equation is that the resistivity
depends upon the Ricci scalar curvature. This feature is also present in
turbulent dynamo models. Here the electrical effective conductivity is obtained
by making use of flat torsion modes of a $R(\Gamma)F^{2}$ Lagrangean where R
refers to the Ricci-Cartan spacetime. Power spectrum of the magnetic field is
also computed. Lorentz violation appears naturally from birefrigence of photons
semi-minimally coupled to torsion. Though Dobado and Maroto [Mod Phys Lett A
12: 3003 (1997)] have previously investigated the role of primordial torsion in
the anisotropy of light propagation they made it using the fermionic sector of
the QED Lagrangean while we obtained similar results using the photonic sector.
They also used the pseudo-trace of torsion while we here work out with the

photon-torsion coupling and a Lagrangean of the type $RF^{2}$ it is possible to
find a fast decoupling between magnetic and torsion fields in the contracting
phases of the universe. Besides torsion field decays as $K\sim{a^{2/3}}$ while
the magnetic field grows as $B\sim{a^{-5.5}}$ thus explaining the fast
decoupling between the two fields. It is expected that at some point of the
contracting phase the amplification of the magnetic field may give rise to a

biased toward small \Lambda, and to try to avoid this bias we modify his model
in a way that the number of observers is proportional to the number of

likelihood of the primordial density perturbation amplitude from this model is
high, while the likelihood from Weinberg's model is low. Furthermore, observers
will be affected by the history of the collapsed object, and we introduce a
method to calculate the anthropic likelihoods of \Lambda and Q from the mass
history using the extended Press-Schechter formalism. The anthropic likelihoods
for $\Lambda$ and Q from this method are similar to those from our single mass
constraint model, but, unlike models using the single mass constraint which
always have degeneracies between \Lambda and Q, the results from models using
the mass history are robust even if we allow both \Lambda and Q to vary. In the
case of Weinberg's flat prior distribution of \Lambda (pocket based multiverse

nitrogen ions. Structure changes including car-bonization and oxidation were
observed in the modified surface layer of PE by Raman spec-troscopy, FTIR ATR
spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, surface energy measurement and XPS
spectroscopy. An observed high surface energy of the modified polyethylene was
attributed to the presence of free radicals on the surface. The surface energy
decay with stor-age time after PIII treatment was explained by a decay of the
free radical concentration while the concentration of oxygen-containing groups
increased with storage time. Horseradish per-oxidase was covalently attached
onto the modified PE surface. The enzymatic activity of co-valently attached
protein remained high. A mechanism based on the covalent attachment by the
reaction of protein with free radicals in the modified surface is proposed.
Appropriate blocking agents can block this reaction. All aminoacid residues can
take part in the covalent attachment process, providing a universal mechanism
of attachment for all proteins. The long-term activity of the modified layer to
attach protein (at least 2 years) is explained by stabilisa-tion of unpaired
electrons in sp2 carbon structures. The native conformation of attached
pro-tein is retained due to hydrophilic interactions in the interface region. A
high concentration of free radicals on the surface can give multiple covalent
bonds to the protein molecule and de-stroy the native conformation and with it
the catalytic activity. The universal mechanism of protein attachment to free
radicals could be extended to various methods of radiation damage of polymers.

field (a few x 10^{10} G) but an anomalously large (~ 64%) pulse fraction in
its surface X-ray emission. We explore the idea that a substantial sub-surface
magnetic field exists in the NS crust, which produces diffuse hot spots on the
stellar surface due to anisotropic heat conduction, and gives rise to the
observed X-ray pulsation. We develop a general-purpose method, termed
""Temperature Template with Full Transport"" (TTFT), that computes the synthetic
pulse profile of surface X-ray emission from NSs with arbitrary magnetic field
and surface temperature distributions, taking into account magnetic atmosphere
opacities, beam pattern, vacuum polarization, and gravitational light bending.
We show that a crustal toroidal magnetic field of order a few x 10^{14} G or
higher, varying smoothly across the crust, can produce sufficiently distinct
surface hot spots to generate the observed pulse fraction in the Kes 79 NS.
This result suggests that substantial sub-surface magnetic fields, much
stronger than the ""visible"" dipole fields, may be buried in the crusts of some
young NSs, and such hidden magnetic fields can play an important role in their
observational manifestations. The general TTFT tool we have developed can also
be used for studying radiation from other magnetic NSs.

  scalar-field theory case","22 pages",,"10.1007/JHEP11(2011)087",,"hep-lat hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a thermal field theory, the cumulants of the momentum distribution can be
extracted from the dependence of the Euclidean path integral on a shift in the
fields built into the temporal boundary condition. When combined with the Ward
identities associated with the invariance of the theory under the Poincare'
group, thermodynamic potentials such as the entropy or the pressure can be
directly inferred from the response of the system to the shift. Crucially the
argument holds, up to harmless finite-size and discretization effects, even if
translational and rotational invariance are broken to a discrete subgroup of
finite shifts and rotations such as in a lattice box. The formulas are thus
applicable at finite lattice spacing and volume provided the derivatives are
replaced by their discrete counterpart, and no additive or multiplicative
ultraviolet-divergent renormalizations are needed to take the continuum limit.
In this paper we present a complete derivation of the relevant formulas in the
scalar field theory, where several technical complications are avoided with
respect to gauge theories. As a by-product we obtain a recursion relation among
the cumulants of the momentum distribution, and formulae for finite-volume
corrections to several well-known thermodynamic identities.

  Italy, May 2011",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive stars lose a large fraction of their original mass over the course of
their evolution. These stellar winds shape the surrounding medium according to
parameters that are the result of the characteristics of the stars, varying
over time as the stars evolve, leading to both permanent and temporary features
that can be used to constrain the evolution of the progenitor star.
  Because long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are thought to originate from massive
stars, the characteristics of the circumstellar medium (CSM) should be
observable in the signal of GRBs. This can occur directly, as the
characteristics of the GRB-jet are changed by the medium it collides with, and
indirectly because the GRB can only be observed through the extended
circumstellar bubble that surrounds each massive star.
  We use computer simulations to describe the circumstellar features that can
be found in the vicinity of massive stars and discuss if, and how, they may
appear in GRB observations. Specifically, we make hydrodynamical models of the
circumstellar environment of a rapidly rotating, chemically near-homogeneous
star, which is represents a GRB progenitor candidate model.
  The simulations show that the star creates a large scale bubble of shocked
wind material, which sweeps up the interstellar medium in an expanding shell.
Within this bubble, temporary circumstellar shells, clumps and voids are
created as a result of changes in the stellar wind. Most of these temporary
features have disappeared by the time the star reaches the end of its life,
leaving a highly turbulent circumstellar bubble behind. Placing the same star
in a high density environment simplifies the evolution of the CSM as the more
confined bubble prohibits the formation of some of the temporary structures.

$\omega$ coincides with the droplet exponent $\omega_{DP}(D=d-1)$ of the
Directed Polymer with $D=(d-1)$ transverse directions. Our main conclusions are
(i) whenever $\omega>0$, the quantum model is governed by an Infinite-Disorder
fixed point : there are two distinct correlation length exponents related by
$\nu_{typ}=(1-\omega)\nu_{av}$ ; the distribution of the local susceptibility
$\chi_{loc}$ presents the power-law tail $P(\chi_{loc}) \sim
1/\chi_{loc}^{1+\mu}$ where $\mu$ vanishes as $\xi_{av}^{-\omega} $, so that
the averaged local susceptibility diverges in a finite neighborhood $0<\mu<1$
before criticality (Griffiths phase) ; the dynamical exponent $z$ diverges near
criticality as $z=d/\mu \sim \xi_{av}^{\omega}$ (ii) in dimensions $d \leq 3$,
any infinitesimal disorder flows towards this Infinite-Disorder fixed point
with $\omega(d)>0$ (for instance $\omega(d=2)=1/3$ and $\omega(d=3) \sim 0.24$)
(iii) in finite dimensions $d > 3$, a finite disorder strength is necessary to
flow towards the Infinite-Disorder fixed point with $\omega(d)>0$ (for instance
$\omega(d=4) \simeq 0.19$), whereas a Finite-Disorder fixed point remains
possible for a small enough disorder strength. For the Cayley tree of effective

Breit-Wigner resonance peak in the invariant dilepton mass distributions in the
same way as the well-known extra gauge $Z'$ bosons. However, the $Z^*$ bosons
have unique signatures in transverse momentum, angular and pseudorapidity
distributions of the final leptons, which allow one to distinguish them from
other heavy neutral resonances. In 2010, with 40 pb$^{-1}$ of the LHC
proton-proton data at the energy 7 TeV, the ATLAS detector was used to search
for narrow resonances in the invariant mass spectrum of $e^+e^-$ and
$\mu^+\mu^-$ final states and high-mass charged states decaying to a charged
lepton and a neutrino. No statistically significant excess above the Standard
Model expectation was observed. The exclusion mass limits of 1.15 TeV$/c^2$ and
1.35 TeV$/c^2$ were obtained for the chiral neutral $Z^*$ and charged $W^*$
bosons, respectively. These are the first direct limits on the $W^*$ and $Z^*$
boson production. For almost all currently considered exotic models the
relevant signal is expected in the central dijet rapidity region. On the
contrary, the chiral bosons do not contribute to this region but produce an
excess of dijet events far away from it. For these bosons the appropriate
kinematic restrictions lead to a dip in the centrality ratio distribution over
the dijet invariant mass instead of a bump expected in the most exotic models.

  Stellar Astrophysics, 14-20 April, Lijiang, China",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is commonly accepted that a neutron star is produced, when a massive star
exhausts its nuclear fuel and ends its life in a core-collapse supernova
explosion. This scenario is confirmed by the detection of pulsars, which are
believed to be rapidly spinning neutron stars, in the central regions of many
supernova remnants. Neutron stars and their associated supernova remnants
should therefore have the same ages. As expected, the age of the Crab Pulsar,
the first to be connected with a supernova remnant (the Crab Nebula), can be
inferred from its current spin period and its derivative and indeed has about
the same age of the supernova remnant, that was produced from a historically
recorded supernova explosion in 1054. However most neutron stars appear to be
much older than the ages of their associated supernova remnants, a puzzle not
yet understood. Another puzzle is that so far no convincing evidence has been
found in favor of magnetic field decay in neutron stars, that is predicted in
most models of neutron stars. Here we show convincing evidence of magnetic
field decay in some young neutron stars, and that the magnetic field decay can
alter their spinning behaviors significantly such that these neutron stars
appear much older than they really are.

materials overlaying cracked and jointed underlying pavements. The high
concentration of stresses and strains in the vicinity of the discontinuity of
the old pavement causes the cracks to reflect into the newly placed HMA
overlay. While it is a common practice to use skewed transverse joints in rigid
pavements to improve the latter's performance, the impact of such a practice on
the cracking of a potential HMA overlay has not been examined so far. In this
context, this study investigates the effect of using skewed transverse joints
in rigid pavements on reflective cracking development in the HMA overlay.
Advanced three-dimensional Finite Element models including viscoelastic
material properties for the HMA overlay, 3D beam modeling of dowel bars,
non-uniform tire-pavement contact stresses, friction interfaces, and infinite
boundary elements were constructed for both normal and skewed transverse joints
using ABAQUS v-6.11. The potential for reflective cracking was monitored
through the fracture mechanics J-integral parameter. Results obtained show,
among other things, that the practice of skewing transverse joints increases
the potential for reflective cracking development in the asphalt concrete
overlay.

observations of a solar quiescent prominence (QP) that exhibits highly variable
dynamics suggestive of turbulence. These images capture a sufficient range of
scales spatially ($\sim$0.1-100 arc seconds) and temporally ($\sim$16.8 s - 4.5
hrs) to allow the application of statistical methods used to quantify finite
range fluid turbulence. We present the first such application of these
techniques to the spatial intensity field of a long lived solar prominence.
Fully evolved inertial range turbulence in an infinite medium exhibits
multifractal \emph{scale invariance} in the statistics of its fluctuations,
seen as power law power spectra and as scaling of the higher order moments
(structure functions) of fluctuations which have non-Gaussian statistics;
fluctuations $\delta I(r,L)=I(r+L)-I(r)$ on length scale $L$ along a given
direction in observed spatial field $I$ have moments that scale as $<\delta
I(r,L)^p>\sim L^{\zeta(p)}$. For turbulence in a system that is of finite size,
or that is not fully developed, one anticipates a generalized scale invariance
or extended self-similarity (ESS) $<\delta I(r,L)^p>\sim G(L)^{\zeta(p)}$. For
these QP intensity measurements we find scaling in the power spectra and ESS.
We find that the fluctuation statistics are non-Gaussian and we use ESS to
obtain ratios of the scaling exponents $\zeta(p)$: these are consistent with a
multifractal field and show distinct values for directions longitudinal and
transverse to the bulk (driving) flow. Thus, the intensity fluctuations of the
QP exhibit statistical properties consistent with an underling turbulent flow.

  We study the influence of non-synaptic plasticity on the default dynamical

on intrinsic neural parameters, such as the threshold and the gain, and is
driven by the optimization of the information entropy. We observe, in the
presence of the intrinsic adaptation processes, three distinct and globally

intermittent bursting regime. The intermittent bursting regime is characterized
by intervals of regular flows, which are quite insensitive to external stimuli,
interseeded by chaotic bursts which respond sensitively to input signals. We

force-extension diagrams, some, notably DNA, exhibit non-trivial behavior with
a distinct plateau region. Here we propose a unified theory that connects
force-extension characteristics of the polymer chain with the convexity
properties of the extension energy profile of its individual monomer subunits.
Namely, if the effective monomer deformation energy as a function of its
extension has a non-convex (concave up) region, the stretched polymer chain
separates into two phases: the weakly and strongly stretched monomers.
Simplified planar and 3D polymer models are used to illustrate the basic
principles of the proposed model. Specifically, we show rigorously that when
the secondary structure of a polymer is mostly due to weak non-covalent
interactions, the stretching is two-phase, and the force-stretching diagram has
the characteristic plateau. We then use realistic coarse-grained models to
confirm the main findings and make direct connection to the microscopic
structure of the monomers. We demostrate in detail how the two-phase scenario
is realized in the \alpha-helix, and in DNA double helix. The predicted plateau
parameters are consistent with single molecules experiments. Detailed analysis
of DNA stretching demonstrates that breaking of Watson-Crick bonds is not
necessary for the existence of the plateau, although some of the bonds do break
as the double-helix extends at room temperature. The main strengths of the
proposed theory are its generality and direct microscopic connection.

components, in order to investigate the luminosity evolution of the supernova,

distributions, in order to estimate how much new dust condensed in the ejecta.
The luminosity evolution was consistent with the decay of 56Co in the ejecta up

agreement with the findings of Kotak et al. (2009). Clumped dust density
distributions consisting of 20% amorphous carbons and 80% silicates by mass

discreteness destabilizes the dark-soliton configurations, which become stable
only inside the continuum regime. Continuation from the anti-continuum limit is
also considered, and a rich bifurcation structure is revealed.

relativistic quantum mechanics to investigate the electromagnetic properties of
two-body bound systems with spin 0 and spin 1. Elastic scattering of an
electron by the bound state is treated as a two-channel problem for a
Bakamjian-Thomas-type mass operator. In this way retardation effects in the
photon-exchange interaction are fully taken into account. The electromagnetic
bound-state current is extracted from the one-photon-exchange optical
potential. Wrong cluster properties, inherent in the Bakamjian-Thomas framework
for more than 2 particles, are seen to cause spurious (unphysical)
contributions in the current, which are associated with a dependence on the sum
of the electron momenta. The Lorentz structure of our current resembles the one
obtained from an explicitly covariant light-front approach, where spurious
contributions also show up and are associated with a four-vector describing the
orientation of the light front. For spin-0 systems, like a charged pion, the
spurious contributions can be eliminated by choosing the total invariant mass
of the electron-bound-state system large enough. In this case equivalence with
the usual front-form expression for the form factor, resulting from a spectator
current in the q^+=0 reference frame, is established. For spin-1 systems, like
a charged rho meson or the deuteron, some spurious contributions cannot be
completely eliminated by solely choosing an infinitely large invariant mass.
Nevertheless, there is an unambiguous way how to separate them from the
physical contributions such that one is left with a physical bound-state
current with the required properties.

which the global expansion is given by a Friedmann-like equation. We show that
if these models are constructed in a particular way then the redshifts of

the other hand, differ from those found in the corresponding FLRW models, while
being consistent with the 'empty beam' approximation, together with the
shearing effects due to the nearest masses. This can be compared with the large
deviations found from the corresponding FLRW values obtained in a previous
study that considered LW models constructed in a different way. We therefore
advocate the improved LW models we consider here as useful constructions that

designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It
will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark
matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry
of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission
is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak
gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid
payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field
of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of ~0.54 deg2:
the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains
a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey
will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20
deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies
per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric
redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) < 0.05. They are
derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0
micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from
public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a
spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless
spectrometer, with spectral resolution ~250, predominantly detects Ha emission
line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision
2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also
known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.

which the original data of the interference is known a priori. Such a priori
knowledge is common in wireless relay networks. For example, a transmitting
relay could be relaying data that was previously transmitted by a node, in
which case the interference received by the node now is actually self
information. Besides the case of self information, the node could also have
overheard or received the interference data in a prior transmission by another
node. Directly removing the known interference requires accurate estimate of
the interference channel, which may be difficult in many situations. In this
paper, we propose a novel scheme, Blind Known Interference Cancellation (BKIC),
to cancel known interference without interference channel information. BKIC
consists of two steps. The first step combines adjacent symbols to cancel the
interference, exploiting the fact that the channel coefficients are almost the
same between successive symbols. After such interference cancellation, however,
the signal of interest is also distorted. The second step recovers the signal
of interest amidst the distortion. We propose two algorithms for the critical
second steps. The first algorithm (BKIC-S) is based on the principle of
smoothing. It is simple and has near optimal performance in the slow fading
scenario. The second algorithm (BKIC-RBP) is based on the principle of
real-valued belief propagation. It can achieve MAP-optimal performance with
fast convergence, and has near optimal performance even in the fast fading
scenario. Both BKIC schemes outperform the traditional self-interference
cancellation schemes with perfect initial channel information by a large
margin, while having lower complexities.

of two-way relay channels. An interesting variant of PNC is Analog Network
Coding (ANC). Almost all ANC schemes proposed to date, however, operate in a
symbol by symbol manner (memoryless) and cannot exploit the redundant
information in channel-coded packets to enhance performance. This paper
proposes a non-memoryless ANC scheme. In particular, we design a soft-input
soft-output decoder for the relay node to process the superimposed packets from
the two end nodes to yield an estimated MMSE packet for forwarding back to the
end nodes. Our decoder takes into account the correlation among different
symbols in the packets due to channel coding, and provides significantly
improved MSE performance. Our analysis shows that the SNR improvement at the
relay node is lower bounded by 1/R (R is the code rate) with the simplest LDPC
code (repeat code). The SNR improvement is also verified by numerical
simulation with LDPC code. Our results indicate that LDPC codes of different
degrees are preferred in different SNR regions. Generally speaking, smaller
degrees are preferred for lower SNRs.

energy for s=1/2 are in good agreement with recent large-scale density-matrix

ground-state selection depends on the spin quantum number s. While for the
extreme quantum case, s=1/2, the q=0 state is energetically favored by quantum
fluctuations, for any s>1/2 the sqrt{3} x sqrt{3} state is selected. For both
the sqrt{3} x sqrt{3} and the q=0 states the magnetic order is strongly
suppressed by quantum fluctuations. Within our coupled cluster method we get
vanishing values for the order parameter (sublattice magnetization) M for s=1/2

been recently discussed in connection with the non trivial zeros of the Riemann
zeta function. We show that all these models are covariant under general
coordinate transformations. This remarkable property becomes explicit in the
Lagrangian formulation which describes a relativistic particle moving in a 1+1
dimensional spacetime whose metric is constructed from the functions U and V.
General covariance is maintained by quantization and we find that the spectra
are closely related to the geometry of the associated spacetimes. In
particular, the Hamiltonian H_I corresponds to a flat spacetime, whereas its
spectrum approaches the Riemann zeros in average. The latter property also
holds for the model H_II, whose underlying spacetime is asymptotically flat.
These results suggest the existence of a Hamiltonian whose underlying spacetime
encodes the prime numbers, and whose spectrum provides the Riemann zeros.

host galaxies is of key importance when addressing selection effects in the GRB
redshift distribution, and when studying the properties of their host galaxies.
As well as the implications for GRB research, probing the dust within the
high-z hosts of GRBs also contributes to our understanding of the conditions of
the interstellar medium and star-formation in the distant Universe.
Nevertheless, the physical properties of dust within GRB host galaxies
continues to be a highly contended issue. In this paper we explore the mean
extinction properties of dust within the host galaxies of a sample of 17 GRBs
with total host galaxy visual extinction Av<1 (<Av>=0.4), covering a redshift
range z=0.7-3.1. We find the average host extinction curve to have an
ultraviolet slope comparable to that of the LMC, but with little evidence of a
2175Angs dust extinction feature as observed along Milky Way and LMC
sightlines. We cannot at present rule out the presence of a 2175Angs feature,
and both the standard SMC and LMC extinction curves also provide good fits to
our data. However, we can reject an extinction curve that has a UV slope as
flat as the mean Milky Way extinction curve, whilst also having a 2175Angs
feature as prominent as seen in the mean Milky Way extinction curve. This is in
contrast to the clear detection of a 2175Angs bump and the flatter extinction
curves of some more heavily extinguished GRBs (Av>1), which may be indicative
of there being a dependence between dust abundance and the wavelength
dependence of dust extinction, as has been previously speculated.

is a sequence of points {x=x_0,x_1, ...,x_n=y} such that d(f(x_i),x_{i+1}) <

an omega-limit set for some point in X, and that the same is also true for the
tent map with slope equal to 2. In this paper, we prove that for tent maps
whose critical point c=1/2 is periodic, every closed, internally chain

there are at least countably many tent maps with non-recurrent critical point

v$_2$, v$_3$ and v$_4$ are almost unchanged down to the lower colliding energy

decline. In this state, the dust acts like a natural coronagraph at visible
wavelengths, allowing faint nebulosity around the star to be seen. Imaging has
been obtained from 0.5 to 500 micron with Gemini/GMOS, HST/WFPC2, Spitzer/MIPS,
and Herschel/SPIRE. Several of the structures around R CrB are cometary
globules caused by wind from the star streaming past dense blobs. The estimated
dust mass of the knots is consistent with their being responsible for the R CrB
declines if they form along the line of sight to the star. In addition, there
is a large diffuse shell extending up to 4 pc away from the star containing
cool 25 K dust that is detected all the way out to 500 micron. The SED of R CrB
can be well fit by a 150 AU disk surrounded by a very large diffuse envelope
which corresponds to the size of the observed nebulosity. The total masses of
the disk and envelope are 10^-4 and 2 M(Sun), respectively, assuming a
gas-to-dust ratio of 100. The evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger or
a final-helium-shell flash origin for R CrB is contradictory. The shell and the
cometary knots are consistent with a fossil planetary nebula. Along with the
fact that R CrB shows significant Lithium in its atmosphere, this supports the
final-helium-shell flash. However, the relatively high inferred mass of R CrB
and its high fluorine abundance support a white-dwarf merger.

a target. In that context, an optical system consisting of a laser and a

the high finesse cavity with a gain of 1000. A digital feedback system is used
to keep the cavity at the length required for the optimal power enhancement.
Preliminary measurements show that a flux of about $4\times10^6 \gamma$/s with
an average energy of about 24 MeV was generated. Several upgrades currently in

When oxygen is scarce, carbon
particles nucleate into solid particles called soot. These particles emit
photons, making the flame yellow. Later, methane is pre-mixed with air forming
a blue flame; burning more efficiently, providing less soot and light.
  Imaging flames and knowing their temperature are vital to maximizing
efficiency and validating numerical models. Most temperature probes disrupt the
flame and create differences leading to an inaccurate measurement of the flame
temperature. We seek to image the flame in three dimensions using synthetic
aperture imaging. This technique has already successfully measured velocity
fields of a vortex ring [1].
  Synthetic aperture imaging is a technique that views one scene from multiple
cameras set at different angles, allowing some cameras to view objects that are
obscured by others. As the resulting images are overlapped different depths of
the scene come into and out of focus, known as focal planes, similar to
tomography. These focal planes can be used to extract three-dimensional
information about the scene. This procedure was used to extract the outer edge
of a oxygen-starved methane flame (yellow) from which the three-dimensional
flame was reconstructed. When the reconstructed image was compared to the raw

details the transient evolution of the free surface surrounding the impact
region of a low-viscosity laminar liquid jet as it enters a quiescent pool. The
close-up images depict the destabilization and breakup of the annular air gap
and the subsequent entrainment of bubbles into the bulk liquid.
