relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD and RMHD). The current release exploits,
in addition to the static grid version of the code, the distributed
infrastructure of the CHOMBO library for multidimensional parallel computations
over block-structured, adaptively refined grids. We employ a conservative
finite-volume approach where primary flow quantities are discretized at the
cell-center in a dimensionally unsplit fashion using the Corner Transport
Upwind (CTU) method. Time stepping relies on a characteristic tracing step
where piecewise parabolic method (PPM), weighted essentially non-oscillatory
(WENO) or slope-limited linear interpolation schemes can be handily adopted. A
characteristic decomposition-free version of the scheme is also illustrated.
The solenoidal condition of the magnetic field is enforced by augmenting the
equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) providing propagation
and damping of divergence errors through a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic explicit
cleaning step. Among the novel features, we describe an extension of the scheme
to include non-ideal dissipative processes such as viscosity, resistivity and
anisotropic thermal conduction without operator splitting. Finally, we
illustrate an efficient treatment of point-local, potentially stiff source
terms over hierarchical nested grids by taking advantage of the adaptivity in
time. Several multidimensional benchmarks and applications to problems of
astrophysical relevance assess the potentiality of the AMR version of PLUTO in
resolving flow features separated by large spatial and temporal disparities.

scheme with binning and successive decoding. Therefore, binning helps reduce
decoding complexity by allowing successive decoding, but has no impact on
achievable rate for the one-way relay channel. On the other hand, no binning
simplifies relay operation. By extending compress-forward without binning to
the two-way relay channel, we can achieve a larger rate region than the
original compress-forward scheme when the channel is asymmetric for the two
users. Binning and successive decoding limits the compression rate to match the
weaker of the channels from relay to two users, whereas without binning, this
restriction no longer applies. Compared with noisy network coding,
compress-forward without binning achieves the same rate region in certain
Gaussian channel configurations, and it has much less delay. This work is a

at an edge and outputs the multi-dimensionally upwinded fluxes in both

two-dimensional HLL Riemann solvers. The HLL Riemann solver presented here
achieves its stabilization by introducing a constant state in the region of
strong interaction, where four one-dimensional Riemann problems interact
vigorously with one another. A robust version of the HLL Riemann solver is
presented here along with a strategy for introducing sub-structure in the
strongly-interacting state. Introducing sub-structure turns the two-dimensional
HLL Riemann solver into a two-dimensional HLLC Riemann solver. The
sub-structure that we introduce represents a contact discontinuity which can be
oriented in any direction relative to the mesh.
  The Riemann solver presented here is general and can work with any system of
conservation laws. We also present a second order accurate Godunov scheme that
works in three dimensions and is entirely based on the present multidimensional
HLLC Riemann solver technology. The methods presented are cost-competitive with

the analysis can be reduced to the case of an electron localized at the
intersection of two orthogonal crossed wires of different width. Numerical
calculations show that the fundamental mode of this system remains bound for
the widths that we have been able to study directly; moreover, the
extrapolation of the results obtained for finite widths suggests that this
state remains bound even when the width of one arm becomes infinitesimal. We
provide a qualitative argument which explains this behavior and that can be
generalized to the lowest energy states in each symmetry class. In the case of
odd-odd states of the cross we find that the lowest mode is bounded when the
width of the two arms is the same and stays bound up to a critical value of the
ratio between the widths; in the case of the even-odd states we find that the
lowest mode is unbound up to a critical value of the ratio between the widths.

single-particle spectrum as well as the corresponding SC gap function. The
inversion procedure is analogous to the quasiparticle interference (QPI) effect
in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Whereas angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and STM provide surface sensitive information, our

essentially model independent and can be applied to a wide variety of

simulations cover a range of initial orbital characteristics and gas-to-stellar
mass fractions (from 0 to 20%), and include star formation and supernova
feedback. We confirm and extend previous results by showing that the specific
angular momentum of the stellar component always decreases independently of the
orbital parameters or morphology of the satellite, and that the decrease in the
rotation velocity of the primary galaxy is accompanied by a change in the
anisotropy of the orbits. However, the decrease affects only the old stellar
population, and not the new population formed from gas during the merging
process. This means that the merging process induces an increasing difference
in the rotational support of the old and young stellar components, with the old
one lagging with respect to the new. Even if our models are not intended
specifically to reproduce the Milky Way and its accretion history, we find
that, under certain conditions, the modeled rotational lag found is compatible
with that observed in the Milky Way disk, thus indicating that minor mergers
can be a viable way to produce it. The lag can increase with the vertical
distance from the disk midplane, but only if the satellite is accreted along a
direct orbit, and in all cases the main contribution to the lag comes from
stars originally in the primary disk rather than from stars in the satellite
galaxy. We also discuss the possibility of creating counter-rotating stars in
the remnant disk, their fraction as a function of the vertical distance from
the galaxy midplane, and the cumulative effect of multiple mergers on their
creation.

polarized and remains a powerful probe of the magnetic field structure in the
outer regions of circumstellar envelopes if observed with high angular and
spectral resolutions. Observations in all four Stokes parameters are quite
sparse and this is the most thorough, systematic study published to date.
  Aims: We aim to determine polarization properties of OH masers in an
extensive sample of stars that show copious mass loss and search for candidate
objects that are well-suited for high angular resolution studies.
  Methods: Full-polarization observations of the OH 1612 and 1667 MHz maser
transitions were carried out for a sample of 117 AGB and post-AGB stars.
Several targets were also observed in the 1665 MHz line.
  Results: Polarized features occur in more than 75% of the sources in the
complete sample and there is no intrinsic difference in the occurrence of
polarized emission between the three classes of objects of different infrared
characteristics. The highest fractional polarization occurs for the post-AGB+PN
and the Mira+SR classes at 1612 and 1667 MHz, respectively. Differences in the
fractional polarization between the sources at different evolutionary stages
appear to be related to depolarization caused by blending. The alignment of the
polarization angles at the extreme sides of the shell implies a regular
structure of the magnetic field of a strength of 0.3-2.3 mG.
  Conclusions: Polarized OH maser features are widespread in AGB and post-AGB
stars. The relationship between the circular and linear fractional
polarizations for a representative sample are consistent with the standard
models of polarization for the Zeeman splitting higher than the Doppler line
width, whereas the polarized features are the sigma components.

first-order phase transition, but also the infinite-order Kosterlitz-Thouless
quantum phase transition, which cannot be revealed either by the energy of the

nearest-neighbor spins are entangled, they, unexpectedly, never violate the

Bell inequality.

by a narrow rung in the transverse direction. This system can be implemented in
self-attractive Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), as well as in a nonlinear
bulk optical waveguide.We demonstrate that the introduction of the transverse
link changes the character of the symmetry-breaking bifurcation (SBB) in the
system from subcritical to supercritical (in terms of the corresponding phase
transition, it is a change between the first and second kinds). A noteworthy
feature of the SBB in this setting is a non-monotonous dependence of the
soliton's norm at the bifurcation point on the strength of the transverse link.
In the full 2D system, the results are obtained in a numerical form. An exact
analytical solution is found for the bifurcation in the 1D version of the
model, with the transverse rung modeled by the local linear coupling between
the parallel troughs with the Delta-functional longitudinal profile. Replacing
the Delta-function by its finite-width Gaussian counterpart, similar results
are obtained by means of the variational approximation (VA). The VA is also
applied to the 1D system with a mixed linear and nonlinear transverse localized
coupling. Comparison of the results produced by the different varieties of the
system clearly reveals basic features of the symmetry-breaking transition in
it.

predictions for a new stem P0 and kink-turn motif. These elements structure the
linker between the RNAs' double aptamers. Chemical mapping on the F. nucleatum
riboswitch with SHAPE, DMS, and CMCT probing, mutate-and-map studies, and
mutation/rescue experiments all provide strong evidence for the structured
linker. Under solution conditions that separate two glycine binding
transitions, disrupting this helix-junction-helix structure gives 120-fold and
6- to 30-fold poorer association constants for the two transitions,
corresponding to an overall energetic impact of 4.3 \pm 0.5 kcal/mol. Prior
biochemical and crystallography studies from several labs did not include this
critical element due to over-truncation of the RNA. We argue that several
further undiscovered elements are likely to exist in the flanking regions of
this and other RNA switches, and automated prediction tools can now play a
powerful role in their detection and dissection.

fractions of different galaxy morphological types vary with global environment

limited galaxy samples with log10 M\star/M\bigodot>= 10.25, we find a smooth
increase/decline in the fraction of Es-S0s/late type galaxies going from single
galaxies, to binaries, to groups. Considering all environments, the fractional
variation is more conspicuous for S0s and late-types than for ellipticals
solely due to a sharp enhancement/dearth of S0s/late-types in clusters compared
to other environments. The morphological distribution of galaxies in the mass
range 10.25 < log10 M\star/M\bigodot < 11 is rather independent both of galaxy
stellar mass and global environment, except in clusters. The morphologies of
galaxies more massive than log10 M\star/M\bigodot = 11 are instead a function
of both galaxy mass and global environment. The morphology-mass relation
therefore changes with global environment, showing that galaxy stellar mass
cannot be the only parameter driving the morphological distribution of
galaxies. The morphology-mass relations for S0 and late-type galaxies in
clusters are peculiar compared to other environments, and this strongly
suggests that cluster-specific effects act on these two types of galaxies, and
that a significant number of S0s in clusters has a different origin with

stars to investigate the implications of the new scenario that the observed
sample of Hypervelocity stars could partly originate from a dwarf-host galaxy
collision. We use a suite of N-body simulations following the encounter of a
satellite galaxy with its Milky Way-type host galaxy to gather statistics on
the properties of stripped-off stars. We study especially the orbital energy
distribution of this population.
  We quantify the typical pattern in angular and phase space formed by the
debris stars. We further develop a simple stripping model predicting the
kinematics of stripped-off stars. We show that the distribution of orbital
energies in the tidal debris has a typical form which can be described quite
accurately by a simple function. Based on this we develop a method to predict
the energy distribution which allows us to evaluate the significance and the
implications of high velocity stars in satellite tidal debris.
  Generally tidal collisions of satellite galaxy produce stars which escape
into the intragalactic space even if the satellite itself is on a bound orbit.
The main parameters determining the maximum energy kick a tidal debris star can
get is the initial mass of the satellite and only to a lower extent its orbit.
Main contributors to an unbound stellar population created in this way are
massive satellites (M_sat > 10^9 M_sun). We thus expect intragalactic stars to
have a metallicity higher than the surviving satellite population of the Milky
Way. However, the probability that the observed HVS population is significantly
contaminated by tidal debris stars appears small in the light of our results.

new class of spotted late-B stars, in which evolving surface chemical
inhomogeneities are apparently unrelated to the presence of strong magnetic
fields but are produced by some hitherto unknown astrophysical mechanism. The
goal of this study is to perform a detailed line profile variability analysis
and carry out a sensitive magnetic field search for one of the brightest HgMn
stars - mu Lep. We acquired a set of very high-quality intensity and
polarization spectra of mu Lep with the HARPSpol polarimeter. These data were
analyzed with the multiline technique of least-squares deconvolution in order
to extract information on the magnetic field and line profile variability. Our
spectra show very weak but definite variability in the lines of Sc, all Fe-peak
elements represented in the spectrum of mu Lep, as well as Y, Sr, and Hg.
Variability might also be present in the lines of Si and Mg. Anomalous profile
shapes of Ti II and Y II lines suggest a dominant axisymmetric distribution of
these elements. At the same time, we found no evidence of the magnetic field in
mu Lep, with the 3 sigma upper limit of only 3 G for the mean longitudinal
magnetic field. This is the most stringent upper limit on the possible magnetic
field derived for a spotted HgMn star. The very weak variability detected for
many elements in the spectrum mu Lep suggests that low-contrast chemical
inhomogeneities may be common in HgMn stars and that they have not been
recognized until now due to the limited precision of previous spectroscopic
observations and a lack of time-series data. The null result of the magnetic

X-ray spectrum. Two different scenarios have been invoked to explain its X-ray
properties: wind-wind interaction and magnetic wind confinement. Yet, HD 93250
shows absolutely constant radial velocities over time scales of years
suggesting either a single star, a binary system seen pole-one or a very long
period and/or highly eccentric system. Using the ESO Very Large Telescope
Interferometer, we resolved HD 93250 as a close pair with similar components.
We measured a near-infrared flux ratio of 0.8+/-0.1 and a separation of
1.5+/-0.2 x 10E-03 arcsec. At the distance of Carina, this corresponds to a
projected physical distance of 3.5 A.U. While a quantitative investigation
would require a full characterization of the orbit, the binary nature of HD
93250 allows us to qualitatively explain both its X-ray flux and hardness and
its non-thermal radio emission in the framework of a colliding wind scenario.
We also discuss various observational biases. We show that, due to
line-blending of two similar spectral components, HD 93250 could have a period
as short as one to several years despite the lack of measurable radial velocity
variations.

in between the isothermal and Keplerian regime and vary with mass: there is
tentative evidence that the less massive galaxies have steeper potential

initial mass function to disentangle the stellar and dark matter components.
The fraction of dark matter within five effective radii increases with mass, in

scenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (CR)
diffusion on the morphology and CR distribution of the bubbles. We show that
even a relatively low level of viscosity (\mu_{visc} >~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or
~0.1% - 1% of Braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppress
the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,
resulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. Furthermore, viscosity reduces
circulating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix the
CR-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. Thus
viscosity naturally produces an edge-favored CR distribution, an important
ingredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightness
distribution. Generically, such a CR distribution often produces a
limb-brightened gamma-ray intensity distribution. However, we show that by
incorporating CR diffusion which is strongly suppressed across the bubble
surface (as inferred from sharp bubble edges) but is close to canonical values
in the bubble interior, we obtain a reasonably flat gamma-ray intensity
profile. The similarity of the resulting CR bubble with the observed Fermi
bubbles strengthens our previous result in Paper I that the Fermi bubbles were
produced by a recent AGN jet event. Studies of the nearby Fermi bubbles may
provide a unique opportunity to study the potential roles of plasma viscosity

photometric data acquired at the INT and (V,i') photometric data available in
the Subaru Archive. X-ray data from the XMM-Newton Science Archive are analyzed
to study the hot gas component. We estimate the cluster redshift <z>=0.177, a
high line-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion, sigmaV about 1350 km/s, and X-ray
temperature T about 6.4 keV. Both our optical and X-ray analyses reveal a
complex dynamical activity. The analysis of the 2D galaxy distribution reveals
the presence of two density peaks, one at the East and the other at the West.
Using the full 3D information we detect a high LOS velocity (DeltaV about 3000
km/s), low mass group at the position of the 2D eastern peak. For the main
system we compute a velocity dispersion sigmaV about 1000-1200 km/s. In the
assumption of a bimodal system we estimate a mass M=1.5-2.9 10^15 solar
masses.The X-ray morphological analysis confirms that Abell 2254 is a
dynamically disturbed cluster. The X-ray isophotes are elongated toward the
eastern direction, in agreement with a merger in the post core-crossing phase.
A simple bimodal model finds that data are consistent with a bound, outgoing
subcluster observed a few fractions of Gyr after the core crossing. However,
both optical and X-ray analyses suggest that the main system is, at its time, a
non relaxed structure, indicating N-S as a possible direction for a past
accretion. We conclude that Abell 2254, for its mass and merging structure,
fits well among typical clusters with radio halos. We shortly discuss as the
particular irregularity of the radio halo might be linked to the complexity of
the Abell 2254 structure.

the present generation of PMS models which allows for a quantitative comparison
with observations, largely superseding the widely used isochrones and tracks
qualitative superposition.
  Using the available PMS data we tested the newest PISA PMS models
establishing their good agreement with the observations. The data cover a mass
range from ~0.3 to ~3.1 Msun, temperatures from ~3x10^3 to ~1.2x10^4 K and
luminosities from ~3x10^-2 to ~60 Lsun. Masses are correctly predicted within
20% of the observed values in most of the cases and for some of them the
difference is as small as 5%. Nevertheless some discrepancies are also observed
and critically discussed.
  By means of simulations, using typical observational errors, we evaluated the
spread of log \tau_sim - log \tau_rec, i.e. simulated minus recovered ages
distribution of the single objects. We also found that stars in binary systems
simulated as coeval might be recovered as non coeval, due to observational
errors. The actual fraction of fake non coevality is a complex function of the
simulated ages, masses and mass ratios. We demonstrated that it is possible to
recover the systems' ages with better precision than for single stars using the
composite age-probability distribution, i.e. the product of the components' age
distributions. Using this valuable tool we estimated the ages of the presently
observed PMS binary systems.

if, in addition to the accretion disc, there is a population of cold, thick
clouds at approximately 30R_S which reprocess the intrinsic continuum.
Exploring cloud parameter space, I find that clouds with density n~10^12 cm^-3
and column N_H >4 X 10^24 cm^-2 reflect most of the intrinsic continuum, but
convert a substantial fraction of the EUV luminosity into lines, dominated by
Ly-beta and HeII Ly-alpha. When velocity-blurred, this makes a false continuum
peak at ~1100A which fits the observed SED well, but turns back up in the FUV
to make a hard EUV SED, as required by ionisation models. I argue that the
observed UV variability is dominated by this component of fixed shape, possibly
due to changes of covering factor. The amount of mass required is small, so it
is not necessary to disrupt the disc, but only to make an unstable and
inhomogeneous atmosphere. The proposed clouds may be related to those suggested
by several X-ray phenomena (X-ray reflection components, high-velocity
outflows, Compton thick partial covering) but are not the same, leading to a
picture with a wide range of inhomogeneous structures at different radii.

without vanishing 6-cycles, which we classify, and propose for them field
theory duals. We then study in detail the cone over Q^111 and find agreement
between the spectrum of baryonic operators in this theory and M5 branes
wrapping 5-cycles in the Q^111 space. The physics of vacua in which these
symmetries are spontaneously broken precisely matches a dual gravity analysis
involving resolutions of the singularity, where we are able to match
condensates, Goldstone bosons and global strings. We then study the
implications of turning on a torsion 4-form flux. This flux non-trivially
affects the supergravity dual of Higgsing, and we show that the supergravity
and field theory analyses precisely match in an example based on Y^12(CP^2). We
then explain how the choice of M-theory circle can result in exotic
renormalization group flows. We also argue that theories where the resolutions
have 6-cycles are expected to receive non-perturbative corrections from M5
instantons. We give a general formula relating the instanton action to
normalizable harmonic 2-forms.

symmetries in the AdS_5/CFT_4 correspondence. This leads, for particular vacuum
expectation values, to the emergence of baryonic symmetries during the
renormalization group flow. We identify these vacuum expectation values with
critical values of the B-field moduli in the dual supergravity backgrounds. We
study in detail the C^3/Z_3 orbifold theory and the dual supergravity
backgrounds that correspond to the breaking of the emerging baryonic

theory of the type A_{N-1} in a generic Coulomb branch. For such terms, the
supergravity calculation could be trusted. We calculate the WZ term on
supergravity side and show that it could compensate the anomaly deficit, as is
required by the anomaly matching condition. In contrast with the SYM theory, in
which each WZ term involves one root e_{i}-e_{j}, here, the typical WZ term
involves two roots e_{i}-e_{j} and e_{k}-e_{j}. Such kind of triple interaction
may come from the integrating out of the massive states carrying three indices.
A natural candidate is the recently proposed 1/4 BPS objects in the Coulomb
phase of the 6d (2, 0) theories. The WZ term could be derived from the field
theory by the integration out of massive degrees of freedom. Without the 6d (2,
0) theory at hand, we take the supersymmetric equations for the 3-algebra
valued (2, 0) tensor multiplet as the prototype to see how far we can go. The
H_{3}\wedge A_{3} part of the WZ term is obtained, while the A_{3}\wedge F_{4}
part, which is the term accounting for the anomaly matching, cannot be produced
by the standard fermion loop integration.

the influence of the free energy surface on the association of more hydrophilic

detector is realized with a precision wideband digitizer connected through a
pair of symmetric active guarded transformers to the outputs of the shunts
under comparison. Data are first acquired asynchronously, and then transferred
from on-board memory to host memory. Because of the large amount of data
collected the filtering process and the analysis algorithms are performed
outside the acquisition routine. Most of the systematic errors can be
compensated by a proper inversion procedure.
  The system is suitable for comparing shunts in a wide range of currents, from
several hundred of milliampere up to 100 A, and frequencies ranging between 500
Hz and 100 kHz. Expanded uncertainty (k=2) less than 0.05 mrad, for frequency
up to 100 kHz, is obtained in the measurement of the phase difference of a
group of 10 A shunts, provided by some European NMIs, using a digitizer with
sampling frequency up to 1 MHz. An enhanced version of the phase comparator
employs a new digital phase detector with higher sampling frequency and
vertical resolution. This permits to decrease the contribution to the
uncertainty budget of the phase detector of a factor two from 20 kHz to 100
kHz. Theories and experiments show that the phase difference between two high
precision wideband digitizers, coupled as phase detector, depends on multiple

in dynamics as a conventional expanding blast wave decelerates when bumping

relativistic pulsar wind bumping into its surrounding nebula induces
energy-generating processes and initiates a detonation wave that propagates
outward to form the current outer edge, namely the shock front, of the nebula.
The resulting detonation wave, with a reactive downstream, then provides the
needed power to maintain propagation of the shock front. Furthermore,
relaxation of the curvature-induced reduction of the propagation velocity from
the initial state of formation to the asymptotic, planar state of
Chapman-Jouguet propagation explains the observed accelerative expansion. The
essential role of detonative propagation in the structure and dynamics of the
Crab nebula offers potential richness in incorporating reactive fronts in the

transmitters base their transmission schemes on local views of the channel

four channel gains, which may be mismatched from the other transmitter.
  We consider a set of seven local views, and find that for five out of the
seven local views, TDM is sufficient to achieve the qualified notion of
capacity region for the linear deterministic interference channel which
approximates the Gaussian interference channel. For these five local views, the
qualified capacity result implies that no policy can achieve a rate point
outside the TDM region without inducing a corner case of sub-TDM performance in
another channel state. The common trait shared by the two remaining local views
- those with the potential to outperform TDM - is transmitter knowledge of the

emphasizing their importance in creating opportunities to coordinate usage of
more advanced schemes.

central black holes (BHs). In this paper we explore the influence of
supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) on their actions as gravitational
lenses. When lenses are modelled as singular isothermal ellipsoids, binary
black holes change the critical curves and caustics differently as a function
of distance. Each black hole can in principle create at least one additional
image, which, if observed, provides evidence of black holes. By studying how
SMBBHs affect the cumulative distribution of magnification for images created
by black holes, we find that the cross section for at least one such additional
image to have a magnification larger than $10^{-5}$ is comparable to the cross
section for producing multiple-images in singular isothermal lenses. Such
additional images may be detectable with high-resolution and large dynamic
range maps of multiply-imaged systems from future facilities, such as the SKA.
The probability of detecting at least one image (two images) with magnification
above $10^{-3}$ is $\sim 0.2 \fBH$ ($\sim 0.05 \fBH$) in a multiply-imaged lens
system, where $\fBH$ is the fraction of galaxies housing binary black holes. We
also study the effects of SMBBHs on the core images when galaxies have
shallower central density profiles (modelled as non-singular isothermal
ellipsoids). We find that the cross section of the usually faint core images is
further suppressed by SMBBHs. Thus their presence should also be taken into
account when one constrains the core radius from the lack of central images in
gravitational lenses.

luminosity from single O-stars scales linearly with bolometric luminosity, Lx ~
10^-7 Lbol. But straightforward forms of the most favored model, in which
X-rays arise from instability-generated shocks embedded in the stellar wind,
predict a steeper scaling, either with mass loss rate Lx ~ Mdot ~ Lbol^1.7 if
the shocks are radiative, or with Lx ~ Lx ~ Mdot^2 ~ Lbol^3.4 if they are
adiabatic. We present here a generalized formalism that bridges these radiative
vs. adiabatic limits in terms of the ratio of the shock cooling length to the
local radius. Noting that the thin-shell instability of radiative shocks should
lead to extensive mixing of hot and cool material, we then propose that the
associated softening and weakening of the X-ray emission can be parametrized by
the cooling length ratio raised to a power m, the ""mixing exponent."" For
physically reasonable values m ~= 0.4, this leads to an X-ray luminosity Lx ~
Mdot^0.6 ~ Lbol that matches the empirical scaling. We conclude by noting that
such thin-shell mixing may also be important for X-rays from colliding wind
binaries, and that future numerical simulation studies will be needed to test
this thin-shell mixing ansatz for X-ray emission.

We compute
the free-fall time ($\tff$) for finite, uniform, self-gravitating circular
sheets and filamentary clouds of small but finite thickness, so that their
volume density $\rho$ can still be defined. We find that, for thin sheets, the
free-fall time is larger than that of a uniform sphere with the same volume
density by a factor proportional to $\sqrt{A}$, where the aspect ratio $A$ is
given by $A=R/h$, $R$ being the sheet's radius and $h$ is its thickness. For
filamentary clouds, the aspect ratio is defined as $A=L/\calR$, where $L$ is
the filament's half length and $\calR$ is its (small) radius, and the
modification factor is a more complicated, although in the limit of large $A$
it again reduces to nearly $\sqrt{A}$. We propose that our result for
filamentary shapes naturally explains the ubiquitous configuration of clumps
fed by filaments observed in the densest structures of molecular clouds. Also,
the longer free-fall times for non-spherical geometries in general may
contribute towards partially alleviating the ""star-formation conundrum"",
namely, that the star formation rate in the Galaxy appears to be proceeding in
a timescale much larger than the total molecular mass in the Galaxy divided by
its typical free-fall time. If molecular clouds are in general formed by thin
sheets and long filaments, then their relevant free-fall time may have been
systematically underestimated, possibly by factors of up to one order of
magnitude.

inequalities of great interest, both in pure and applied mathematics. Although
the original historical motivation was the study of the stability properties of
the Hill equation (which applies to many problems in physics and engineering),
other questions that arise in systems at resonance, crystallography,
isoperimetric problems, Rayleigh type quotients, etc. lead to the study of
$L_p$ Lyapunov inequalities ($1\leq p\leq \infty$) for differential equations.
In this work we review some recent results on these kinds of questions which
can be formulated as optimal control problems. In the case of Ordinary
Differential Equations, we consider periodic and antiperiodic boundary
conditions at higher eigenvalues and by using a more accurate version of the
Sturm separation theory, an explicit optimal result is obtained. Then, we
establish Lyapunov inequalities for systems of equations. To this respect, a
key point is the characterization of the best $L^p$ Lyapunov constant for the
scalar given problem, as a minimum of some especial (constrained or
unconstrained) variational problems defined in appropriate subsets of the usual
Sobolev spaces. For Partial Differential Equations on a domain $\Omega \subset
\real^N$, it is proved that the relation between the quantities $p$ and $N/2$
plays a crucial role in order to obtain nontrivial $L_p$ Lyapunov type
inequalities (which are called Sobolev inequalities by many authors). This fact
shows a deep difference with respect to the ordinary case. Combining the linear
results with Schauder fixed point theorem, we can obtain some new results about
the existence and uniqueness of solutions for resonant nonlinear problems for
ODE or PDE, both in the scalar case and in the case of systems of equations

Ks_0=12.4 at l=+10{\deg}. We detect a change in the orientation of the bar in
the central regions with |l|<4{\deg} at b=\pm1{\deg}, in agreement with results
obtained at positive latitudes by other authors. Our results are based on a
different dataset and at different latitude, which shows that this change in
the bar orientation is real. This suggests that there is an inner structure
distinct to the large-scale Galactic bar, with a different orientation angle.
This inner structure could be a secondary, inner bar, with a semi-major axis of
~500 pc that is symmetric with respect to the Galactic plane.

double-null formalism. We require cosmological stability to f(R) models; we
used the Starobinsky model and the R + (1/2)cR^2 model. Charged black holes in
f(R) gravity can have a new type of singularity due to higher curvature
corrections, the so-called f(R)-induced singularity, although it is highly
model-dependent. As the advanced time increases, the internal structure will
approach the Cauchy horizon, which may not be an inner apparent horizon. There
is mass inflation as one approaches the Cauchy horizon and hence the Cauchy
horizon may be a curvature singularity with nonzero area. However, the Ricci
scalar is finite for an out-going null observer. This can be integrated as
follows: Cosmologically stable higher curvature corrections of the Ricci scalar
made it bounded even in the presence of mass inflation. Finally, we conjecture
that if there is a general action including general higher curvature
corrections with cosmological stability, then the corrections can make all
curvature components finite even in the presence of mass inflation. This might
help us to resolve the problem of inner horizon instability of regular black
hole models.

5128) using a new method based on spectroastrometry of a rotating gas disk. The
spectroastrometric approach consists in measuring the photocenter position of
emission lines for different velocity channels. In a previous paper we focused
on the basic methodology and the advantages of the spectroastrometric approach
with a detailed set of simulations demonstrating the possibilities for black
hole mass measurements going below the conventional spatial resolution. In this
paper we apply the spectroastrometric method to multiple longslit and integral
field near infrared spectroscopic observations of Centaurus A. We find that the
application of the spectroastrometric method provides results perfectly
consistent with the more complex classical method based on rotation curves: the
measured BH mass is nearly independent of the observational setup and spatial
resolution and the spectroastrometric method allows the gas dynamics to be
probed down to spatial scales of ~0.02"", i.e. 1/10 of the spatial resolution
and ~1/50 of BH sphere of influence radius. The best estimate for the BH mass
based on kinematics of the ionized gas is then log(MBH (sin i)^2/M\odot)=7.5
\pm 0.1 which corresponds to MBH = 9.6(+2.5-1.8) \times 10^7 M\odot for an
assumed disk inclination of i = 35deg. The complementarity of this method with
the classic rotation curve method will allow us to put constraints on the disk
inclination which cannot be otherwise derived from spectroastrometry. With the
application to Centaurus A, we have shown that spectroastrometry opens up the
possibility of probing spatial scales smaller than the spatial resolution,
extending the measured MBH range to new domains which are currently not
accessible: smaller BHs in the local universe and similar BHs in more distant
galaxies.

  In this paper, we provide an algorithm that connects an arbitrary point set
in $O(\log n)$ slots, improving on the previous best bound of $O(\log^2 n)$ due
to Moscibroda. This is complemented with a super-constant lower bound on our
approach to connectivity. An important feature is that the algorithms allow for
bi-directional (half-duplex) communication.
  One implication of this result is an improved bound of $\Omega(1/\log n)$ on
the worst-case capacity of wireless networks, matching the best bound known for
the extensively studied average-case.
  We explore the utility of oblivious power assignments, and show that
essentially all such assignments result in a worst case bound of $\Omega(n)$
slots for connectivity. This rules out a recent claim of a $O(\log n)$ bound
using oblivious power. On the other hand, using our result we show that
$O(\min(\log \Delta, \log n \cdot (\log n + \log \log \Delta)))$ slots suffice,
where $\Delta$ is the ratio between the largest and the smallest links in a
minimum spanning tree of the points.
  Our results extend to the related problem of minimum latency aggregation
scheduling, where we show that aggregation scheduling with $O(\log n)$ latency
is possible, improving upon the previous best known latency of $O(\log^3 n)$.

Class I sources, and we find the detection rate for Class I objects in this

with previous works. For detected objects we examine correlations of radio
luminosity with bolometric luminosity and envelope mass and find that these
data support correlations found by previous samples, but do not show any
indiction of the evolutionary divide hinted at by similar data from the Perseus
molecular cloud when comparing radio luminosity with envelope mass. We conclude
that envelope mass provides a better indicator for radio luminosity than
bolometric luminosity, based on the distribution of deviations from the two
correlations. Combining these new data with archival 3.6cm flux densities we
also examine the spectral indices of these objects and find an average spectral
index of 0.53+/-1.14, consistent with the canonical value for a partially

Near the imaginary axis away from the origin, there is a replica symmetric

that this suggests the absence of the temperature chaos. To confirm this, we
investigate the multiple many-body interacting case which is known to exhibit

from correlated two dimensional topological insulators. Adiabatic deformation
of the inhomogeneous spin structure generates the spin gauge flux, which
induces adiabatic charge and spin polarization currents. The unit pumped
charge/spin are determined by the product of two topological invariants which
are defined in momentum and real spaces, respectively. The same topological
invariants determine the charge and spin quantum numbers of skyrmion textures.
It is found that in noncentrosymmetric systems, a new topological phase, dubbed
the topological chiral magnetic insulator, exists in which a skyrmion defect is
a spin-1/2 fermion with electric charge $e$. Considering the adiabatic current
responses of generic inhomogeneous systems, it is shown that the quantized
topological response of chiral magnetic insulators is endowed with the second

using sparse local models of image appearance. These models, where small image
patches are represented as linear combinations of a few elements drawn from
some large set (dictionary) of candidates, have proven well adapted to several
image restoration tasks. A key to their success has been to learn dictionaries
adapted to the reconstruction of small image patches. In contrast, recent works
have proposed instead to learn dictionaries which are not only adapted to data
reconstruction, but also tuned for a specific task. We introduce here such an
approach to deblurring and digital zoom, using pairs of blurry/sharp (or
low-/high-resolution) images for training, as well as an effective stochastic
gradient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization task. Although
this learning problem is not convex, once the dictionaries have been learned,
the sharp/high-resolution image can be recovered via convex optimization at
test time. Experiments with synthetic and real data demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, leading to state-of-the-art performance
for non-blind image deblurring and digital zoom.

show that for those models, the Maxwell Stress is larger due to strong
axisymmetric magnetic fields, generated by the \alpha \Omega dynamo. Large
radial extended axisymmetric toroidal fields trigger temporal magnification of
accretion stress. All models display a positive dynamo-\alpha in the northern
hemisphere (upper disk). The parity is distinct in each model and changes on
timescales of 40 local orbits. In model 2\pi, the toroidal field is mostly
antisymmetric in respect to the midplane. The eddies of the MRI turbulence are
highly anisotropic. The major wavelengths of the turbulent velocity and
magnetic fields are between one and two disk scale heights. At the midplane, we

the variational principle, a new family of maximizing trajectories is obtained,
whose members are able to connect any two points of the de Sitter spacetime.
These geodesics introduce a new notion of motion, given by a combination of
translations and proper conformal transformations, which may possibly become
important at very-high energies, where conformal symmetry plays a significant
role.

operation in public key cryptography) can be performed using digital
expansions. Apart from rational integer bases (double-and-add algorithm),
imaginary quadratic integer bases are of interest for elliptic curve
cryptography, because the Frobenius endomorphism fulfils a quadratic equation.
One strategy for improving the efficiency is to increase the digit set (at the
prize of additional precomputations). A common choice is the width\nbd-$w$
non-adjacent form (\wNAF): each block of $w$ consecutive digits contains at
most one non-zero digit. Heuristically, this ensures a low weight, i.e.\ number
of non-zero digits, which translates in few costly curve operations. This paper
investigates the following question: Is the \wNAF{}-expansion optimal, where
optimality means minimising the weight over all possible expansions with the
same digit set?
  The main characterisation of optimality of \wNAF{}s can be formulated in the
following more general setting: We consider an Abelian group together with an
endomorphism (e.g., multiplication by a base element in a ring) and a finite
digit set. We show that each group element has an optimal \wNAF{}-expansion if
and only if this is the case for each sum of two expansions of weight 1. This
leads both to an algorithmic criterion and to generic answers for various
cases.
  Imaginary quadratic integers of trace at least 3 (in absolute value) have
optimal \wNAF{}s for $w\ge 4$. The same holds for the special case of base
$(\pm 3\pm\sqrt{-3})/2$ and $w\ge 2$, which corresponds to Koblitz curves in
characteristic three. In the case of $\tau=\pm1\pm i$, optimality depends on
the parity of $w$. Computational results for small trace are given.

N = 2 AdS supersymmetry does not allow existence of a linear VT multiplet. For
the nonlinear VT multiplet, we derive consistent superfield constraints in the

supersymmetric action and elaborate on the N = 1 superfield and component

superfield constraints and Lagrangian that describe the linear VT multiplet in

gauges the central charge. These supergravity constructions thus provide the

function of environment based on data from the zCOSMOS survey. There is a fair
amount of evidence that galaxy properties depend on mass of groups and
clusters, in the sense that quiescent galaxies prefer more massive systems. We
base our analysis on a mass-selected environment using X-ray groups of galaxies
and define the group membership using a large number of spectroscopic redshifts
from zCOSMOS. We show that the fraction of red galaxies is higher in groups
than in the field at all redshifts probed in our study. Interestingly, the
fraction of [OII] emitters on the red sequence increases at higher redshifts in
groups, while the fraction does not strongly evolve in the field. This is due
to increased dusty star formation activities and/or increased activities of
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in high redshift groups. We study these
possibilities using the 30-band photometry and X-ray data. We find that the
stellar population of the red [OII] emitters in groups is old and there is no
clear hint of dusty star formation activities in those galaxies. The observed
increase of red [OII] emitters in groups is likely due to increased AGN
activities. However, our overall statistics is poor and any firm conclusions
need to be drawn from a larger statistical sample of z~1 groups.

validate the processes and to derive reliable output values. For consistency, a
single method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevant
global asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of the
background signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of the
power excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility of
non-radial modes. A method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed,
which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillation
spectrum. The comparison of the different methods has shown the important role
of the way the background is modelled. The convergence reached by the
collaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning the
oscillation power excess. We obtain several scaling relations, and identify the
influence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. The effect of helium
burning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strong
mass-radius relation for clump stars. We find that none of the amplitude
scaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observed
mode amplitudes of red giant stars. In parallel, the degree-dependent mode
visibility exhibits important variations. Both effects seem related to the
significant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. A family

obscured AGNs that form the X-ray background at z < 1, the associated faint
radio emission lies just beyond the sensitivity limits of the deepest surveys.
Here, we search for this level of star formation by studying a sample of 359
X-ray selected AGNs at z < 1 from the COSMOS field that are not detected by
current radio surveys. The AGNs are separated into bins based on redshift,
X-ray luminosity, obscuration, and mid-infrared characteristics. An estimate of
the AGN contribution to the radio flux density is subtracted from each radio
image, and the images are then stacked to uncover any residual faint radio flux
density. All of the bins containing 24 micron-detected AGNs are detected with a
signal-to-noise >3sigma in the stacked radio images. In contrast, AGNs not
detected at 24 microns are not detected in the resulting stacked radio images.
This result provides strong evidence that the stacked radio signals are likely
associated with star formation. The estimated star formation rates derived from
the radio stacks range from 3 solar masses per year to 29 solar masses per
year. Although it is not possible to associate the radio emission with a
specific region of the host galaxies, these results are consistent with the
predictions of nuclear starburst disks in AGN host galaxies.

structure depends on the knowledge of the fundamental stellar parameters.
Long-base interferometers permit us to determine very accurate stellar radii,
which are independent constraints for stellar models that help us to locate the
star in the HR diagram. Aims: Using a direct interferometric determination of
the angular diameter and advanced three-dimensional (3D) modeling, we derive
the radius of the CoRoT target HD 49933 and reduce the global stellar parameter
space compatible with seismic data. Methods: The VEGA/CHARA
spectro-interferometer is used to measure the angular diameter of the star. A
3D radiative hydrodynamical simulation of the surface is performed to compute
the limb darkening and derive a reliable diameter from visibility curves. The
other fundamental stellar parameters (mass, age, and Teff) are found by fitting
the large and small p-mode frequency separations using a stellar evolution
model that includes microscopic diffusion. Results: We obtain a limb-darkened
angular diameter of {\theta}LD = 0.445 \pm 0.012 mas. With the Hipparcos
parallax, we obtain a radius of R = 1.42 \pm 0.04 Rsun. The corresponding
stellar evolution model that fits both large and small frequency separations
has a mass of 1.20 \pm 0.08 Msun and an age of 2.7 Gy. The atmospheric
parameters are Teff = 6640 \pm 100 K, log g = 4.21 \pm 0.14, and [Fe/H] =

of four real components one obtains four pairs of creation and annihilation
operators acting in a tensor space of states containing many units of quantum
information. There can be constructed position and momentum operators from the
creation and annihilation operators and based on these operators the Poincare

A general state in the tensor space can be mapped to a state in Minkowski
space-time by using the position representation of the eigenstates of the
occupation number operators which correspond to the eigenstates of the harmonic

Quantization of the coefficients of a general state in the tensor space leads
to many particle theory and thus to quantum field theory.

The dipole modes are the most common geometry of oscillations in
roAp stars inferred from photometric measurements and are therefore of special
interest for asteroseismic purposes. Aims. We present a theoretical and
analytical study of the light curves associated with dipole (l = 1) pulsations
of roAp stars in the framework of the revisited oblique pulsator model.
Methods. We describe the light curves in terms of the inclination and
polarization of the elliptical displacement vector of the dipole modes. We
study the influence of the magnetic field and rotation on the shape of these
light curves for both amplitudes and phases. Results. Despite the inclination
of dipole mode with respect to the magnetic axis, we find that the dipole mode
can have maxima that are in phase with the magnetic maxima. We apply our
formalism to the well-known roAp star HR 3831 (HD 83368) to derive its mode
properties. Our results are similar to those obtained by time-series
spectroscopy. We also consider the cases of three other roAp stars, HD 6532, HD
99563, and HD 128898 ({\alpha} Cir). Conclusions. We demonstrate that the
formalism of the revisited oblique pulsator model is adequate to explain the
properties of the photometric light curves associated with dipole modes in roAp
stars. In addition, we show that the coincidence of pulsation and magnetic
extrema can also occur for inclined modes with respect to the magnetic axis.
With the stars considered in this paper, we conclude that the polarization of
the modes present in roAp stars are quasi linearly polarized.

probabilities of existing. It is possible to query the edges of the graph, and
if the queried edge exists then its endpoints are irrevocably matched. The goal
is to find a querying strategy which maximizes the expected size of the
matching obtained. This stochastic matching setup is motivated by applications
in kidney exchanges and online dating.
  In this paper we address the query-commit problem from both theoretical and
experimental perspectives. First, we show that a simple class of edges can be
queried without compromising the optimality of the strategy. This property is
then used to obtain in polynomial time an optimal querying strategy when the
input graph is sparse. Next we turn our attentions to the kidney exchange
application, focusing on instances modeled over real data from existing
exchange programs. We prove that, as the number of nodes grows, almost every
instance admits a strategy which matches almost all nodes. This result supports
the intuition that more exchanges are possible on a larger pool of
patient/donors and gives theoretical justification for unifying the existing
exchange programs. Finally, we evaluate experimentally different querying
strategies over kidney exchange instances. We show that even very simple
heuristics perform fairly well, being within 1.5% of an optimal clairvoyant
strategy, that knows in advance the edges in the graph. In such a
time-sensitive application, this result motivates the use of committing
strategies.

three regimes. For low energy electrons (low initial {\gamma}-factor,
{\gamma}0) the radiation damping effects are negligible. At higher energies,
but still at 2{\gamma}0 < a0, the damping alters the final displacement and the
net energy change of the electron. For 2{\gamma}0 > a0 one is in a regime of
radiation reaction induced electron capture. This capture is found to be stable
with respect to the spatial properties of the electron beam and results in a
significant energy loss of the electrons. In this regime the plane wave model
of the laser field provides a good description of the dynamics, whereas for
lower energies the Gaussian beam and plane wave models differ significantly.

dependencies of thermal conductivity are very complicated, pointing to the
important role of spin excitations. It is found that magnetic excitations act
mainly as the phonon scatterers in a broad temperature region from 0.3 to 30 K.
In magnetic fields, the thermal conductivity show drastic changes, particularly
at the field-induced transitions from the low-field N\'{e}el state to the
spin-gapped state, the field-induced magnetic ordered state, and the spin
polarized state. In high fields, the phonon conductivity is significantly

model selection technique defined as a fixed point reached by iterating a

thresholding function has two regularization parameters $\lambda$ and $\nu$,
and a smoothness parameter $s$. It enjoys smoothness like ridge regression and
selects variables like lasso. Focusing on Gaussian regression, we show that
SBITE is uniquely defined, and that its Stein unbiased risk estimate is a
smooth function of $\lambda$ and $\nu$, for better selection of the two
regularization parameters. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to investigate
the predictive and oracle properties of this smooth version of adaptive lasso.
  The motivation is a gravitational wave burst detection problem from several
concomitant time series. A nonparametric wavelet-based estimator is developed
to combine information from all captors by block-thresholding multiresolution
coefficients. We study how the smoothness parameter $s$ tempers the erraticity
of the risk estimate, and derive a universal threshold, an information

Masayoshi's problem, giving an explicit and algebraically exact solution for
the symmetric case (particular case b = c, i.e., ABC \equiv right-angled
isosceles triangle), see (1.60) and (1.61).
  Despite the isosceles triangle restriction is not necessary, in view of the
complexity of the explicit algebraic solution for the symmetric case, one can
guessing the impossibility of achieving an explicit relationship for the
asymmetric case (the more general case: ABC \equiv right-angled scalene
triangle). For this case is given a proof of existence and uniqueness of
solution and a proof of the impossibility of getting such a relationship, even
implicitly, if the sextic equation (2.54) it isn't solvable. Nevertheless, in
(2.56) - (2.58) it is shown the way to solve the asymmetric case under the
condition that (2.54) be solvable. Furthermore, it is proved that with a slight
modification in the final set of variables (F), it is still possible to
establish a relation between them, see (2.59) and (2.61), which provides a
bridge that connects the primitive relationship by means of numerical methods,
for every given right-angled triangle ABC.
  And as the attempt to solve Fermat's conjecture (or Fermat's last theorem),
culminated more than three centuries later by Andrew Wiles, led to the
development of powerful theories of more general scope, the attempt to solve
the Masayoshi's problem has led to the development of the Theory of Overlapping
Polynomials (TOP), whose application to this problem reveals a great potential
that might be extrapolated to other frameworks.

Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria in this investigation. First time, we
increase its antibacterial activities by using electrical power while on
electrolysis synthesis and it is confirmed from its more antibacterial
activities (For Escherichia coli bacteria). We investigate the changes of
surface area to volume ratio of copper nanoparticles prepared in two different
methods and its effects on antibacterial activities. We note that slight change
of surface area to volume ratio results in the enhancement of its antibacterial
activities.
