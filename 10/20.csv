space (d>1) possesses at least one shortest generalized billiard trajectory
moreover, any of its shortest generalized billiard trajectories is of period at
most d+1. Actually, in the Euclidean plane we improve this theorem as follows.
A disk-polygon with parameter r>0 is simply the intersection of finitely many
(closed) circular disks of radii r, called generating disks, having some
interior point in common in the Euclidean plane. Also, we say that a
disk-polygon with parameter r>0 is a fat disk-polygon if the pairwise distances
between the centers of its generating disks are at most r. We prove that any of
the shortest generalized billiard trajectories of an arbitrary fat disk-polygon
is a 2-periodic one. Also, we give a proof of the analogue result for
{\epsilon}-rounded disk-polygons obtained from fat disk-polygons by rounding
them off using circular disks of radii {\epsilon}>0. Our theorems give partial
answers to the very recent question raised by S. Zelditch on characterizing
convex bodies whose shortest periodic billiard trajectories are of period 2.

mass difference in the temperature range where neutrino scatterings become
inefficient to enforce thermodynamical equilibrium. Depending on the value of

to 1% of the Crab Nebula gamma-ray flux. The detection of pulsed emission above

using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the tridiagonal method for the 2D
ferromagnetic square lattice stripe, where the SW modes are characterized by a
1D in-plane wave vector $q_x$. The results show a general and an unexpected
feature that the area and edge spin waves only exist as optic modes. This
behavior is also seen in 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnetic square lattice. This
absence of the acoustic modes in the 2D square lattice is explained by the fact
that the geometry constrains for NN exchange inside the square lattice allow
only optical modes. We suggest that this unexpected behavior of spin waves in
the 2D square lattice may be useful in realizing an explanation for HTS.

the residual positions show a scatter of ~0.2 mas (at 4 cm) and ~3 mas (at 13

there is a weak unresolved outflow, with varying size or opacity, during

systems with stiff relaxation in the so-called diffusion limit. In such regime
the system relaxes towards a convection-diffusion equation. The first objective
of the paper is to show that traditional partitioned IMEX R-K schemes will
relax to an explicit scheme for the limit equation with no need of modification
of the original system. Of course the explicit scheme obtained in the limit
suffers from the classical parabolic stability restriction on the time step.
The main goal of the paper is to present an approach, based on IMEX R-K
schemes, that in the diffusion limit relaxes to an IMEX R-K scheme for the
convection-diffusion equation, in which the diffusion is treated implicitly.
This is achieved by an original reformulation of the problem, and subsequent
application of IMEX R-K schemes to it. An analysis on such schemes to the
reformulated problem shows that the schemes reduce to IMEX R-K schemes for the
limit equation, under the same conditions derived for hyperbolic relaxation.
Several numerical examples including neutron transport equations confirm the
theoretical analysis.

hydrodynamical models. By varying the kinematic viscosity in the model we
calculate observable signatures associated with the emergence of a
super-rotating circumplanetary jet that strengthens with decreased viscosity.
We obtain excellent agreement between our mid-transit transit spectra and
existing data from Hubble and Spitzer, finding the best fit for intermediate
values of viscosity. We further exploit dynamically driven differences between
eastern and western hemispheres to extract the spectral signal imparted by a
circumplanetary jet. We predict that: (i) the transit depth should decrease as
the jet becomes stronger; (ii) the measured transit times should show timing
offsets of up to 6 seconds at wavelengths with higher opacity, which increases
with jet strength; (iii) wavelength-dependent differences between ingress and
egress spectra increase with jet strength; (iv) the color-dependent transit
shape should vary more strongly with wavelength for stronger jets. These
techniques and trends should be valid for other hot Jupiters as well.
Observations of transit timing offsets may be accessible with current
instrumentation, though the other predictions may require the capabilities JWST
and other future missions. Hydrodynamical models utilized solve the 3D

that the current helicity of active regions, as estimated by $-{\bf A \cdot B}$
evaluated at the depth from which the active region arises, resembles the
observational data much better than the small-scale current helicity calculated

allows us to calculate various observables of the neutron star in a way that

apparent surface area, which could play a role in measurements of neutron star
radii and, therefore, in constraining their equation of state. We show that
whether the spinning neutron star appears larger or smaller than its
non-rotating counterpart depends primarily on its equatorial radius. For
neutron stars with radii ~10 km, the corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime
cause the apparent surface area to increase with spin frequency. In contrast,
for neutron stars with radii ~15 km, the oblateness of the star dominates the
spacetime corrections and causes the apparent surface area to decrease with
increasing spin frequency. In all cases, the change in the apparent geometric
surface area for the range of observed spin frequencies is < 5% and hence only
a small source of error in the measurement of neutron star radii.

period. A fraction of these hot Jupiters have retrograde orbits with respect to
the parent star's rotation. To explain these observations we performed a series
of numerical integrations of planet scattering followed by the tidal
circularization. We considered planetary systems having 3 and 4 planets
initially. We found that the standard Kozai migration is an inefficient
mechanism for the formation of hot Jupiters.
  Our results show the formation of two distinct populations of hot Jupiters.
The inner population of hot Jupiters with semimajor axis a < 0.03 AU formed in
the systems where no planetary ejections occurred. This group contained a
significant fraction of highly inclined and retrograde orbits, with
distributions largely independent of the initial setup. However, our follow-up
integrations showed that this populations was transient with most planets
falling inside the Roche radius of the star in <1 Gyr. The outer population of
hot Jupiters formed in systems where at least one planet was ejected. This
population survived the effects of tides over >1 Gyr. The semimajor axis
distribution of Population II fits nicely the observed 3-day pile-up.
  The inclination distribution of the outer hot planets depends on the number
of planets in the initial systems and the 4-planet case showed a larger
proportion (up to 10%), and a wider spread in inclination values. As the later
results roughly agrees with observations, this may suggest that the planetary
systems with observed hot Jupiters were originally rich in the number of
planets, some of which were ejected. In a broad perspective, our work therefore
hints on an unexpected link between the hot Jupiters and recently discovered
free floating planets.

galaxy, is, quite ironically, the most atypical BCD known. This is because its
large exponential low-surface brightness envelope is not due to an old stellar
host but entirely due to extended nebular emission (ne) (Papaderos et al. 2002;
P02). We study IZw18 and IZw18C down to an unprecedently faint surface
brightness level using HST ACS data.
  We argue that the properties of IZw18C can be consistently accounted for by
propagating star formation over the past ~100 Myr, in combination with stellar
diffusion and the associated radial stellar mass filtering effect (P02).
  As for IZw18, we find that ne extends out to ~16 stellar scale lengths and
provides at least 1/3 of the total optical emission.
  The case of IZw18 suggests caution in studies of distant galaxies in dominant
stages of their evolution, rapidly assembling their stellar mass at high
specific star formation rates (SSFRs). It calls attention to the fact that ne
is not necessarily cospatial with the underlying ionizing and non-ionizing
stellar background, neither has to scale with its surface density. The
prodigious energetic output during dominant phases of galaxy evolution may
result in large exponential ne envelopes, extending much beyond the still
compact stellar component, just like in IZw18. Therefore, the morphological
paradigm of IZw18, while probably unique in the nearby Universe, may be
ubiquitous among high-SSFR galaxies at high redshift. Using IZw18 as reference,
we show that extended ne may introduce substantial observational biases and
significantly affect fundamental galaxy relations. Among others, we show that
the surface brightness profiles of distant morphological analogs to IZw18 may
be barely distinguishable from Sersic profiles with an exponent 2<n<5, thus
mimicking the profiles of massive galaxy spheroids. (abridged)

$J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$. The spectral representation for the
correlation functions of these operators are evaluated to the first order, and
the corresponding spectral densities are shown to be positive. Under the

intermediate wavenumber range. Through extensive computation of the transient
life of these waves, in typical shear flows, we can observe that the residual
energy they have when they leave the transient phase and enter into the final
exponential decay shows a spectrum that is very close to the -5/3 spectrum. The
observation times also show a similar scaling. The scaling depends on the
wavenumber only, i.e. it is not sensitive to the inclination of the waves to
the basic flow, the shape-symmetry of the initial condition and the Reynolds
number.

The result is obtained by extending the HD symmetric bracket and free energy to

equations of motion are obtained once one of the Casimirs of the Poisson
bracket for ideal MHD is identified with the total thermodynamical entropy of
the plasma. The metriplectic framework of MHD is shown to be invariant under

analogous to that found for the phase diagram (in electric field - temperature

high surface tilt the decay will exhibit a well defined spatial kink within

aspiration learning, a player continues to play an action as long as the
rewards received exceed a specified aspiration level. Here, the aspiration
level is a fading memory average of past rewards, and these levels also are
subject to occasional random perturbations. A player becomes dissatisfied
whenever a received reward is less than the aspiration level, in which case the
player experiments with a probability proportional to the degree of
dissatisfaction. Our first contribution is the characterization of the
asymptotic behavior of the induced Markov chain of the iterated process in
terms of an equivalent finite-state Markov chain. We then characterize
explicitly the behavior of the proposed aspiration learning in a generalized
version of coordination games, examples of which include network formation and
common-pool games. In particular, we show that in generic coordination games
the frequency at which an efficient action profile is played can be made
arbitrarily large. Although convergence to efficient outcomes is desirable, in
several coordination games, such as common-pool games, attainability of fair
outcomes, i.e., sequences of plays at which players experience highly rewarding
returns with the same frequency, might also be of special interest. To this
end, we demonstrate through analysis and simulations that aspiration learning
also establishes fair outcomes in all symmetric coordination games, including
common-pool games.

also show that while spirals are transient in amplitude, at any given time the
disk favors patterns of certain pattern speeds. Using several runs with
different numerical parameters we show that the properties of spirals that
occur spontaneously in the disk do not sensitively depend on resolution. The
existence of multiple transient patterns has large implications for the orbits

mechanisms that profoundly alter angular momenta of individual stars. We

which produced 73 GOES soft X-ray flares. The flares appear to show a departure
from the well known power-law frequency-size distribution. Specifically, too
few GOES C-class and no M-class flares were observed by comparison with a
power-law distribution (Wheatland in Astrophys. J. 710, 1324, 2010). This was
conjectured to be due to the region having insufficient magnetic energy to
power large events. We construct nonlinear force-free extrapolations of the
coronal magnetic field of active region AR 11029 using data taken on 24 October
by the SOLIS Vector-SpectroMagnetograph (SOLIS/VSM), and data taken on 27
October by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope SpectroPolarimeter (Hinode/SP).
Force-free modeling with photospheric magnetogram data encounters problems
because the magnetogram data are inconsistent with a force-free model, and we
employ a recently developed `self-consistency' procedure which addresses this
and accommodates uncertainties in the boundary data (Wheatland and Regnier in
Astrophys. J. 700, L88, 2009). We calculate the total energy and free energy of
the self-consistent solution and find that the free energy was 4x10^29 erg on
24 October, and 7x10^31 erg on 27 October. An order of magnitude scaling
between RHESSI non-thermal energy and GOES peak X-ray flux is established from
a sample of flares from the literature and is used to estimate flare energies
from observed GOES peak X-ray flux. Based on the scaling, we conclude that the
estimated free energy of AR 11029 on 27 October when the flaring rate peaked is
sufficient to power M-class or X-class flares, and hence the modeling does not
appear to support the hypothesis that the absence of large flares is due to the
region having limited energy.

Submitted update of Living Reviews article",,"10.12942/lrr-2013-4",,"astro-ph.SR gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Galactic globular clusters are old, dense star systems typically containing
10\super{4}--10\super{7} stars. As an old population of stars, globular
clusters contain many collapsed and degenerate objects. As a dense population
of stars, globular clusters are the scene of many interesting close dynamical
interactions between stars. These dynamical interactions can alter the
evolution of individual stars and can produce tight binary systems containing
one or two compact objects. In this review, we discuss theoretical models of
globular cluster evolution and binary evolution, techniques for simulating this
evolution that leads to relativistic binaries, and current and possible future
observational evidence for this population. Our discussion of globular cluster
evolution will focus on the processes that boost the production of hard binary
systems and the subsequent interaction of these binaries that can alter the
properties of both bodies and can lead to exotic objects. Direct {\it N}-body
integrations and Fokker--Planck simulations of the evolution of globular
clusters that incorporate tidal interactions and lead to predictions of
relativistic binary populations are also discussed. We discuss the current
observational evidence for cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, and
low-mass X-ray binaries as well as possible future detection of relativistic
binaries with gravitational radiation.

build sparsifiers, algorithms that sparsify linear systems arising from
finite-element discretizations of PDEs. In particular, we show that sampling
$O(n\log n)$ elements according to probabilities derived from effective
stiffnesses yields a high quality preconditioner that can be used to solve the
linear system in a small number of iterations. Effective stiffness generalizes
the notion of effective resistance, a key ingredient of recent progress in
developing nearly linear symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) linear solvers.
Solving finite elements problems is of considerably more interest than the
solution of SDD linear systems, since the finite element method is frequently
used to numerically solve PDEs arising in scientific and engineering
applications. Unlike SDD systems, which are relatively easy to solve, there has
been limited success in designing fast solvers for finite element systems, and
previous algorithms usually target discretization of limited class of PDEs like
scalar elliptic or 2D trusses. Our sparsifier is general; it applies to a wide
range of finite-element discretizations. A sparsifier does not constitute a
complete linear solver. To construct a solver, one needs additional components
(e.g., an efficient elimination or multilevel scheme for the sparsified
system). Still, sparsifiers have been a critical tools in efficient SDD
solvers, and we believe that our sparsifier will become a key ingredient in
future fast finite-element solvers.

fraction of the transient HMXBs are found to be Be/X-ray binaries in which the
companion Be star with its circumstellar disk governs the outburst. These
outbursts are understood to be due to the sudden enhanced mass accretion to the
neutron star and is likely to be associated with changes in the circumstellar
disk of the companion. In the recent years, another class of transient HMXBs
have been found which have supergiant companions and show shorter bursts.
X-ray, infrared and optical observations of these objects provide vital
information regarding these systems. Here we review some key observational
properties of the transient HMXBs and also discuss some important recent
developments from studies of this class of sources. The X-ray properties of
these objects are discussed in some detail whereas the optical and infrared

experiments searching for nucleon decay and neutron-antineutron oscillations.
If the baryon number violation occurs via the third generation quarks, however,
we may be able to avoid the nucleon stability constraints, thus making such BNV
interactions accessible at the LHC. In this paper we study a specific class of
BNV extensions of the standard model (SM) involving diquark and leptoquark
scalars. After an introduction to these models we study one promising extension
in detail, being interested in particles with mass of O(TeV). We calculate
limits on the masses and couplings from neutron-antineutron oscillations and
dineutron decay for couplings to first and third generation quarks. We explore
the possible consequences of such a model on the matter-antimatter asymmetry.
We shall see that for models which break the global baryon minus lepton number
symmetry, (B-L), the most stringent constraints come from the need to preserve
a matter-antimatter asymmetry. That is, the BNV interaction cannot be
introduced if it would remove the matter-antimatter asymmetry independent of
baryogenesis mechanism and temperature. Finally, we examine the phenomenology
of such models at colliders such as the LHC.

Ks)-based temperatures from the IRFM and both SDSS filter and other diagnostic
IRFM color-temperature relationships above 6000 K. For field dwarfs we find a
mean shift towards hotter temperatures relative to the KIC, of order 215 K, in
the regime where the IRFM scale is well-defined (4000 K to 6500 K). This change
is of comparable magnitude in both color systems and in spectroscopy for stars
with Teff below 6000 K. Systematic differences between temperature estimators
appear for hotter stars, and we define corrections to put the SDSS temperatures
on the IRFM scale for them. When the theoretical dependence on gravity is
accounted for we find a similar temperature scale offset between the
fundamental and KIC scales for giants. We demonstrate that statistical
corrections to color-based temperatures from binaries are significant. Typical
errors, mostly from uncertainties in extinction, are of order 100 K.

Gelfand-Tsetlin graph.
  The Young bouquet has an application to constructing infinite-dimensional

the loop level, with concrete examples at one loop. These methods originate in
the analysis of large so-called Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten shifts of tree level
amplitudes and loop level integrands. In particular BCFW shifts for particles
which are not color adjacent and some particular generalizations of this
situation are analyzed in some detail in four and higher dimensions. For
generic non-adjacent shifts our results are independent of loop order for
integrands and hold for generic minimally coupled gauge theories with possible
scalar potential and Yukawa terms. By a standard argument this result indicates
a generalization of the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations for tree level
amplitudes exists to the integrand at all loop levels. A concrete relation is
presented at one loop. Furthermore, inspired by results in QED it is shown that
the results on generalized BCFW shifts of tree level amplitudes imply relations
for the so-called rational, bubble and triangle terms of one loop amplitudes in
pure Yang-Mills theory. Bubble and triangle terms for instance are shown to
obey a five photon decoupling identity, while a three photon decoupling
identity is demonstrated for the rational terms. Along the same lines recently
conjectured relations for helicity equal amplitudes at one loop are shown to
generalize to helicity independent relations for the massive box coefficient of
the rational terms.

We place two isotropic regions, with different integral scales, inside a volume
where the turbulent kinetic energy is initially uniform and leave them to
interact and evolve in time. The different length scales produce different
decay rates in the two regions. Since the smaller-scale region decays faster, a
transient turbulent energy gradient is generated at the interface between the
two regions. The transient is characterized by three phases in which the
kinetic energy gradient across the interface grows, peaks and then slowly
decays. The transient lifetime is almost proportional to the initial ratio of
the correlation lengths. The direct numerical simulations also show that the
interface width grows in time. The velocity moments inside this interaction
zone are seen to depart from their initial isotropic values and, with a certain
lag, the anisotropy is seen to spread to small scales. The longitudinal
derivative moments also become anisotropic after a few eddy turnover times.
This anisotropic behaviour is different from that observed in sheared
homogeneous turbulent flows, where high transverse derivative moments are
generated, but longitudinal moments almost maintain the isotropic turbulence
values. Apart from the behaviour of the energy gradient transients, the results
also show the timescaling of the interface diffusion width, and data on the
anisotropy of the large and small scales, observed through one-point statistics
determined inside the intermittency sublayer, which is associated with the
interaction zone.

pion electro production to all nucleon structure functions. This framework will
allow us to split the required nucleon to pion nucleon transition probability
matrix element into an exact threshold part parametrized by nucleon to pion
nucleon transition form factors plus soft pion structures. These transition
form factors will be related to nucleon form factors by taking into account
symmetric and antisymmetric contributions of the needed leading twist nucleon
distribution amplitude. Whereas the relations generated by the symmetric
contributions are already known, this work will improve these relations by
adding reasonable antisymmetric contributions. The obtained results show
enhanced and significant consistency to experimental data, so that various
predictions for further interesting experiments will be presented.

reflectivity and transmitivity under time-reversal: $R(-k)\ne R(k)$ and $T(-k)
\ne T(k)$, unless the potentials are real or PT-symmetric. For complex
PT-symmetric scattering potentials, we propose that $R_{left}(-k)=R_{right}(k)$
and $T(-k)=T(k)$. So far, the spectral singularities (SS) of a one-dimensional
non-Hermitian scattering potential are witnessed/conjectured to be at most one.
We present a new non-Hermitian parametrization of Scarf II potential to reveal
its four new features. Firstly, it displays the just acclaimed (in)variances.
Secondly, it can support two spectral singularities at two pre-assigned real
energies ($E_*=\alpha^2,\beta^2$) either in $T(k)$ or in $T(-k)$, when
$\alpha\beta>0$. Thirdly, when $\alpha \beta <0$ it possesses one SS in $T(k)$
and the other in $T(-k)$. Fourthly, when the potential becomes PT-symmetric
$[(\alpha+\beta)=0]$, we get $T(k)=T(-k)$, it possesses a unique SS at
$E=\alpha^2$ in both $T(-k)$ and $T(k)$. Lastly, for completeness, when
$\alpha=i\gamma$ and $\beta=i\delta$, there are no SS, instead we get two
negative energies $-\gamma^2$ and $-\delta^2$ of the complex PT-symmetric Scarf
II belonging to the two well-known branches of discrete bound state eigenvalues
and no spectral singularity exists in this case. We find them as
$E^{+}_{M}=-(\gamma-M)^2$ and $E^{-}_{N}=-(\delta-N)^2$; $M(N)=0,1,2,...$ with
$0 \le M (N)< \gamma (\delta)$.

the topological information of the many-body state developing in the system

translational symmetry which allows us to separate the states in
quasi-degenerate center of mass momentum sectors. Within one center of mass
sector, the states can be further classified as eigenstates of an emergent (in
the thermodynamic limit) set of many-body relative translation operators. We
analytically establish a mapping between the two-dimensional Brillouin zone for
the Fractional Quantum Hall effect on the torus and the one for the fractional
Chern insulator. We show that the counting of quasi-degenerate levels below the
gap for the Fractional Chern Insulator should arise from a folding of the
states in the Fractional Quantum Hall system at identical filling factor. We
show how to count and separate the excitations of the Laughlin, Moore-Read and
Read-Rezayi series in the Fractional Quantum Hall effect into two-dimensional
Brillouin zone momentum sectors, and then how to map these into the momentum
sectors of the Fractional Chern Insulator. We numerically check our results by
showing the emergent symmetry at work for Laughlin, Moore-Read and Read-Rezayi
states on the checkerboard model of a Chern insulator, thereby also showing, as
a proof of principle, that non-Abelian Fractional Chern Insulators exist.

paths between pairs of nodes (the so-called small-world phenomenon); moreover,
participants are able to route messages along these paths even though each
person is only aware of a small part of the network topology. Some sociologists
conjecture that participants in such scenarios use a greedy routing strategy in
which they forward messages to acquaintances that have more categories in
common with the recipient than they do, and similar strategies have recently
been proposed for routing messages in dynamic ad-hoc networks of mobile
devices. In this paper, we introduce a network property called membership
dimension, which characterizes the cognitive load required to maintain
relationships between participants and categories in a social network. We show
that any connected network has a system of categories that will support greedy

periodic or irregular orbits, which may be easily identified in orbital
frequency space. We use the ""observed"" positions and velocities of stars as
initial conditions for orbital integrations in a variety of gravitational

check the validity of rotational mixing in massive stars, and to better
understand the effects of the ionizing flux and wind mechanical energy release
on the surrounding interstellar medium and its influence on triggered star
formation. We collect optical and UV spectra of the target stars which are
analyzed by means of atmosphere models computed with the code CMFGEN. The
spectra of binary stars are disentangled and the components are studied
separately. All stars have an evolutionary age less than 5 million years, with
the most massive stars being among the youngest. Nitrogen surface abundances
show no clear relation with projected rotational velocities. Binaries and
single stars show the same range of enrichment. This is attributed to the youth
and/or wide separation of the binary systems in which the components have not
(yet) experienced strong interaction. A clear trend of larger enrichment in
higher luminosity objects is observed, consistent with what evolutionary models
with rotation predict for a population of O stars at a given age. We confirm
the weakness of winds in late O dwarfs. In general, mass loss rates derived
from UV lines are lower than mass loss rates obtained from Ha. The UV mass loss
rates are even lower than the single line driving limit in the latest type
dwarfs. These issues are discussed in the context of the structure of massive
stars winds. The evolutionary and spectroscopic masses are in agreement above
25 Msun but the uncertainties are large. Below this threshold, the few
late-type O stars studied here indicate that the mass discrepancy still seems
to hold.

resolution optical VLT/UVES spectra. We find that both absorption systems are
composed of several narrow subcomponents with CIV/OVI Doppler-parameters b<10
km/s, typically. This implies that the gas temperatures are T<10^5 K and that
the absorbers are photoionized by the UV background. The system at z=2.1098
represents a simple, isolated OVI absorber that has only two absorption
components and that is relatively metal-rich (Z\sim 0.6 solar). Ioinization
modeling implies that the system is photoionized with OVI, CIV, and HI
coexisting in the same gas phase. The second system at z=2.1660 represents a
complicated, multi-component absorption system with eight OVI components
spanning almost 300 km/s in radial velocity. The photoionization modeling
implies that the metallicity is non-uniform and relatively low (<= 0.1 solar)
and that the OVI absorption must arise in a gas phase different from that
traced by CIV, CIII, and HI. Our detailed study of the two OVI systems towards
PKS1448-232 shows that multi-phase, multi-component high-ion absorbers like the
one at z=2.1660 require a detailed ionization modeling of the various

ice and snow for simulated planetary surfaces orbiting two observed red dwarf

The gradual reduction of the albedos of snow and ice at wavelengths greater
than 1 ?m, combined with M-stars emitting a significant fraction of their
radiation at these same longer wavelengths, mean that the albedos of ice and
snow on planets orbiting M-stars are much lower than their values on Earth. Our
results imply that the ice/snow albedo climate feedback is significantly weaker
for planets orbiting M-stars than for planets orbiting G-type stars such as the
Sun. In addition, planets with significant ice and snow cover will have
significantly higher surface temperatures for a given stellar flux if the
spectral variation of cryospheric albedo is considered, which in turn implies
that the outer edge of the habitable zone around M-stars may be 10-30% further

polarity of these materials. Two different approaches to polarization of
nitride semiconductors were assessed and the conclusions have been used to
develop models. It was shown that Berry phase formulation of the electron
related polarization component provides a number of various solutions,
different for various selection of the simulated volume. The electronic part
gives saw-like pattern for polarization. A total number of these solutions,
related to well known scaling of the geometric phase, is equal to the number of
valence electrons in the system. Summation with similar pattern for ionic part
provides several polarization values. Standard dipole density formulation
depends on the selection of the simulation volume in periodic continuous way.
Using a condition of continuous embedding into the infinite medium, and
simultaneously, the zero surface charge representation at crystal boundary
provides to physically sound solution. This solution is corresponding to
maximal and minimal polarization values and also corresponds to different
physical termination of the crystal surfaces, either bare or covered by
complementary atoms. This change leads to polarization and electric field
reversal. The polarization and related fields in finite size systems were
obtained.

an external source. These stars are thus spectacular chemical tracers of the

systems are models for debris discs around stars and the stellar discs
surrounding supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. Using a
finite-element method, we solve the linearized collisionless Boltzmann equation
and Poisson's equation for a wide range of disc masses and rms orbital
eccentricities to obtain the eigenfrequencies and shapes of normal modes. We
find that these discs can support large-scale `slow' modes, in which the
frequency is proportional to the disc mass. Slow modes are present for
arbitrarily small disc mass so long as the self-gravity of the disc is the
dominant source of apsidal precession. We find that slow modes are of two
general types: parent modes and hybrid child modes, the latter arising from
resonant interactions between parent modes and singular van Kampen modes. The
most prominent slow modes have azimuthal wavenumbers $m=1$ and $m=2$. We
illustrate how slow modes in debris discs are excited during a fly-by of a
neighbouring star. Many of the non-axisymmetric features seen in debris discs
(clumps, eccentricity, spiral waves) that are commonly attributed to planets
could instead arise from slow modes; the two hypotheses can be distinguished by
long-term measurements of the pattern speed of the features.

properties of a system consisting of a rotating black hole immersed in a
large-scale organized magnetic field. Electrically charged particles in the
immediate neighborhood of the horizon are influenced by strong gravity acting
together with magnetic and induced electric components. We relax several
constraints which were often imposed in previous works: the magnetic field does
not have to share a common symmetry axis with the spin of the black hole but
they can be inclined with respect to each other, thus violating the axial
symmetry. Also, the black hole does not have to remain at rest but it can
instead perform fast translational motion together with rotation. We
demonstrate that the generalization brings new effects. Starting from uniform
electro-vacuum fields in the curved spacetime, we find separatrices and
identify magnetic neutral points forming in certain circumstances. We suggest
that these structures can represent signatures of magnetic reconnection
triggered by frame-dragging effects in the ergosphere. We further investigate
the motion of charged particles in these black hole magnetospheres. We
concentrate on the transition from the regular motion to chaos, and in this
context we explore the characteristics of chaos in relativity. For the first
time, we apply recurrence plots as a suitable technique to quantify the degree
of chaoticness near a black hole.

divergence calculation and time slices, Stokes inversions and numerical
simulations are also employed. We characterize two mesogranular-scale exploding
granules where $\sim$ 10$^{18}$ Mx of magnetic flux emerges. The emergence of
weak unipolar longitudinal fields ($\sim$100 G) start with a single visible
magnetic polarity, occupying their respective granules' top and following the
granular splitting. After a while, mixed polarities start appearing,
concentrated in downflow lanes. The events last around 20 min. LCT analyses
confirm mesogranular scale expansion, displaying a similar pattern for all the
physical properties, and divergence centers match between all of them. We found
a similar behaviour with the emergence events in a numerical MHD simulation.
Granule expansion velocities are around 1 \kms while magnetic patches expand at
0.65 \kms. One of the analyzed events evidences the emergence of a loop-like
structure. Advection of the emerging magnetic flux features is dominated by
convective motion resulting from the exploding granule due to the magnetic
field frozen in the granular plasma. Intensification of the magnetic field
occurs in the intergranular lanes, probably because of being directed by the
downflowing plasma.

that these systems show a large range in metallicities, with -1.10<[Z/H]<0.31,
similar to the spread found at higher redshifts. These low-redshift systems on
average have subsolar metallicities, but do show a rise in metallicity over
cosmic time when compared to higher-redshift systems. We find the average
sub-DLA metallicity is higher than the average DLA metallicity at all
redshifts. Nitrogen is underabundant with respect to \alpha-group elements in
all but perhaps one of the absorbers. In some cases, [N/\alpha] is
significantly below the lowest nitrogen measurements in nearby galaxies.
Systems for which depletion patterns can be studied show little, if any,
depletion, which is characteristic of Milky Way halo-type gas. We also identify
affiliated galaxies for 3 of the sub-DLAs using spectra obtained from
Keck/LRIS. None of these sub-DLAs arise in the stellar disks of luminous
galaxies; instead, these absorbers may exist in galaxy halos at impact
parameters ranging from 38 to 92 kpc. Multiple galaxies are present near two of
the sub-DLAs, and galaxy interactions may play a role in the dispersal of the
gas. Many of these low-redshift absorbers exhibit simple kinematics, but one
sub-DLA has a complicated mix of at least 13 components spread over 150 km/s.
We find three galaxies near this sub-DLA, which also suggests that galaxy
interactions roil the gas. This study reinforces the view that DLAs have a
variety of origins, and low-redshift studies are crucial for understanding
absorber-galaxy connections.
