silicon/silicon oxide wafers to enable fast and accurate characterization by
optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Conductive silver paint and silver
wires were used to fabricate contacts; epoxy resin was employed as masking
coating in order to expose a stable, well defined area of graphene. Both
multilayer and monolayer graphene microelectrodes showed quasi-reversible
behavior during voltammetric measurements in potassium ferricyanide. However,
the standard heterogeneous charge transfer rate constant, k{\deg}, was
estimated to be higher for mono-layer graphene flakes.

interesting candidates for very high energy gamma-ray observations. The

for signals from microquasars. This paper reviews all MAGIC results of Cygnus
X-3, Cygnus X-1, Scorpius X-1, and SS 433 observations. The stand-alone MAGIC
telescope observed Cygnus X-3 for almost 60 hrs from March 2006 until August
2009 in many different X-ray spectral states where a very high energy emission
is predicted and also simultaneously with a flux enhancement at high energies
detected by Fermi/LAT. No significant signal was found in any of the observed
conditions. The MAGIC stereoscopic system pointed at the Z-type low-mass X-ray
binary Scorpius X-1 in May 2010 for ~8 hrs. Simultaneous soft X-ray
measurements allowed to define the X-ray spectral state of the source which
could emit very-high-energy photons in the horizontal branch. MAGIC did not
detect the source and put some constraints on the maximum TeV luminosity to jet
power ratio. Further observations of Cygnus X-1 were also carried out with the
new and twice as sensitive stereoscopic system in Autumn 2009 for a total

properties of a cardinal $\kappa$ cause poor behavior of some generic
ultrapowers which have critical point $\kappa$ (Burke \cite{MR1472122} when
$\kappa$ is a supercompact cardinal; Foreman-Magidor \cite{MR1359154} when
$\kappa = \omega_2$ in the presence of strong forcing axioms). We prove more
instances of this phenomenon. First, the Reflection Principle (RP) implies that
if $\vec{\mathcal{I}}$ is a tower of ideals which concentrates on the class
$GIC_{\omega_1}$ of $\omega_1$-guessing, internally club sets, then
$\vec{\mathcal{I}}$ is not presaturated (a set is $\omega_1$-guessing iff its
transitive collapse has the $\omega_1$-approximation property as defined in
Hamkins \cite{MR2540935}). This theorem, combined with work from \cite{VW_ISP},
shows that if $PFA^+$ or $MM$ holds and there is an inaccessible cardinal, then
there is a tower with critical point $\omega_2$ which is not presaturated;
moreover this tower is significantly different from the non-presaturated tower
already known (by Foreman-Magidor \cite{MR1359154}) to exist in all models of
Martin's Maximum. The conjunction of the Strong Reflection Principle (SRP) and
the Tree Property at $\omega_2$ has similar implications for towers of ideals
which concentrate on the wider class $GIS_{\omega_1}$ of $\omega_1$-guessing,
internally stationary sets.
  Finally, we show that the word ""presaturated"" cannot be replaced by
""precipitous"" in the theorems above: Martin's Maximum (which implies SRP and
the Tree Property at $\omega_2$) is consistent with a precipitous tower on
$GIC_{\omega_1}$.

physics at this epoch. At present non-Gaussianity is best constrained by the
cosmic microwave background, but in the near term large-scale structure data
may be competitive so long as the effects of primordial non-Gaussianity can be
modeled through the non-linear process of structure formation. We discuss
recent work modeling effects of a few types of primordial non-Gaussianity on
the large-scale halo clustering and the halo mass function. More specifically,
we compare analytic and N-body results for two variants of the curvaton model
of inflation: (i) a ""tauNL"" scenario in which the curvaton and inflaton
contribute equally to the primordial curvature perturbation and (ii) a ""gNL""
model where the usual quadratic fNL term in the potential cancels, but a large
cubic term remains.

(MIT) of the insulating LaAlO3 thin films observed in metal/LaAlO3/Nb-SrTiO3
heterostructures. The switching voltage depends strongly on the thickness of
the LaAlO3 thin film which indicates that a minimum thickness is required for
the MIT. A constant opposing voltage is required to deplete the charges from
the defect states. Our experimental results exclude the possibility of
diffusion of the metal electrodes or oxygen vacancies into the LaAlO3 layer.
Instead, the phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a quasi-conduction
band (QCB) in the defect states of LaAlO3 that forms a continuum state with the
conduction band of the Nb-SrTiO3. Once this continuum (metallic) state is
formed, the state remains stable even when the voltage bias is turned off. The
thickness dependent reverse switch-on voltage and the constant forward
switch-off voltage are consistent with our model. The viewpoint proposed here
can provide an alternative mechanism for resistive switching in complex oxides.

from the spin-dependent nature of the interactions in the two states since
these two states are similar except for spin. Both pi and rho are
quark-antiquark systems which can be treated using the two-body Dirac equations
(TBDE) of constraint dynamics. This relativistic approach for two-body system
has the advantage over the non-relativistic treatment in the sense that the
spin-dependent nature is automatically coming out from the formalism. We
employed Dirac's relativistic constraint dynamics to describe quark-antiquark
systems. Within this formalism, the 16-component Dirac equation is reduced to
the 4-component 2nd-order differential equation and the radial part of this
equation is simply a Schroedinger-type equation with various terms calculated
from the basic radial potential. We used a modified Richardson potential for
quark-antiquark systems which satisfies the conditions of confinement and
asymptotic freedom. We obtained the wave functions for these two mesons which
are not singular at short distances. We also found that the cancellation
between the Darwin and spin-spin interaction terms occurs in the pi mass but
not in the rho mass and this is the main source of the big difference in the
two meson masses.

general network-based mathematical model of Rift Valley fever. Given a lack of
empirical data on disease vector species and their vector competence, this
discrete time epidemic model uses stochastic parameters following several PERT
distributions to model the dynamic interactions between hosts and likely North
American mosquito vectors in dispersed geographic areas. Spatial effects and
climate factors are also addressed in the model. The model is applied to a
large directed asymmetric network of 3,621 nodes based on actual farms to
examine a hypothetical introduction to some counties of Texas, an important
ranching area in the United States of America (U.S.A.). The nodes of the
networks represent livestock farms, livestock markets, and feedlots, and the

different contact networks to assess virus propagation. Rift Valley fever virus
spread is assessed under various initial infection conditions (infected
mosquito eggs, adults or cattle). A surprising trend is fewer initial
infectious organisms result in a longer delay before a larger and more

the infections expands geographically before becoming an epidemic involving
many dispersed farms and animals almost simultaneously.

that a formula is provable if and only if its embedding into minimal logic,
mFOL, is uniformly valid under the Brouwer Heyting Kolmogorov (BHK) semantics,
the intended semantics of iFOL and mFOL. Our proof is intuitionistic and
provides an effective procedure Prf that converts uniform minimal evidence into
a formal first-order proof. We have implemented Prf. Uniform validity is
defined using the intersection operator as a universal quantifier over the
domain of discourse and atomic predicates. Formulas of iFOL that are uniformly
valid are also intuitionistically valid, but not conversely. Our strongest
result requires the Fan Theorem; it can also be proved classically by showing
that Prf terminates using Konig's Theorem.
  The fundamental idea behind our completeness theorem is that a single
evidence term evd witnesses the uniform validity of a minimal logic formula F.
Finding even one uniform realizer guarantees intuitionistic validity because
Prf(F, evd) builds a first-order proof of F, establishing its intuitionistic
validity and providing a purely logical normalized realizer.
  We establish completeness for iFOL as follows. Friedman showed that iFOL can
be embedded in minimal logic (mFOL) by his A-transformation, mapping formula F
to FA. If F is uniformly valid, then so is FA, and by our completeness theorem,
we can find a proof of FA in minimal logic. Then we intuitionistically prove F
from FFalse, i.e. by taking False for A and for \bot of mFOL. Our result
resolves an open question posed by Beth in 1947.

estimate of the time-delayed mutual information for a time-series is proposed.
In particular, the bias of the time-delayed mutual information is shown to
often be equivalent to the mutual information between two distributions of
points from the same system separated by infinite time. Thus intuitively,
estimation of the bias is reduced to estimation of the mutual information
between distributions of data points separated by large time intervals. The
proposed bias estimation techniques are shown to work for Lorenz equations data
and glucose time series data of three patients from the Columbia University

manage memory efficiently. As compute engines grow larger, AMR simulations will
require algorithms that achieve new levels of efficient parallelization and
memory management. We have attempted to employ new techniques to achieve both
of these goals. Patch or grid based AMR often employs ghost cells to decouple
the hyperbolic advances of each grid on a given refinement level. This
decoupling allows each grid to be advanced independently. In AstroBEAR we
utilize this independence by threading the grid advances on each level with
preference going to the finer level grids. This allows for global load
balancing instead of level by level load balancing and allows for greater
parallelization across both physical space and AMR level. Threading of level
advances can also improve performance by interleaving communication with
computation, especially in deep simulations with many levels of refinement. To
improve memory management we have employed a distributed tree algorithm that
requires processors to only store and communicate local sections of the AMR
tree structure with neighboring processors.

spin polarization, and {rho} is the resistivity of the semiconductor transport

those predicted by theory, rather than in good agreement as we stated. We
emphasize that the basic conclusions of our paper are the same - the systematic
decrease in electron spin lifetime with increasing electron density
demonstrates spin accumulation in the Si channel rather than in interface
states. We further show that the measured spin lifetimes are essentially
independent of the tunnel barrier material (SiO2, Al2O3, MgO) or the magnetic

Rautian [Sov. Phys. JETP 85, 451 (1997)]. These references consider a metal
nanoparticle as a degenerate Fermi gas of conduction electrons in an
infinitely-high spherical potential well. This model (referred to as the HRFR
model below) yields mathematical expressions for the linear and the third-order
nonlinear polarizabilities of a nanoparticle in terms of infinite nested
series. These series have not been evaluated numerically so far and, in the
case of nonlinear polarizability, they can not be evaluated with the use of
conventional computers due to the high computational complexity involved.
Rautian has derived a set of remarkable analytical approximations to the series
but direct numerical verification of Rautian's approximate formulas remained a
formidable challenge. In this work, we derive an expression for the third-order
nonlinear polarizability, which is exact within the HRFR model but amenable to
numerical implementation. We then evaluate the expressions obtained by us
numerically for both linear and nonlinear polarizabilities. We investigate the
limits of applicability of Rautian's approximations and find that they are
surprizingly accurate in a wide range of physical parameters. We also discuss
the limits of small frequencies (comparable or below the Drude relaxation
constant) and of large particle sizes (the bulk limit) and show that these

viability of a recently advocated strong metallicity dependence was evaluated
by applying the proposed correction (gamma=-0.8 mag/dex) to distances
established for the Magellanic Clouds via a Galactic VIc Wesenheit calibration,
which is anchored to ten nearby classical Cepheids with measured HST
parallaxes. The resulting gamma-corrected distances for the Magellanic Clouds
(e.g., SMC, mu(0,gamma)~18.3) are in significant disagreement with that
established from a mean of >300 published estimates (NED-D), and a universal
Wesenheit template featuring eleven delta Scuti, SX Phe, RR Lyrae, and Type II
Cepheid variables with HST/Hipparcos parallaxes. Conversely, adopting a null
correction (i.e., gamma=0 mag/dex) consolidates the estimates. In tandem with
existing evidence, the results imply that variations in chemical composition
among Cepheids are a comparatively negligible source of uncertainty for
W(VIc)-based extragalactic distances and determinations of H_0. A new approach
is described which aims to provide additional Galactic Cepheid calibrators to
facilitate subsequent assessments of the VIc Wesenheit function's relative
(in)sensitivity to abundance changes. VVV/UKIDSS/2MASS JHKs photometry for
clusters in spiral arms shall be employed to establish a precise galactic
longitude-distance relation, which can be applied in certain cases to determine

time analysis pipeline, we spectroscopically confirmed twenty-three cluster SN
Ia, four of which were intracluster events. Using our deep CFHT/Megacam
imaging, we measured total stellar luminosities in each of our galaxy clusters,
and we performed detailed supernova detection efficiency simulations. Bringing
these ingredients together, we measure an overall cluster SN Ia rate within
R_{200} (1 Mpc) of 0.042^{+0.012}_{-0.010}^{+0.010}_{-0.008} SNuM

(0.041^{+0.019}_{-0.015}^{+0.005}_{-0.004} SNuM). The red sequence SN Ia rate
is consistent with published rates in early type/elliptical galaxies in the
`field'. Using our red sequence SN Ia rate, and other cluster SNe measurements
in early type galaxies up to $z\sim1$, we derive the late time (>2 Gyr) delay
time distribution (DTD) of SN Ia assuming a cluster early type galaxy star
formation epoch of z_f=3. Assuming a power law form for the DTD, \Psi(t)\propto
t^s, we find s=-1.62\pm0.54. This result is consistent with predictions for the
double degenerate SN Ia progenitor scenario (s\sim-1), and is also in line with
recent calculations for the double detonation explosion mechanism (s\sim-2).
The most recent calculations of the single degenerate scenario delay time
distribution predicts an order of magnitude drop off in SN Ia rate \sim 6-7 Gyr
after stellar formation, and the observed cluster rates cannot rule this out.

covering the range 0.1-100 Msun. It is to be expected that the masses of the
ensuing compact remnants correlate with the masses of their progenitor stars,
and thus it is generally thought that the remnant masses should be smoothly
distributed from the lightest white dwarfs to the heaviest black holes.
However, this intuitive prediction is not borne out by observed data. In the
rapidly growing population of remnants with observationally determined masses,
a striking mass gap has emerged at the boundary between neutron stars and black
holes. The heaviest neutron stars reach a maximum of two solar masses, while
the lightest black holes are at least five solar masses. Over a decade after
the discovery, the gap has become a significant challenge to our understanding
of compact object formation. We offer new insights into the physical processes
that bifurcate the formation of remnants into lower mass neutron stars and
heavier black holes. Combining the results of stellar modeling with
hydrodynamic simulations of supernovae, we both explain the existence of the
gap, and also put stringent constraints on the inner workings of the supernova
explosion mechanism. In particular, we show that core-collapse supernovae are
launched within 100-200 milliseconds of the initial stellar collapse, implying
that the explosions are driven by instabilities with a rapid (10-20 ms) growth
time. Alternatively, if future observations fill in the gap, this will be an
indication that these instabilities develop over a longer (>200 milliseconds)
timescale.

structures of spacetimes in the HL theory in general are different from those
given in GR, because the dispersion relations of test particles now contain
high-order momentum terms, so the speeds of these particles are unbounded in
the ultraviolet (UV). As a result, the conception of light-cones defined in GR
becomes invalid and test particles do not follow geodesics. To study black
holes in the HL theory, we adopt the geometrical optical approximations, and
define a horizon as a (two-closed) surface that is free of spacetime
singularities and on which massless test particles are infinitely redshifted.
With such a definition, we show that some of our solutions give rise to
(charged) black holes, although the radii of their horizons in general depend
on the energies of the test particles.

using deep infrared Wide Field Camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame optical
structure of 935 host galaxies selected with 0.4<z<2.5 and stellar masses M* >
10^10.7 Msol using optical and near-infrared photometry in the UKIRT Ultra Deep
Survey and GOODS-South fields of the CANDELS survey. At each redshift, the most
compact sources are those with little or no star formation, and we find that
the mean size of these systems grows by a factor of 3.5 +- 0.3 over this
redshift interval. The new data are sufficiently deep to enable us to identify
companions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller, while
still yielding suitably accurate photometric redshifts to define a likely
physical association. By searching for faint companions around 404 quiescent
hosts within a projected physical annulus 10 < R < 30 kpc/h, we estimate the
minor merger rate over the redshift range 0.4 < z < 2. After correcting for
contamination from projected pairs, we find that 13-18% of quiescent hosts have
likely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. Mergers
of these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6+-2% per merger
timescale. We estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain the
declining abundance of compact galaxies. Using a simple model of merging
motivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers of
the faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimal
rate. We find that mergers with mass ratios > 0.1 may explain most of the size
evolution observed at z >~ 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed,
but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additional
physical processes.

excitation of extreme orbital eccentricity (e=0.99 or even larger) followed by
tidal dissipation at periastron passage that eventually circularizes the
planetary orbit at a period less than 10 days. In a steady state, this
mechanism requires the existence of a significant population of super-eccentric
(e>0.9) migrating Jupiters with long orbital periods and periastron distances
of only a few stellar radii. For these super-eccentric planets, the periastron
is fixed due to conservation of orbital angular momentum and the energy
dissipated per orbit is constant, implying that the rate of change in
semi-major axis a is \dot a \propto a^0.5 and consequently the number
distribution satisfies dN/dlog a\propto a^0.5. If this formation process
produces most hot Jupiters, Kepler should detect several super-eccentric

many-body physics of a large system arising from the coupling among a series of
small identical systems whose few-body dynamics is exactly solvable. Using
Landau-Zener (LZ) transition of bosonic atoms in double well optical lattices
as an experimentally realizable model, we investigate such few to many body
route by exploring the relation and difference between the small few-body (in
one double well) and the large many-body (in double well lattice)
non-equilibrium dynamics of cold atoms in optical lattices. We find the
many-body coupling between double wells greatly enhances the LZ transition
probability. The many-body dynamics in the double well lattice shares both
similarity and difference from the few-body dynamics in one and two double
wells. The sign of the on-site interaction plays a significant role on the
many-body LZ transition. Various experimental signatures of the many-body LZ
transition, including atom density, momentum distribution, and density-density
correlation, are obtained.

fluctuation, and the interface propagates by molecular filling of thin layers
in the transverse direction. The structure of the nucleation sites is
determined. The inherent instability and irreproducibility of the kinetics in
question is revealed. A linear kinetics, as opposed to the bulk kinetics, is
introduced and shown to be in accord with the contact mechanism. Ferromagnetic
phase transition and magnetization are added to the list of solid-state
reactions; neither occurs without structural rearrangement.

frustrated system that undergoes a first order structural transition at its
antiferromagnetic ordering temperature. CuCr2O4 is tetragonal at room
temperature as a result of Jahn-Teller active tetrahedral Cu^2+ and undergoes a
magnetic transition at 135 K. Substitution of magnetic cations for diamagnetic
Mg^2+ on the tetrahedral A site in the compositional series Mg(1-x)Cu(x)Cr2O4
dramatically affects magnetic behavior. In the composition range 0 < x < 0.3,
the compounds are antiferromagnetic. A sharp peak observed at 12.5K in the heat
capacity of MgCr2O4 corresponding to a magnetically driven first order
structural transition is suppressed even for small x suggesting glassy
disorder. Uncompensated magnetism - with open magnetization loops - develops

(NMF) methods for blind source separation of degenerate data. The motivation
originates from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where a multiple
mixture NMR spectra are recorded to identify chemical compounds with similar
structures. Consider the linear mixing model (LMM), we aim to identify the
chemical compounds involved when the mixing process is known to be nearly
singular. We first consider a class of data with dominant interval(s) (DI)
where each of source signals has dominant peaks over others. Besides, a nearly
singular mixing process produces degenerate mixtures. The DI condition implies
clustering structures in the data points. Hence, the estimation of the mixing
matrix could be achieved by data clustering. Due to the presence of the noise
and the degeneracy of the data, a small deviation in the estimation may
introduce errors in the output. To resolve this problem and improve robustness
of the separation, methods are developed in two aspects. One is to find better
estimation of the mixing matrix by allowing a constrained perturbation to the
clustering output, and it can be achieved by a quadratic programming. The other
is to seek sparse source signals by exploiting the DI condition, and it solves
an $\ell_1$ optimization. If no source information is available, we propose to
adopt the nonnegative matrix factorization approach by incorporating the matrix
structure (parallel columns of the mixing matrix) into the cost function and
develop multiplicative iteration rules for the numerical solutions. We present
experimental results of NMR data to show the performance and reliability of the
method in the applications arising in NMR spectroscopy.

simple modules, as recently introduced by T. Aihara. These mutations are
defined as the endomorphism rings of certain tilting complexes of length 1.
Starting from a weakly symmetric algebra A, presented by a quiver with
relations, we give a detailed description of the quiver and relations of the
algebra obtained by mutating at a single loopless vertex of the quiver of A. In
this form the mutation procedure appears similar to, although significantly
more complicated than, the mutation procedure of Derksen, Weyman and Zelevinsky
for quivers with potentials. By definition, weakly symmetric algebras connected
by a sequence of tilting mutations are derived equivalent, and hence stably
equivalent. The second aim of this article is to study these stable
equivalences via a result of Okuyama describing the images of the simple
modules. As an application we answer a question of Asashiba on the derived
Picard groups of a class of self-injective algebras of finite representation
type. We conclude by introducing a mutation procedure for maximal systems of
orthogonal bricks in a triangulated category, which is motivated by the effect
that a tilting mutation has on the set of simple modules in the stable
category.

to FCS monomers (radial bonds), and the bonds linking two FCS monomers (shell

Adiabatic simulations that account for the absorption of X-rays from an assumed
point source at the apex of the wind-collision shock cone by the distorted
winds can closely match the observed 2-10keV RXTE light curves of both \eta\
Car and WR140. This point-source model can also explain the early recovery of
\eta\ Car's X-ray light curve from the 2009.0 minimum by a factor of 2-4
reduction in the mass loss rate of \eta\ Car. Our more recent models relax the
point-source approximation and account for the spatially extended emission
along the wind-wind interaction shock front. For WR140, the computed X-ray
light curve again matches the RXTE observations quite well. But for \eta\ Car,
a hot, post-periastron bubble leads to an emission level that does not match

response time) and analysing them will affect on designing an adaptive DSMS. In
this paper, effective parameters on response time of DSMS are studied and
analysed and a solution is proposed for DSMSs' adaptivity. The proposed
adaptive DSMS architecture includes a learning unit that frequently evaluates
system to adjust the optimal value for each of tuneable effective. Learning
Automata is used as the learning mechanism of the learning unit to adjust the
value of tuneable effective parameters. So, when system faces some changes, the
learning unit increases performance by tuning each of tuneable effective
parameters to its optimum value. Evaluation results illustrate that after a
while, parameters reach their optimum value and then DSMS's adaptivity will be
improved considerably.

solve the problem of communication over an insecure channel. With advanced
technologies in computer hardware and software, these standards seem not to be
as secure and fast as one would like. In this paper we propose a encryption
technique which provides security to both the message and the secret key
achieving confidentiality and authentication. The Symmetric algorithm used has
two advantages over traditional schemes. First, the encryption and decryption
procedures are much simpler, and consequently, much faster. Second, the
security level is higher due to the inherent poly-alphabetic nature of the
substitution mapping method used here, together with the translation and
transposition operations performed in the algorithm. Asymmetric algorithm RSA
is worldwide known for its high security. In this paper a detailed report of
the process is presented and analysis is done comparing our proposed technique

distribution, with one assumption between the static and hydrodynamic radii,
the calculated and measured data of DLS are consistent very well at all the

Traditionally, the particle information: apparent hydrodynamic radius and

intensity-intensity autocorrelation function from an exponent function. Since
the apparent hydrodynamic radius obtained using the Stokes-Einstein relation is
an optical weighted average radius, it is an approximate value of mean
hydrodynamic radius. And the polydispersity index is not relate to the width of
hydrodynamic radius. Therefore the apparent hydrodynamic radius and

harbour Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLO) detected by Spitzer Space Telescope
and to confirm their VeLLO nature. The cloud distances are estimated using
near-IR photometric method. We use a technique that provides spectral
classification of stars lying towards the fields containing the clouds into
main sequence and giants. In this technique, the observed (J-H) and (H-Ks)
colours are dereddened simultaneously using trial values of A_V and a normal
interstellar extinction law. The best fit of the dereddened colours to the
intrinsic colours giving a minimum value of chi^{2} then yields the
corresponding spectral type and A_V for the star. The main sequence stars, thus
classified, are then utilized in an A_V versus distance plot to bracket the
cloud distances. The typical error in the estimation of distances to the clouds
are found to be ~18%.We estimated distances to seven cloud cores, IRAM04191,
L1521F, BHR111, L328, L673-7, L1014, and L1148 using the above method. These
clouds contain VeLLO candidates. The estimated distances to the cores are found
to be 127\pm25 pc (IRAM04191), 136\pm36 pc (L1521F), 355\pm65 pc (BHR111),

these seven clouds using the distances estimated from this work. Except for
L1014-IRS (L_{int}=0.15 L_{\odot}), all other VeLLO candidates are found to be
consistent with the definition of a VeLLO (L_{int}<=0.1L_{\odot}). In addition
to the cores that harbour VeLLO candidates, we also obtained distances to the

in mammalian cells as well as carcinogenesis. However, there are controversial
issues about their role in cancer pathogenesis. This study was designed to
evaluate genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of Carbenoxolone (CBX) as a prototype of
inter-cellular gap junction blocker in MCF7 and BT20 human breast cancer cells.
Methods: The MCF7and BT20 human breast cancer cell lines were cultivated, and
treated at designated confluency with different doses of CBX. Cellular
cytotoxicity was examined using standard colorimetric assay associated with
cell viability tests. Gene expression evaluation was carried out using real
time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: MCF7 and BT20 cells were
significantly affected by CBX in a dose dependent manner in cell viability
assays. Despite varying expression of genes, down regulation of pro- and
anti-apoptotic genes was observed in these cells. Conclusion: Based upon this
investigation, it can be concluded that CBX could affect both low and high
proliferative types of breast cancer cell lines and disproportionate down
regulation of both pre- and anti-apoptotic genes may be related to interacting
biomolecules, perhaps via gap junctions.

(>= 71%) and low rate of contamination provides a strong vindication of the
photometric redshift analysis used to define the original sample. By
considering star-formation rate estimates based on the Ly_alpha and UV
continuum luminosity we conclude that our sample is consistent with a Ly_alpha
escape fraction of ~25%. Moreover, after careful consideration of the potential
uncertainties and biases, we find that 40%-50% of our sample of L >= 2L*
galaxies at 6.0<z<6.5 display strong Ly_alpha emission (rest-frame equivalent
width >= 25 Angs), a fraction which is a factor of ~2 higher than previously
reported for L <= L* galaxies at z~6. Our results suggest that, as the epoch of
reionization is approached, it is plausible that the Ly_alpha emitter fraction
amongst luminous (L >=2 L*) LBGs shows a similarly sharp increase to that
observed in their lower-luminosity (L <= L*) counterparts.

the potential threats of the world vegetables trade network (VTN) in spreading
fatal infectious diseases. The heterogeneous weight distribution and
multi-scale activity of intermediary networks affects the diffusion,
proliferation and extinction of epidemics. Here, we constructed a dual-weighted
VTN with 118 major countries and territories from FAO 2008 statistic data about
global vegetation production and trade, and develop a reaction-diffusion model
to simulate the epidemic behaviors in through VTN. We found an emerged
asymmetric threshold of epidemic on VTN, in which local proliferation within
nodes plays a more critical role than global diffusion in spreading of
EHEC-like diseases, i.e. sufficient local proliferation is the precondition for
global diffusion. We also found that a strong modularity on VTN structure,
which restricts the spreading of EHEC-like diseases; however, within the
communities, the diffusion is quick and easy. There is, moreover, a critical
""epidemic stem"", in which a serial of positive feedback loop for amplifying the
proliferation and diffusion pathogens has been identified from entire VTN.
Surprisingly, statistical analysis shows a well consistency between theoretical
composition of stem and actual pattern of EHEC. The results provide a chance to
design gradient control strategies for controlling disease global diffusion.
Our analysis provided the first inspect of global epidemics mediated by trade
networks for improved control and immunity strategies in the future.

A technique using factorial moments defined on a sequence of returns is

from a fundamental point of view, there is no clear reason why DAX and Euro

factors interact at each instant to determine the transaction price. These
factors are certainly different for an index on a change parity (Euro) and an

advantage of micro-structure analysis to prompt unified approaches of different

computing services economically, it is important to optimize resource
allocation under the assumption that the required resource can be taken from a
shared resource pool. In addition, to be able to provide processing ability and
storage capacity, it is necessary to allocate bandwidth to access them at the

  This paper proposes an optimal resource allocation method for cloud computing
environments. First, this paper develops a resource allocation model of cloud
computing environments, assuming both processing ability and bandwidth are
allocated simultaneously to each service request and rented out on an hourly
basis. The allocated resources are dedicated to each service request. Next,
this paper proposes an optimal joint multiple resource allocation method, based
on the above resource allocation model. It is demonstrated by simulation
evaluation that the proposed method can reduce the request loss probability and
as a result, reduce the total resource required, compared with the conventional
allocation method. Then, this paper defines basic principles and a measure for
achieving fair resource allocation among multiple users in a cloud computing
environment, and proposes a fair joint multiple resource allocation method. It
is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposed method enables the
fair resource allocation among multiple users without a large decline in

important role during phase transformations not only of amorphous boron, but
also of crystalline forms. We have observed the crystallization of tetragonal
boron T-B52 from amorphous phase of high purity (99.99%), which, however,
cannot be easily distinguished from B50C2 boron compound. Many factors
influence the transformations of amorphous phase, and it is possible to observe
not only well known am-B \rightarrow {\alpha}-B12 and am-B \rightarrow
{\beta}-B106 transformations, but also am-B \rightarrow T-B52, never reported
so far. At ~14 GPa the crystallization order becomes {\beta}-B106 \rightarrow
{\alpha}-B12 \rightarrow {\gamma}-B28, while at ~11 GPa the intermediate
crystallization of T-B52 still was observed. This unambiguously indicates that
{\alpha}-B12 is more thermodynamically stable than {\beta}-B106 at high

rules for interaction, or lack of interaction, among members of a flock or,
more generally, any community. Using experimental field measurements of homing
pigeons in flight we demonstrate the existence of a basic distance dependent
attraction/repulsion relationship and show that this rule is sufficient to
explain collective behavior observed in nature. Positional data of individuals
over time are used as input data to a computational algorithm capable of
building complex nonlinear functions that can represent the system behavior.
Topological nearest neighbor interactions are considered to characterize the
components within this model. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated with
simulated noisy data generated from the classical (two dimensional) Vicsek
model. When applied to experimental data from homing pigeon flights we show
that the more complex three dimensional models are capable of predicting and
simulating trajectories, as well as exhibiting realistic collective dynamics.
The simulations of the reconstructed models are used to extract properties of
the collective behavior in pigeons, and how it is affected by changing the
initial conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate that this approach
may be applied to construct models capable of simulating trajectories and
collective dynamics using experimental field measurements of herd movement.

each j in {1,2,...,n} can be written as j=x+y, x,y in A, x<=y. If we pick each
integer in {0,1,...,n} independently with probability p=p_n tending to 0, thus
getting a random set A, what is the probability that we have obtained a
2-additive basis? We address this question when the target sum-set is
[(1-alpha)n,(1+alpha)n] (or equivalently [alpha n, (2-alpha) n]) for some
0<alpha<1. Under either model, the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation
is used, in conjunction with Janson's inequalities, to tease out a very sharp
threshold for the emergence of a 2-additive basis. Generalizations to
k-additive bases are then given.

deg near the Galactic center in the 9 um band. The band intensity is mostly
attributed to the aromatic hydrocarbon infrared emissions of carbonaceous
grains at wavelengths of 6.2, 7,7, 8.6, and 11.3 um. We detect the 9 um
emission structures extending from the Galactic plane up to the latitude of
about 2.5 deg, which have spatial correspondence to the molecular loops
revealed by the NANTEN 12CO (J=1-0) observations. We find that the surface
brightness at 9 um is suppressed near the foot points of the CO loops. The
ratios of the 9 um to the IRAS 100 um brightness show significant depression
near such bright regions in the CO emission. With the AKARI near-IR 2.5--5 um
spectroscopy, we find that the 3.3 um aromatic hydrocarbon emission is absent
in the region associated with the loop. These suggest the processing and
destruction of carbonaceous grains in the CO molecular loops.

well-known three characteristic class transformations of singular varieties:
MacPherson's Chern class, Baum-Fulton-MacPherson's Todd class and the L-class

bivariant relative Grothendieck group K_0(V/-) and in the algebraic context (in
any characteristic) two Grothendieck transformations mC_y resp. T_y defined on
K_0(V/-). Evaluating at y=0, we get a motivic lift T_0 of Fulton-MacPherson's
bivariant Riemann-Roch transformation. The associated covariant transformations
agree for k of characteristic zero with our motivic Chern- and Hirzebruch class
transformations defined on K_0(V/X). Finally, evaluating at y=-1, we get for k
