relaxation time approach using an isospin- and momentum-dependent interaction
and the nucleon-nucleon cross sections taken as those from the experimental
data modified by the in-medium effective masses as used in the IBUU transport
model calculations. The relaxation time of neutrons is larger while that of
protons is smaller in neutron-rich nuclear matter compared with that in
symmetric nuclear matter, and this leads to a larger specific viscosity in
neutron-rich nuclear matter. In addition, the specific viscosity decreases with
increasing temperature because of more frequent collisions and weaker Pauli
blocking effect at higher temperatures. At lower temperatures the specific
viscosity increases with increasing density due to the Pauli blocking effect,
while at higher temperatures it slightly decreases with increasing density as a
result of smaller in-medium effective masses at higher densities.

  curved space","21 pages; discussion of three-dimensional quantum mechanics added,
  error in quantum commutators corrected",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Snyder-de Sitter (SdS) model is a generalization of the Snyder model to a
spacetime background of constant curvature. It is an example of noncommutative
spacetime admitting two fundamental scales besides the speed of light, and is
invariant under the action of the de Sitter group. Here we consider its
nonrelativistic counterpart, i.e. the Snyder model restricted to a
three-dimensional sphere, and the related model obtained by considering the
anti-Snyder model on a pseudosphere, that we call anti-Snyder-de Sitter (aSdS).
  By means of a nonlinear transformation relating the SdS phase space variables
to canonical ones, we are able to investigate the classical and the quantum
mechanics of a free particle and of an oscillator in this framework. As in
their flat space limit, the SdS and aSdS models exhibit rather different
properties. In the SdS case, a lower bound on the localization in position and
momentum space arises, which is not present in the aSdS model. In the aSdS
case, instead, a specific combination of position and momentum coordinates
cannot exceed a constant value.
  We explicitly solve the classical and the quantum equations for the motion of
the free particle and of the harmonic oscillator. In both the SdS and aSdS
cases, the frequency of the harmonic oscillator acquires a dependence on the
energy.

coming from such a sensitive locality (Keratea, Greece) reveals, through
complex impedance spectroscopy, that the activation volume for relaxation of
this rock is negative which so far has been reported only rarely. This result,
however, supports a theoretical model on the pre-seismic electric signals and
is likely to be correlated with the sensitivity of the site and hence with the

evolution of a massive star of 25 M\odot are investigated for the first time.
Although the s-process in massive stars has been believed to be established
with only minor change, we find that the s-process with use of the new rate
during the core He-burning is very inefficient compared to the case with the
previous triple-{\alpha} rate. However, the difference of the overproduction is
found to be largely compensated by the subsequent C-burning. Since the
s-process in massive stars has been attributed so far to the neutron
irradiation during core He-burning, our finding reveals the importance of
C-burning for the s-process during the evolution of massive stars.

to provide different ways to measure the complexity of the schemas. In this

frequency band 50-800 Hz and with the frequency time derivative in the range of
0 through -6e-9 Hz/s. Such a signal could be produced by a nearby spinning and
slightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our galaxy. After recent
improvements in the search program that yielded a 10x increase in computational
efficiency, we have searched in two years of data collected during LIGO's fifth
science run and have obtained the most sensitive all-sky upper limits on
gravitational wave strain to date. Near 150 Hz our upper limit on worst-case
linearly polarized strain amplitude $h_0$ is 1e-24, while at the high end of
our frequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of 3.8e-24 for all
polarizations and sky locations. These results constitute a factor of two
improvement upon previously published data. A new detection pipeline utilizing
a Loosely Coherent algorithm was able to follow up weaker outliers, increasing
the volume of space where signals can be detected by a factor of 10, but has
not revealed any gravitational wave signals. The pipeline has been tested for
robustness with respect to deviations from the model of an isolated neutron
star, such as caused by a low-mass or long-period binary companion.

CTRWs generalize the usual random walk model by allowing random waiting times
between successive random jumps. Under certain conditions on the jumps and
waiting times, scaled CTRWs can be shown to converge in distribution to a limit
process M(t) in the cadlag space D[0,infinity) with the Skorohod J_1 or M_1

swapping of two multipartite boxes, and then generate a multipartite box with
more users than that of any of the boxes before swapping. Here quantum bound
still appears in the scheme. The bipartite coupler also can be applied to a
hybrid scheme of generating a multipartite extremal box from many PR boxes. As
the analogue of multipartite entanglement swapping, we generalize the
nonlocality swapping of bipartite binary boxes to multipartite binary boxes by
using a multipartite coupler $\chi_{N}$, and get the probability of success by
connecting the coupler to the generalized Svetlichny inequality. The
multipartite coupler acting on many multipartite boxes makes multipartite
nonlocality swapping be a more efficient device to manipulate nonlocality
between many users. The results show that Tsirelson's bound for quantum
nonlocality emerges only when two of the $n$ boxes involved in the coupler

physical or chemical pressure) is supposed to be responsible for transition of
Cu- and Fe-based HTSC to new ground state common for both HTSC classes where
specific mechanism of superconductivity takes place. The resulting HTSC ground
state is strongly correlated insulator with not fully filled exciton-electronic
band, where the incoherent electron transport is impossible but coherent
superconducting transport is possible because the band is not fully occupied.
It is shown also that such electronic system is inherently predisposed to
superconductive pairing because each pair of nearest cations acts as a two-atom
negative-U center. The nature of Fermi arcs and mechanism of pseudogap are
considered. It is shown that both of these features result from d-wave pairing
and therefore have to be observed only in cuprates. We believe that the
considered ground state is common for various families of HTSCs including
cuprates, pnictides, selenides, bismutates and probably some other.

classified for the vertex operator superalgebra automorphisms which are lifts
of a finite automorphism of the N=2 Neveu-Schwarz Lie superalgebra
representation. These include the Ramond-twisted sectors and mirror-twisted
sectors for N=2 vertex operator superalgebras, as well as twisted modules
related to more general ""spectral flow"" representations of the N=2
Neveu-Schwarz algebra. We present the construct of twisted modules for free N=2
vertex operator superalgebras for all of the N=2 Neveu-Schwarz Lie superalgebra
automorphisms of finite order. We show how to extend these to lattice N=2
vertex operator superalgebras. As a consequence, we also construct the
Ramond-twisted sectors for free and lattice N=1 supersymmetric vertex operator
superalgebras. We show that the lifting of the mirror automorphism for the N=2
Neveu-Schwarz algebra to an N=2 vertex operator superalgebra is not unique and
that different mirror map vertex operator superalgebra automorphisms of an N=2
vertex operator superalgebra can lead to non-isomorphic categories of
mirror-twisted modules, as in the case of free and lattice N=2 vertex operator
superalgebras.

give a full description of the cohomology, after restricting to integral Hecke
operators at p on the automorphic side. We allow arbitrary ramification at p;
even the PEL data may be ramified. This gives a description of the semisimple
local Hasse-Weil zeta function in these cases. We also treat cases of
nontrivial endoscopy. For this purpose, we give a general stabilization of the
expression given in previous work, following the stabilization given by
Kottwitz. This introduces endoscopic transfers of the functions $\phi_{\tau,h}$
which were introduced in previous work via deformation spaces of $p$-divisible
groups. We state a general conjecture relating these endoscopic transfers with
Langlands parameters. We verify this conjecture in all cases of EL type, and
deduce new results about the endoscopic part of the cohomology of Shimura
varieties. This allows us to simplify the construction of Galois

quadrupole lines on the recombination of hydrogen. Although the physics of all
the considered processes is interesting and subtle, for the standard cosmology,
with Y_p \sim 0.24, the overall correction to the ionization history during
helium recombination with respect to the previous implementation of CosmoRec
remains smaller than |DeltaNe/Ne| \sim 0.05%. The dominant improvement is
caused by consistent inclusion of resonance scattering for the 2^1 P_1 - 1^1
S_0 resonance. For cosmologies with a large helium fraction, Y_p \sim 0.4, the
difference reaches |D N_e/N_e|\sim 0.22% at z\sim1800, however, the overall
correction to the CMB power spectra is small, exceeding |D C_l/C_l| \sim 0.05 %

effective moment is equal to the Cr^3+ spin-only S = 3/2 value throughout the
entire solid solution. Theta is negative, indicating that the dominant
interactions are antiferromagnetic, and its magnitude increases with Cr
substitution. For dilute Cr compositions, J_BB was estimated by mean-field
theory to be 2.0 meV. Despite the sizable Theta, long-range antiferromagnetic
order does not develop until very large x, and is preceeded by glassy behavior.
Data presented here, and that on dilute Al-substitution from Okuda et al.,
suggest that the reduction in magnetic frustration due to the presence of
non-magnetic Al does not have as dominant an effect on magnetism as chemical
disorder and dilution of the magnetic exchange. For all samples, the 5 K
isothermal magnetization does not saturate in fields up to 5 T and minimal
hysteresis is observed. The presence of antiferromagnetic interactions is
clearly evident in the sub-Brillouin behavior with a reduced magnetization per
Cr atom. An inspection of the scaled Curie plot reveals that significant
short-range antiferromagnetic interactions occur in CuCrO2 above its Neel
temperature, consistent with its magnetic frustration. Uncompensated
short-range interactions are present in the Al-substituted samples and are
likely a result of chemical disorder.

the conjecture of up-down symmetry of Grinstein and colleagues (1985) is
studied and generalized. This model is well-known, today, as Majority-Vote
Model. They showed, through Monte Carlo simulations, that their obtained
results fall into the universality class of the equilibrium Ising model on a
square lattice. In this work, we generalize the Majority-Vote Model for a
version with three states, now including the zero state, ($-1,0,+1$) in two
dimensions. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we showed that our model falls into
the universality class of the spin-1 ($-1,0,+1$) and spin-1/2 Ising model and
also agree with Majority-Vote Model proposed for M.J. Oliveira (1992) . The
exponents ratio obtained for our model was $\gamma/\nu =1.77(3)$,
$\beta/\nu=0.121(5)$, and $1/\nu =1.03(5)$. The critical noise obtained and the
fourth-order cumulant were $q_{c}=0.106(5)$ and $U^{*}=0.62(3)$.

  Kudekar et al. recently showed that terminated low-density parity-check
convolutional codes (a.k.a. spatially-coupled low-density parity-check

a-posteriori thresholds. This was proven for binary erasure channels and shown
empirically for binary memoryless symmetric channels. It was conjectured that
the principle of spatial coupling is very general and the phenomenon of
threshold saturation applies to a very broad class of graphical models. In this
work, we derive an area theorem for the joint decoder and empirically show that
threshold saturation occurs for this problem. As a result, we demonstrate
near-universal performance for this problem using the proposed
spatially-coupled coding system.

current instability is believed to significantly enhance the pre-shock
perturbations of magnetic field. We have obtained fully-nonlinear exact ideal
MHD solutions supported by the CR return current. The solutions occur as
localized spikes of circularly polarized Alfven envelopes (solitons, or
breathers). As the conventional (undriven) solitons, the obtained magnetic
spikes propagate at a speed $C$ proportional to their amplitude,
$C=C_{A}B_{{\rm max}}/\sqrt{2}B_{0}$. The sufficiently strong solitons run thus
ahead of the main shock and stand in the precursor, being supported by the
return current. This property of the nonlinear solutions is strikingly
different from the linear theory that predicts non-propagating (that is,
convected downstream) circularly polarized waves. The nonlinear solutions may
come either in isolated pulses (solitons) or in soliton-trains (cnoidal waves).
The morphological similarity of such quasi-periodic soliton chains with
recently observed X-ray stripes in Tycho supernova remnant (SNR) is briefly
discussed. The magnetic field amplification determined by the suggested
saturation process is obtained as a function of decreasing SNR blast wave
velocity during its evolution from the ejecta-dominated to the Sedov-Taylor

most $p$ (nonterminal) vertices whose removal disconnects each terminal from
all other terminals. \textsc{Directed Edge Multiway Cut} is the analogous
problem where $S$ is a set of at most $p$ edges. These two problems indeed are
known to be equivalent. A natural generalization of the multiway cut is the
\emph{multicut} problem, in which we want to disconnect only a set of $k$ given
pairs instead of all pairs. Marx (Theor. Comp. Sci. 2006) showed that in
undirected graphs multiway cut is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized
by $p$. Marx and Razgon (STOC 2011) showed that undirected multicut is FPT and
directed multicut is W[1]-hard parameterized by $p$. We complete the picture
here by our main result which is that both \textsc{Directed Vertex Multiway
Cut} and \textsc{Directed Edge Multiway Cut} can be solved in time
$2^{2^{O(p)}}n^{O(1)}$, i.e., FPT parameterized by size $p$ of the cutset of

the isotropy of the target statistics, the Gram-Charlier expansion is
reformulated with rotation invariant variables. This formulation allows us to
track the geometrical statistics of the cosmic field to all orders. It then
allows us to connect the one point statistics of the critical sets to the
growth factor through perturbation theory, which predicts the redshift
evolution of higher order cumulants. In particular, the cosmic non-linear
evolution of the skeleton's length, together with the statistics of extrema and
Euler characteristic are investigated in turn. In 2D, the corresponding
differential densities are analytic as a function of the excursion set
threshold and the shape parameter. In 3D, the Euler characteristics and the
field isosurface area are also analytic to all orders in the expansion.
Numerical integrations are performed and simple fits are provided whenever
closed form expressions are not available. These statistics are compared to
estimates from N-body simulations and are shown to match well the cosmic
evolution up to root mean square of the density field of ~0.2. In 3D,
gravitational perturbation theory is implemented to predict the cosmic
evolution of all the relevant Gram-Charlier coefficients for universes with
scale invariant matter distribution. The one point statistics of critical sets
could be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianities and the dark energy
equation of state on upcoming cosmic surveys; this is illustrated on idealized
experiments.

shown to deliver state-of-the-art performance. In real-world applications,
however, face images usually suffer from expressions, disguises and random
occlusions. The problematic facial parts undermine the validity of the
linear-subspace assumption and thus the recognition performance deteriorates
significantly. In this work, we address the problem in a
learning-inference-mixed fashion. By observing that the linear-subspace
assumption is more reliable on certain face patches rather than on the holistic
face, some Bayesian Patch Representations (BPRs) are randomly generated and
interpreted according to the Bayes' theory. We then train an ensemble model
over the patch-representations by minimizing the empirical risk w.r.t the
""leave-one-out margins"". The obtained model is termed Optimal Representation
Ensemble (ORE), since it guarantees the optimality from the perspective of
Empirical Risk Minimization. To handle the unknown patterns in test faces, a
robust version of BPR is proposed by taking the non-face category into
consideration. Equipped with the Robust-BPRs, the inference ability of ORE is
increased dramatically and several record-breaking accuracies (99.9% on Yale-B
and 99.5% on AR) and desirable efficiencies (below 20 ms per face in Matlab)
are achieved. It also overwhelms other modular heuristics on the faces with
random occlusions, extreme expressions and disguises. Furthermore, to
accommodate immense BPRs sets, a boosting-like algorithm is also derived. The
boosted model, a.k.a Boosted-ORE, obtains similar performance to its prototype.
Besides the empirical superiorities, two desirable features of the proposed
methods, namely, the training-determined model-selection and the
data-weight-free boosting procedure, are also theoretically verified.

the width of the D^{*0} meson. In the OPE, these IR divergences cancel in the

Here, the main idea is to discuss how the work of Turing allows us to change
our views on the foundations of Mathematics, much like quantum mechanics
changed our conception of the world of Physics. Basic notions like
computability and universality are discussed in a broad context, making special
emphasis on how the notion of complexity can be given a precise meaning after
Turing, i.e., not just qualitative but also quantitative. Turing's work is
given some historical perspective with respect to some of his precursors,

wish to decipher the solution of this problem in the context of $r$-modes
instability in neutron stars, as it appears when these modes are coupled to
gravitational radiation.
  We consider a rotating spherical shell filled with a viscous fluid but of
infinite electrical conductivity and analyze propagation of modal perturbations
when a dipolar magnetic field is bathing the fluid layer. We perform an
extensive numerical analysis and find that the $m=2$ $r$-mode oscillation is
influenced by the magnetic field when the Lehnert number (ratio of Alfv\'en
speed to rotation speed) exceeds a value proportional to the one-fourth power
of the Ekman number (non-dimensional measure of viscosity). This scaling is
interpreted as the coincidence of the width of internal shear layers of
inertial modes and the wavelength of the Alfv\'en waves. Applied to the case of
rotating magnetic neutron stars, we find that dipolar magnetic fields above
$10^{14}$ G are necessary to perturb the $r$-modes instability.

neutrons stars, is subject to correlations of infinite range due to the
antisymmetrisation of the N-body wave function, which cannot be explicitly
accounted for in a practical simulation. This problem is usually addressed in
condensed matter physics by means of the so-called Twist Averaged Boundary

representation has been proposed in the context of antisymmetrized molecular

variational approaches, which are currently used for the description of stellar

both the canonical min-max duality and the double-max duality still hold
strongly, but the double-min duality holds weakly in a symmetrical form. Four

  while advanced time displacement is mainly due to finite life time of pion","12 pages for 12pt",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  First we call the attention that velocity defined by ratio between some
intervals of space and time respectively is sometimes ambiguous, in the
framework of quantum theory. Velocity in general is not possible to be well
defined as some generator of certain space-time symmetry operation. Then in
section 3 by analyzing the OPERA experiment we show that the OPERA
Collaboration may have measured the phase speed of the neutrino wave function.
Employing a very (maybe too) simple model which is just a reproduction from
Brillouin's classical book, we demonstrate the phase velocity and group
velocity. These are just a qualitative illustration rather than aiming to
quantitively explain the OPERA data. However, how to rigorously define the
phase containing the particle production ordering information as a space-time
distribution observable in QFT needs more investigations. Due to the finite
life time of the pions (w.r.t. its flying time in the 1 km long tunnel) which
decay to the muon neutrinos, the wave form for neutrinos recorded by OPERA is
deformed from that of the proton. Such an effect is estimated to lead to an
advanced time displacement of the order of 100ns, which coincides with the
measured. Such an effect can only be significant when measuring phase speed and
the recorded neutrino events per extraction of proton smaller than one, as the
OPERA case.

structure by removing links and measure how much the communities change.
However, perturbing sparse networks is challenging because they are inherently
sensitive; they shatter easily if links are removed. Here we propose a simple
method to perturb sparse networks and assess the significance of their
communities. We generate resampled networks by adding extra links based on
local information, then we aggregate the information from multiple resampled
networks to find a coarse-grained description of significant clusters. In
addition to testing our method on benchmark networks, we use our method on the

interacting elementary particle is encoded on the relativistic geometrodynamics
of the boundary of the theory through local transformations of the underlying
space-time coordinates. Therefore, gauge interaction is described as invariance
of the theory under local deformations of the boundary, the resulting local
variations of field solution are interpreted as internal transformations, and
the internal symmetries of the gauge theory turn out to be related to
corresponding local space-time symmetries. In the case of local infinitesimal
isometric transformations, Maxwell's kinematics and gauge invariance are
inferred directly from the variational principle. Furthermore we explicitly
impose periodic conditions at the boundary of the theory as semi-classical
quantization condition in order to investigate the quantum behavior of gauge
interaction. In the abelian case the result is a remarkable formal
correspondence with scalar QED.

assumption of periodic boundary conditions represents a consistent
semi-classical quantization condition for relativistic fields. In
[arXiv:0903.3680] we have shown, for instance, that the ordinary Feynman path
integral is obtained from the interference between the classical paths with
different winding numbers associated with the cyclic dynamics of the field
solutions. By means of the boundary conditions, the kinematics information of
interactions can be encoded on the relativistic geometrodynamics of the
boundary [arXiv:1110.0315]. Furthermore, such a purely four-dimensional theory
is manifestly dual to an extra-dimensional field theory. The resulting
correspondence between extra-dimensional geometrodynamics and ordinary quantum
behavior can be interpreted in terms of AdS/CFT correspondence. By applying
this approach to a simple Quark-Gluon-Plasma freeze-out model we obtain
fundamental analogies with basic aspects of AdS/QCD phenomenology.

the newly formed neutron star are shocked at several thousands km, and form hot
high-pressure bubbles. These bubbles merge to form a large bubble that explode
the star. In the current study we assume a spherically symmetric homogenous

reactions take place. The jets last for about one second, their velocity is
v_j=0.5c, and their total energy is 10^51 erg. We use jets' neutron enrichment
independent on time, and follow the nuclear reactions to the formation of the
seed nuclei up to $Z \leq 50$, on which more neutrons will be absorbed to form
the r-process elements. Based on the mass of the seed nuclei we find the
r-process element mass in our idealized model to be several times 10^-4

More realistic calculations that relax the assumptions of a homogenous bubble

be computed and compared with the Fermi-LAT results to derive constraints on

and galaxy effective radii in an effort to compare and contrast the properties
of likely protocluster galaxies with their field counterparts and to look for
correlations between galaxy structure and (projected) distance relative to the
radio galaxy.
  We find a hint that quiescent, cluster galaxies are on average less dense
than quiescent field galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift. In fact, we
find only two (of nine) quiescent protocluster galaxies are of simliar density
to the majority of the massive, quiescent compact galaxies (SEEDs) found in
several field surveys. Furthermore, there is some indication that the
structural Sersic n parameter is higher (n ~ 3-4) on average for cluster
galaxies compared to the field SEEDs (n ~ 1-2) This result may imply that the
accelerated galaxy evolution expected (and observed) in overdense regions also
extends to structural evolution presuming that massive galaxies began as dense

there is no remarkable site-dependence around room temperature, the local spin
susceptibility gradually disproportionates among the nonequivalent sites with
decreasing temperature. The disproportionation-ratio yields 5:4:6 for A:B:C
molecules at 140 K. Distinct site- and temperature-dependences are also
observed in the Korringa ratio, $\mathcal{K}_i \propto (1/T_{1}T)_iK^{-2}_i$
($i$ = A, B, and C), which is a measure of the strength and the type of
electron correlations. The values of $\mathcal{K}_i$ point to sizable
antiferromagnetic spin correlation. We argue the present results in terms of
the theoretical prediction of the peculiar site-specific reciprocal-space
($\bm{k}$-space) anisotropy on the tilted Dirac cone, and discuss the
$\bm{k}$-dependent profiles of the spin susceptibility and electron correlation
on the cone.

lattice and not in the continuum. It was claimed that this could lead to a
larger amplitude and a wrong shape for the gravitational wave (GW) spectra
obtained in numerical simulations of (p)reheating. In order to address this
issue, we have defined a consistent prescription in the lattice for extracting
the TT part of the metric perturbations. We demonstrate explicitly that the GW

based on the average sphericity of voids posited on the local isotropy of the
Universe. It works by comparing the temporal extent of cosmic voids along the
line of sight with their angular, spatial extent. We describe the algorithm
that we use to detect and stack voids in redshift shells on the light cone and
test it on mock light cones produced from N-body simulations. We establish a
robust statistical model for estimating the average stretching of voids in
redshift space and quantify the contamination by peculiar velocities. Finally,
assuming that the void statistics that we derive from N-body simulations is
preserved when considering galaxy surveys, we assess the capability of this
approach to constrain dark energy parameters. We report this assessment in
terms of the figure of merit (FoM) of the dark energy task force and in
particular of the proposed EUCLID mission which is particularly suited for this
technique since it is a spectroscopic survey. The FoM due to stacked voids from
the EUCLID wide survey may double that of all other dark energy probes derived
from EUCLID data alone (combined with Planck priors). In particular, voids seem
to outperform Baryon Acoustic Oscillations by an order of magnitude. This
result is consistent with simple estimates based on mode-counting. The AP test
based on stacked voids may be a significant addition to the portfolio of major
dark energy probes and its potentialities must be studied in detail.

behavior on such a homophily-driven social network is affected by the changing
network structure. In particular, using simulations, we study a variant of the
Axelrod model on a network with a homophilic rewiring rule imposed. First, we
find that the presence of homophilic rewiring within the network, in general,
impedes the reaching of consensus in opinion, as the time to reach consensus
diverges exponentially with network size $N$. We then investigate whether the
introduction of committed individuals who are rigid in their opinion on a
particular issue, can speed up the convergence to consensus on that issue. We
demonstrate that as committed agents are added, beyond a critical value of the
committed fraction, the consensus time growth becomes logarithmic in network

far worse. Near OPERA energies both an energy-independent velocity, as well as
a linear energy dependence with an offset that is comparable in value to the
observed {\delta}v by OPERA at 28.1 GeV works very well. Our analysis shows
that precision arrival time data from SN1987a still allow for superluminal

reconciles OPERA and SN1987a quite well. It suggests a fourth power energy

a weakly dispersive electronic band of the helical system. The weak electronic

general-purpose particle physics detectors built at the LHC (Large Hadron

with a highly distributed computing environment and Petabytes/year of data
being collected makes CMS unlike any other High Energy Physics collaborations
before. This presents new challenges to educate and bring users, coming from
different cultural, linguistics and social backgrounds, up to speed to
contribute to the physics analysis. CMS has been able to deal with this new
paradigm by deploying a user support structure model that uses collaborative
tools to educate about software, computing an physics tools specific to CMS. To
carry out the user support mission worldwide, an LHC Physics Centre (LPC) was
created few years back at Fermilab as a hub for US physicists. The LPC serves
as a ""brick and mortar"" location for physics excellence for the CMS physicists
where graduate and postgraduate scientists can find experts in all aspects of
data analysis and learn via tutorials, workshops, conferences and gatherings.
Following the huge success of LPC, a centre at CERN itself called LHC Physics
Centre at CERN (LPCC) and Terascale Analysis Centre at DESY have been created
with similar goals. The CMS user support model would also facilitate in making
the non-CMS scientific community learn about CMS physics. A good example of
this is the effort by HEP experiments, including CMS, to focus on data
preservation efforts. In order to facilitate its use by the future scientific
community, who may want to re-visit our data, and re-analyze it, CMS is
evaluating the resources required. A detailed, good quality and well-maintained
documentation by the user support group about the CMS computing and software
may go a long way to help in this endeavour.

compare for the first time in one and the same event the temporal evolution of
coronal EUV dimmings, observed simultaneously on-disk and above the limb. We
find that these dimmings are synchronized and appear during the impulsive
acceleration phase of the CME, with the highest EUV intensity drop occurring a
few minutes after the maximum CME acceleration. During the propagation phase
two confined, bipolar dimming regions, appearing near the footpoints of a
pre-flare sigmoid structure, show an apparent migration away from the site of
the CME-associated flare. Additionally, they rotate around the 'center' of the
flare site, i.e., the configuration of the dimmings exhibits the same
'sheared-to-potential' evolution as the postflare loops. We conclude that the
motion pattern of the twin dimmings reflects not only the eruption of the flux
rope, but also the ensuing stretching of the overlying arcade. Finally, we find
that: (1) the global-scale dimmings, expanding from the source region of the
eruption, propagate with a speed similar to that of the leaving CME front; (2)
the mass loss occurs mainly during the period of strongest CME acceleration.
Two hours after the eruption Hinode/EIS observations show no substantial plasma
outflow, originating from the 'open' field twin dimming regions.

Then, the motion of a parametrically driven mode is detected by the induced

compressible fluid, rotating about the vertical axis. At the upper and lower
bounding surfaces, perfectly-conducting boundary conditions are adopted for the
magnetic field. Two different levels of thermal stratification are considered.
If the magnetic diffusivity is sufficiently small, the convection acts as a
small-scale dynamo. Using a definition for the magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$
that is based upon the horizontal integral scale and the horizontally-averaged
velocity at the mid-layer of the domain, we find that rotation tends to reduce
the critical value of $R_M$ above which dynamo action is observed. Increasing
the level of thermal stratification within the layer does not significantly
alter the critical value of $R_M$ in the rotating calculations, but it does
lead to a reduction in this critical value in the non-rotating cases. At the
highest computationally-accessible values of the magnetic Reynolds number, the
saturation levels of the dynamo are similar in all cases, with the mean
magnetic energy density somewhere between 4 and 9% of the mean kinetic energy
density. To gain further insights into the differences between rotating and
non-rotating convection, we quantify the stretching properties of each flow by
measuring Lyapunov exponents. Away from the boundaries, the rate of stretching
due to the flow is much less dependent upon depth in the rotating cases than it
is in the corresponding non-rotating calculations. It is also shown that the
effects of rotation significantly reduce the magnetic energy dissipation in the
lower part of the layer. We also investigate certain aspects of the saturation

decay is studied in an isobar resonance model with the assumption that the
$\phi$-meson is produced from intermediate nucleon resonances. The
contributions from the $N^*_{1/2^-}(1535)$, $N^*_{3/2^+}(1900)$,
$N^*_{1/2^-}(2090)$ and $N^*_{1/2^+}(2100)$ states are considered. In terms of
the coupling constants $g^{2}_{\phi N N^{*}}$ and $g^{2}_{\phi N N^{*}}$
extracted from the data of the partial decay widths of the $N^*$s to the $N\pi$
channel, the reaction cross section of the $\pi^{-}p\rightarrow n\phi$ process
and the partial decay widths of the $J/\psi\rightarrow p\bar{p}\eta$ and
$J/\psi\rightarrow p\bar{n}\pi^{-}$ processes, respectively, the invariant mass
spectrum and the Dalitz plot for $ J/\psi \to p \bar{p} \phi$ are predicted. It
is shown that there are two types of results. In the type I case, a large peak
structure around 2.09GeV implies that a considerable mount of $N\phi$ or
$qqqs\bar s$ component may exist in the narrow-width $N^*_{1/2^-}(2090)$ state,
but for the wide-width $N^*_{1/2^+}(2100)$ state, it has little $qqqs\bar s$
component. In the type II case, a small peak around 2.11GeV may only indicate
the existence of a certain mount of $p\phi$ or $qqqs\bar s$ component in the
narrow-width $N^*_{1/2^+}(2100)$ state, but no information for the wide-width
$N^*_{1/2^-}(2090)$ state. Further BESIII data with high statistics would help
us to distinguish the strange structures of these $N^*$s.

However, the specific mechanism that may underlie similarities in nature and

propose a parsimonious bipartite-cooperation model that reproduces the key
features of mutualistic networks - degree distribution, nestedness and
modularity -- for both ecological networks and socio-economic networks. Our
analysis uses two diverse networks. Mutually-beneficial interactions between
plants and their pollinators, and cooperative economic exchanges between
designers and their contractors. We find that these mutualistic networks share
a key hierarchical ordering of their members, along with an exponential
constraint in the number and type of partners they can cooperate with. We use
our model to show that slight changes in the interaction constraints can
produce either extremely nested or random structures, revealing that these
constraints play a key role in the evolution of mutualistic networks. This
could also encourage a new systematic approach to study the functional and
structural properties of networks. The surprising correspondence across
mutualistic networks suggests their broadly representativeness and their
potential role in the productive organization of exchange systems, both
ecological and social.

terms of phenomenological theory for the case of a thin plate subjected to
bending. It has been shown that despite an explicit asymmetry inherent to the
bulk constitutive electromechanical equations which take into account the
flexoelectric coupling, the electromechanical response for a finite sample is
""symmetric"". ""Symmetric"" means that if a sensor and an actuator are made of a
flexoelectric element, performance of such devices can be characterized by the
same effective piezoelectric coefficient. This behavior is consistent with the
thermodynamic arguments offered earlier, being in conflict with the current
point of view on the matter in literature. This result was obtained using
standard mechanical boundary conditions valid for the case where the
polarization vanishes at the surface. It was shown that, for the case where
there is the polarization is nonzero at the surface, the aforementioned
symmetry of electromechanical response may be violated if standard mechanical
boundary conditions are used, leading to a conflict with the thermodynamic
arguments. It was argued that this conflict may be resolved when using modified
mechanical boundary conditions. It was also shown that the contribution of
surface piezoelectricity to the flexoelectric response of a finite sample is
expected to be comparable to that of the static bulk contribution (including
the material with high values of the dielectric constant) and to scale as the
bulk value of the dielectric constant (similar to the bulk contribution). This
finding implies that if the experimentally measured flexoelectric coefficient
scales as the dielectric constant of the material, this does not imply that the
measured flexoelectric response is controlled by the static bulk contribution
to the flexoelectric effect.

association of synchronous trading with individual performance and

second-to-second trading and instant messaging, we find that the higher the
traders' synchronous trading, the less likely they lose money at the end of the

synchronicity and vanguard technology may help cope with risky decisions in
