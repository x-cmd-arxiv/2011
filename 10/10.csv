representations are natural for the simultaneous examination of microscopic,
mesoscopic, and macroscopic features. In this paper, we treat granular
materials as spatially-embedded networks in which the nodes (particles) are
connected by weighted edges obtained from contact forces. We test a variety of
network measures for their utility in helping to describe sound propagation in
granular networks and find that network diagnostics can be used to probe
particle-, curve-, domain-, and system-scale structures in granular media. In
particular, diagnostics of meso-scale network structure are reproducible across
experiments, are correlated with sound propagation in this medium, and can be
used to identify potentially interesting size scales. We also demonstrate that
the sensitivity of network diagnostics depends on the phase of sound
propagation. In the injection phase, the signal propagates systemically, as
indicated by correlations with the network diagnostic of global efficiency. In
the scattering phase, however, the signal is better predicted by meso-scale
community structure, suggesting that the acoustic signal scatters over local
geographic neighborhoods. Collectively, our results demonstrate how the force
network of a granular system is imprinted on transmitted waves.

modern information infrastructures. The effectiveness of an IDS is directly
related to the computational resources at its disposal. However, it is
difficult to guarantee especially with an increasing demand of network capacity
and rapid proliferation of attacks. On the other hand, modern intrusions often
come as sequences of attacks to reach some predefined goals. It is therefore
critical to identify the best default IDS configuration to attain the highest
possible overall protection within a given resource budget. This paper proposes
a game theory based solution to the problem of optimal signature-based IDS
configuration under resource constraints. We apply the concepts of indices of
power, namely, Shapley value and Banzhaf-Coleman index, from cooperative game
theory to quantify the influence or contribution of libraries in an IDS with
respect to given attack graphs. Such valuations take into consideration the
knowledge on common attack graphs and experienced system attacks and are used
to configure an IDS optimally at its default state by solving a knapsack
optimization problem.

example, the Solovay degrees and the $K$-degrees of computably enumerable reals

degrees of randomness based on plain and prefix-free complexity are not

generalization of the planar web. An Abelian relation for a Legendrian web is
analogously defined as an additive equation among the first integrals of its
foliations. For a class of Legendrian $\, d$-webs defined by simple second

employ the method of local differential analysis and the theory of linear
differential systems to show that $\, \rho_d$ is the maximum rank of a

Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP), is strongly coupled, with partonic degrees of

believed to suffer energy loss via induced gluon radiation and elastic
collisions, before exiting the medium and fragmenting in vacuum. Jet
reconstruction and high pT correlation studies allow us to investigate how the
partons interact with the medium and how the medium responds to the partons
moving through it. By comparing measurements from pp and d-Au to those in Au-Au

light-induced electron spin resonance (LESR) spectra and transient ESR response
signals are recorded on non-annealed and annealed blend layers consisting of
alkyl substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene copolymers (pATBT) and the soluble
fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) at
temperatures ranging from 10 to 180 K. Annealing of the blend sample leads to a
reduction of the steady state concentration of light-induced PCBM anions within
the blend at low temperatures (T = 10 K) and continuous illumination. This is
explained on the basis of the reducing interfacial area of the blend composite
on annealing, and the high activation energy for electron diffusion in PCBM
blends leading to trapped electrons near the interface with the CP. As a
consequence, these trapped electrons block consecutive electron transfer from
an exciton on a CP to the PCBM domain, resulting in a relatively low
concentration charge carriers in the annealed blend. Analysis of the transient
ESR data allows us to conclude that in annealed samples diamagnetic
bi-polaronic states on the CPs are generated at low temperature. The formation
of these states is related to the generation and interaction of multiple
positive polarons in the large crystalline polymer domains present in the
annealed sample.

doping, pressure, and elastic moduli, displaying split magnetic and nematic
tri-critical points. The nematic transition may instantly bring the system to
the verge of a magnetic transition, or it may occur first, being followed by a
magnetic transition at a lower temperature. In the latter case, the preemptive
nematic transition is accompanied by either a jump or a rapid increase of the
magnetic correlation length, triggering a pseudogap behavior associated with
magnetic precursors. Furthermore, due to the distinct orbital character of each
Fermi pocket, the nematic transition also induces orbital order. We compare our
results to various experiments, showing that they correctly address the changes

the Uniform Additive Model, both computing the optimal marketing strategy and
computing the best IE strategy are $\NP$-hard for undirected social networks.
We observe that allowing IE strategies to offer prices smaller than the myopic
price in the exploit step leads to a measurable improvement on their
performance. Thus, we show that the best IE strategy approximates the maximum
revenue within a factor of 0.911 for undirected and of roughly 0.553 for
directed networks. Moreover, we present a natural generalization of IE
strategies, with more than two pricing classes, and show that they approximate

strategies and large cuts in the underlying social network, we obtain

induced gluon radiation to the DY dilepton spectra in terms of nuclear modified
effective beam quark distribution functions. The modification depends on the
quark transport parameter in nuclear medium. This is similar to the final-state
multiple parton scattering in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off large

negligible at the Fermilab energy $E_{\rm lab}$=800 GeV in the kinematic region

events for offline analysis is a challenge due to the high rates and
multiplicities of particles produced. Maintaining high trigger efficiency for
the physics we are most interested in while at the same time suppressing high
rate physics from inclusive QCD processes is a difficult but important problem.
It is essential that the trigger system be flexible and robust, with sufficient
redundancy and operating margin. Providing high quality track reconstruction
over the full ATLAS detector by the start of processing at LVL2 is an important
element to achieve these needs. As the instantaneous luminosity increases, the
computational load on the LVL2 system will significantly increase due to the
need for more sophisticated algorithms to suppress backgrounds.
  The Fast Tracker (FTK) is a proposed upgrade to the ATLAS trigger system. It
is designed to enable early rejection of background events and thus leave more
LVL2 execution time by moving track reconstruction into a hardware system that
takes massively parallel processing to the extreme. The FTK system completes
global track reconstruction with near offline resolution shortly after the
start of LVL2 processing by rapidly finding and fitting tracks in the inner
detector for events passing LVL1 using pattern recognition from a large,
pre-computed bank of possible hit patterns. We describe the FTK system design
and expected performance in the areas of b-tagging, {\tau}-tagging, and lepton
isolation which play and important role in the ATLAS physics program.

matter-dark energy revisited. The character of MGCG is endued with the dual
role, which behaves as matter at early times and as an quiessence dark energy
at late times. The equation of state for MGCG is
$p=-\alpha\rho/(1+\alpha)-\vartheta(z)\rho^{-\alpha}/(1+\alpha) $, where
$\vartheta(z)=-[\rho_{0c}(1+z)^{3}]^{(1+\alpha)}(1-\Omega_{0B})^{\alpha}\{\alpha\Omega_{0DM}+
\Omega_{0DE}[\omega_{DE}+\alpha(1+\omega_{DE})](1+z)^{3\omega_{DE}(1+\alpha)}\}$.
Some cosmological quantities, such as the densities of different components of
the universe $\Omega_{i}$ ($i$ respectively denotes baryons, dark matter and
dark energy) and the deceleration parameter $q$, are obtained. The present
deceleration parameter $q_{0}$, the transition redshift $z_{T}$ and the
redshift $z_{eq}$, which describes the epoch when the densities in dark matter
and dark energy are equal, are also calculated. To distinguish MGCG from
others, we then apply the Statefinder diagnostic. Later on, the parameters
($\alpha$ and $\omega_{DE}$) of MGCG are constrained by combination of the
sound speed $c^{2}_{s}$, the age of the universe $t_{0}$, the growth factor $m$
and the bias parameter $b$. It yields
$\alpha=-3.07^{+5.66}_{-4.98}\times10^{-2}$ and
$\omega_{DE}=-1.05^{+0.06}_{-0.11}$. Through the analysis of the growth of
density perturbations for MGCG, it is found that the energy will transfer from
dark matter to dark energy which reach equal at $z_{eq}\sim 0.48$ and the
density fluctuations start deviating from the linear behavior at $z\sim 0.25$
caused by the dominance of dark energy.

the axes, $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$, of the tri-variate Gaussian to which we have
fit the galaxy distribution in effective radius, surface brightness, and
central velocity dispersion (FP space), and compute median values of stellar
age, [Fe/H], [Z/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe]. We determine the directions of the
vectors in FP space along which each of the binned stellar population
parameters vary most strongly. In contrast to previous work, we find stellar
population trends not just with velocity dispersion and FP residual, but with
radius and surface brightness as well. The most remarkable finding is that the
stellar population parameters vary through the plane ($v_1$ direction) and
across the plane ($v_3$ direction), but show no variation at all along the
plane ($v_2$ direction). The $v_2$ direction in FP space roughly corresponds to
`luminosity density'. We interpret a galaxy's position along this vector as
being closely tied to its merger history, such that early-type galaxies with
lower luminosity density are more likely to have undergone major mergers. This
conclusion is reinforced by an examination of the simulations of Kobayashi
(2005), which show clear trends of merger history with $v_2$.

The underlying mechanism could be modeled as a polaron motion in the molecular

consideration, we generalize the Holstein model (molecular crystal model) to
microscopically describe an ET chemical reaction. In our model, the electron
spins in the radical pair simultaneously interact with a magnetic field and
their nuclear-spin environments. By virtue of the perturbation approach, we
obtain the chemical reaction rates for different initial states. It is
discovered that the chemical reaction rate of the triplet state demonstrates
its dependence on the direction of the magnetic field while the counterpart of
the singlet state does not. This difference is attributed to the explicit
dependence of the triplet state on the direction when the axis is rotated. Our
model may provide a possible candidate for the microscopic origin of avian

SDSS DR 7. We classify the galaxies into early and late types, and identify
bars by visual inspection. Among 10,674 late-type galaxies with axis ratio
$b/a>0.60$, we find 3,240 barred galaxies ($f_{bar}=30.4%$) which divide into
2,542 strong bars ($f_{SB1}=23.8%$) and 698 weak bars ($f_{SB2}=6.5%$). We find
that $f_{SB1}$ increases as $u-r$ color becomes redder, and that it has a
maximum value at intermediate velocity dispersion ($\sigma\simeq$150 km
s$^{-1}$). This trend suggests that strong bars are dominantly hosted by
intermediate-mass systems. Weak bars prefer bluer galaxies with lower mass and
lower concentration. In the case of strong bars, their dependence on the
concentration index appears only for massive galaxies with $\sigma>150$ km
s$^{-1}$. We also find that $f_{bar}$ does not directly depend on the
large-scale background density when other physical parameters ($u-r$ color or
$\sigma$) are fixed. We discover that $f_{SB1}$ decreases as the separation to
the nearest neighbor galaxy becomes smaller than 0.1 times the virial radius of
the neighbor regardless of neighbor's morphology. These results imply that
strong bars are likely to be destroyed during strong tidal interactions, and
that the mechanism for this phenomenon is gravitational and not hydrodynamical.
The fraction of weak bars has no correlation with environmental parameters. We
do not find any direct evidence for environmental stimulation of bar formation.

treatment of multiple interactions of photons in a complicated geometry is
essential to modeling the reprocessed emissions from the dense clouds. We
develop a new calculation framework of X-ray reflection from molecular clouds

first calculations of morphologies and spectra of the reflected X-ray emission
for several realistic models of Sgr B2, which is the most massive molecular
cloud in our Galaxy. The morphology of scattered hard X-rays above 20 keV is
significantly different from that of iron fluorescence due to their large
penetrating power into dense regions of the cloud, probing the structure of the
cloud. High-resolution spectra provide quantitative evaluation of the iron line
including its Compton shoulder to constrain the mass and the chemical
composition of the cloud as well as the luminosity of the illuminating source.
These predictions can be checked in the near future with future X-ray missions
such as NuStar (hard X-rays) and ASTRO-H (both iron lines and hard X-rays).

Telescope(VLT). It is a very efficient, single-target, intermediate-resolution
spectrograph that was installed at the Cassegrain focus of UT2 in 2009. The
instrument covers, in a single exposure, the spectral range from 300 to 2500
nm. It is designed to maximize the sensitivity in this spectral range through
dichroic splitting in three arms with optimized optics, coatings, dispersive
elements and detectors. It operates at intermediate spectral resolution
(R~4,000 - 17,000, depending on wavelength and slit width) with fixed echelle
spectral format (prism cross-dispersers) in the three arms. It includes a
1.8""x4"" Integral Field Unit as an alternative to the 11"" long slits. A
dedicated data reduction package delivers fully calibrated two-dimensional and
extracted spectra over the full wavelength range. We describe the main
characteristics of the instrument and present its performance as measured
during commissioning, science verification and the first months of science
operations.

The Emery three-band model, extended with Ox-Oy hopping tpp, and with Ud
tending to infinity, is mapped on slave fermions. The Dyson time-dependent
diagrammatic theory in terms of the Cu-O hopping tpd, which starts from the
nondegenerate unperturbed ground state, is translationally and asymptotically
locally gauge invariant. The small parameter of the theory is nd. The lowest
order of the theory generates the single particle propagators of the hybridized
pdp- and dpd-fermions with the exact three band structure. The leading
many-body effect is band narrowing, obtained without mean-field slave particle
approximations. Damping found in the single particle propagation is related to
incoherent Cu-O2 intracell ""mixed valence"" fluctuations. The corresponding
continuum falls below the Fermi level. The conventional Luttinger sum rule for
coherent bands is thus broken. Due to local gauge invariance, these results are
insensitive to the replacement of the Cu-O anticommutations by commutations.
This replacement affects the effective local kinematic repulsion Ud\mu\ between
the hybridized pdp hole propagators. The a posteriori antisymmetrization of
Ud\mu\ removes the repulsion between the pdp particles in the triplet
configuration, keeping their singlet repulsion intact. Such a Ud\mu\ is
moderate, and close to optimal doping favors the coherent, antinodal, low
energy SDW correlations. Resonant valence bonds which involve Jpd appear as
incoherent perturbative corrections to these correlations. In function of
doping and/or frequency, the incoherent ""mixed valence"" fluctuations compete
with magnetic coherence. This dichotomy, between properties local in the direct
and reciprocal space, is the fundamental feature of the Emery model in the
large Ud metallic limit.

additional (intensive) term to the action for the molecular dynamics part of
the algorithm. The metropolis step still uses the exact action, so that the
Monte Carlo algorithm still generates the correct ensemble. By tuning this new
term, we hope to be able to balance the acceptance rate of the HMC algorithm
and the rate of topological index changes. We also describe how suppressing,
but not eliminating, the small eigenvalues of the kernel operator may improve
the volume scaling of the cost per trajectory for overlap HMC while still
allowing topological index changes.
  We test this operator on small lattices, comparing our new algorithm with an
old overlap HMC algorithm with a slower rate of topological charge changes, and
an overlap HMC algorithm which fixes the topology. Our new HMC algorithm more
than doubles the rate of topological index changes compared to the previous
state of the art, while maintaining the same metropolis acceptance rate. We
investigate the effect of topological index changes on the local topological
charge density, measured using an improved field theoretic operator after heavy
smearing. We find that the creation and annihilation of large lumps of

The profusion of resonances throughout the measured energy range has led to
speculation that there is an unknown resonance at E\sim1.5 MeV possibly as
strong as the one measured for the resonance at 2.14 MeV. We study the
implications that such a resonance would have for the physics of SNIa, paying
special attention to the phases that go from the crossing of the ignition curve
to the dynamical event. We use one-dimensional hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
codes to follow the evolution of accreting white dwarfs until they grow close
to the Chandrasekhar mass and explode as SNIa. In our simulations, we account
for a low-energy resonance by exploring the parameter space allowed by
experimental data. A change in the ^{12}C+^{12}C rate similar to the one
explored here would have profound consequences for the physical conditions in
the SNIa explosion, namely the central density, neutronization, thermal
profile, mass of the convective core, location of the runaway hot spot, or time
elapsed since crossing the ignition curve. For instance, with the largest
resonance strength we use, the time elapsed since crossing the ignition curve
to the supernova event is shorter by a factor ten than for models using the
standard rate of ^{12}C+^{12}C, and the runaway temperature is reduced from
\sim8.14\times10^{8} K to \sim4.26\times10^{8} K. On the other hand, a
resonance at 1.5 MeV, with a strength ten thousand times smaller than the one
measured at 2.14 MeV, but with an {\alpha}/p yield ratio substantially
different from 1 would have a sizeable impact on the degree of neutronization
of matter during carbon simmering. We conclude that a robust understanding of
the links between SNIa properties and their progenitors will not be attained
until the ^{12}C+^{12}C reaction rate is measured at energies \sim1.5 MeV.

derive not only robust snapshots of the ICP thermal state, but also the
'concentration' parameter marking the age of the host dark matter halo. We test
these profiles for consistency with numerical simulations and observations. We
find the central and the outer entropy to correlate, so that these clusters
split into two main classes defined on the basis of low (LE) or high (HE)
entropy conditions prevailing throughout the ICP. We also find inverse
correlations between the central/outer entropy and the halo concentration. We
interpret these in terms of mapping the ICP progress on timescales around 5 Gyr
toward higher concentrations, under the drive of the dark matter halo
development. The progress proceeds from HEs to LEs, toward states of deeper
entropy erosion by radiative cooling in the inner regions, and of decreasing
outer entropy production as the accretion peters out. We propose these radial
and time features to constitute a cluster Grand Design, that we use here to
derive a number of predictions. For HE clusters we predict sustained outer
temperature profiles. For LEs we expect the outer entropy ramp to bend over,
hence the temperature decline to steepen at low z; this feature goes together
with an increasing turbulent support, a condition that can be directly probed

shows that assuming the connectedness of the phase space implies the existence
of a considerably deeper classification of topological flow behaviour, in the
vicinity of compact invariant sets, than that described in the classical
theorems of Ura-Kimura and Bhatia. The proposed classification brings to light,
in a systematic way, the possibility of occurrence of orbits of infinite height
arbitrarily near the compact invariant in question, and this under relatively
simple conditions. Singularities of smooth vector fields displaying this
strange phenomenon occur in every dimension greater than 2 (in this paper, a
smooth flow on the 3-dimensional sphere exhibiting such an equilibrium is
constructed). Near periodic orbits, the same phenomenon is observable already
in dimension 4 (and on every manifold of dimension greater than 4). As a
corollary to the main result, an elegant characterization of the topological
Hausdorff structure of the set of all compact minimal sets of the flow is

Specifically, we propose a general statistical model to describe network
structure. In this model, group is viewed as hidden or unobserved quantity and
it is learned by fitting the observed network data using the
expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared with existing models, the most
prominent strength of our model is the high flexibility. This strength enables
it to possess the advantages of existing models and overcomes their
shortcomings in a unified way. As a result, not only broad types of structure
can be detected without prior knowledge of what type of intrinsic regularities
exist in the network, but also the type of identified structure can be directly
learned from data. Moreover, by differentiating outgoing edges from incoming
edges, our model can detect several types of structural regularities beyond
competing models. Tests on a number of real world and artificial networks
demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art model at shedding
light on the structural features of networks, including the overlapping
community structure, multipartite structure and several other types of
structure which are beyond the capability of existing models.

in general include gravitational clustering described by the fluid's

to take advantage of the full three-dimensional information inherent to the

of magnitude seems possible with a combination of Euclid and Planck data.

($\propto \Lx^{0.43}$), the group stellar mass ($\propto \Lx^{0.46}$), with
typical 1-$\sigma$ scatter of $\sim 0.67$ in $\log \Lx$. Using the observed

between the X-ray luminosity, the central galaxy stellar mass and the
characteristic satellite stellar mass as ${\log L_X} = -0.26 + 2.90 [\log
(M_{\ast, c} + 0.26 M_{\rm sat}) -12.0]$ (and in terms of luminosities, as
${\log L_X} = -0.15 + 2.38 [\log (L_{c} + 0.72 L_{\rm sat}) -12.0]$). We find
that the systematic difference between different halo mass estimations, e.g.,
using the ranking of characteristic group stellar mass or using the X-ray
luminosity scaling relation can be used to constrain cosmology. Comparing the

Polyadic decomposition) to a multi-way array or higher-order tensor, is
equivalent to finding a best low-rank approximation to the multi-way array or
higher-order tensor, where the rank is defined as the outer-product rank.
However, such a best low-rank approximation may not exist due to the fact that
the set of multi-way arrays with rank at most $R$ is not closed for $R\ge 2$.
Nonexistence of a best low-rank approximation results in (groups of) diverging
rank-1 components when an attempt is made to compute the approximation. In this
note, we show that in a group of two or three diverging components, the
components converge to proportionality almost everywhere. A partial proof of
this result for larger groups of diverging components is also given. Also, we
give examples of groups of three, four, and six non-proportional diverging
components. These examples are shown to be exceptional cases.

concave function of the transmit power. We elaborate examples of various system
models including time-varying parallel channels. Rate functions with an
arbitrary discrete modulation scheme are also treated. The examples considered
lead to water-filling solutions, but these are different from the dual problems
of power minimization under rate constraints and rate maximization under power
constraints, respectively, because the constraints need not be active. We also
demonstrate that if the solution to a rate maximization problem is known, it
can be utilized to reduce the EE problem into a one-dimensional convex problem.

previously reported to produce the first sunquake in solar cycle 24 (Kosovichev
2011). Using acoustic holography, we confirm the first, and report a second,
weaker, seismic source associated with this flare. We find that the two sources
are located at either end of a sigmoid which indicates the presence of a flux
rope. Contrary to the majority of previously reported sunquakes, the acoustic
emission precedes the peak of major hard X-ray (HXR) sources by several
minutes. Furthermore, the strongest hard X-ray footpoints derived from RHESSI
data are found to be located away from the seismic sources in the flare
ribbons. We account for these discrepancies within the context of a
phenomenological model of a flux rope eruption and accompanying two-ribbon
flare. We propose that the sunquakes are triggered at the footpoints of the
erupting flux rope at the start of the flare impulsive phase and eruption
onset, while the main hard X-ray sources appear later at the footpoints of the
flare loops formed under the rising flux rope. Possible implications of this
scenario for the theoretical interpretation of the forces driving sunquakes are
discussed.

exponent tau=1 for the SK model, originating from the marginal stability

N is the total number of spins. Our general formula also suggests that the
density of overlap q between initial and final state in an avalanche is rho(q)
~ 1/(1-q). These results show interesting similarities with numerical
simulations for the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the SK model. For
finite-range models, using droplet arguments, we obtain the prediction tau=
(d_f + theta)/d_m, where d_f,d_m and theta are the fractal dimension,
magnetization exponent and energy exponent of a droplet, respectively. This

spectrum found shows a number of peculiar features, which are absent in the
Minkowski space-time. A hypothetical particle that moves faster than light,
\emph{a tachyon}, is known to be classically unstable in the Minkowski
space-time. This instability has its analog at the quantum level: small vacuum
fluctuations of the field lead to the unbounded growth of the amplitude, so
that the appearance of the real tachyons in the spectrum means that there is
catastrophic instability in the theory. It has been conjectured a long time ago
that possibly the lightest particles with nonzero mass, the neutrino, may be a
tachyon. Here we shall show that in the rotating and expanding Universe
tachyons are stable if their mass is less than some constant, which is related
to the Universe's rotation and expansion scales. The current upper bound on the
rotation scale gives us a very small upper bound on the tachyon's mass which is
many orders less than the mass of the electron. This might explain why only
very light particles have the chance of becoming tachyons. It is shown that the

expansion, i.e. the vacuum condensates, of dimension $d = 2$, 4 and 6 are

are obtained which are compatible within errors with values from $\tau$-decay.
However, the rather large data uncertainties, together with the current value
of the strong coupling constant, lead to very large errors in the condensates.
It also appears that the separation into isovector and isoscalar pieces
introduces additional uncertainties and errors. In contrast, the high precision
$\tau$-decay data of the ALEPH collaboration in the vector channel allows for a
more precise determination of the condensates. This is in spite of QCD
asymptotics not quite been reached at the end of the $\tau$ spectrum. We point
out that isospin violation is negligible in the integrated cross sections,

was explored to model the motion of colloidal microswimmers,
catalytically-driven nanorods, and bacteria. Here, we generalize this
description to biaxial particles with arbitrary shape and derive the
corresponding Langevin equation for a self-propelled Brownian spinning top. The
biaxial swimmer is exposed to a hydrodynamic Stokes friction force at low
Reynolds numbers, to fluctuating random forces and torques as well as to an
external and an internal (effective) force and torque. The latter quantities
control its self-propulsion. Due to biaxiality and hydrodynamic
translational-rotational coupling, the Langevin equation can only be solved
numerically. In the special case of an orthotropic particle in the absence of
external forces and torques, the noise-free (zero-temperature) trajectory is
analytically found to be a circular helix. This trajectory is confirmed
numerically to be more complex in the general case involving a transient
irregular motion before ending up in a simple periodic motion. By contrast, if
the external force vanishes, no transient regime is found and the particle
moves on a superhelical trajectory. For orthotropic particles, the
noise-averaged trajectory is a generalized concho-spiral. We furthermore study
the reduction of the model to two spatial dimensions and classify the
noise-free trajectories completely finding circles, straight lines with and
without transients, as well as cycloids and arbitrary periodic trajectories.

as heat and moisture transport is strongly influenced by the uncertainty in
parameters. Such materials occur e.g. in historic buildings, and the durability
assessment of these therefore needs a reliable and probabilistic simulation of
transport processes, which is related to the suitable identification of
material parameters. In order to include expert knowledge as well as
experimental results, one can employ an updating procedure such as Bayesian
inference. The classical probabilistic setting of the identification process in
Bayes's form requires the solution of a stochastic forward problem via
computationally expensive sampling techniques, which makes the method almost
impractical. In this paper novel stochastic computational techniques such as
the stochastic Galerkin method are applied in order to accelerate the updating
procedure. The idea is to replace the computationally expensive forward
simulation via the conventional finite element (FE) method by the evaluation of
a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Such an approximation of the FE model for
the forward simulation perfectly suits the Bayesian updating. The presented
uncertainty updating techniques are applied to the numerical model of coupled
heat and moisture transport in heterogeneous materials with spatially varying
coefficients defined by random fields.

complementary to the RMT-models describing quantum dots. Firstly, it reproduces

dephasing at finite temperatures. Besides, the crossovers from open to almost

coupling operators in immersed solution methods for fluid-structure interaction

Method (IBM) or the Immersed Finite Element Method (IFEM), where Dirac-delta
distributions are approximated via smooth functions. By contrast, a truly
variational formulation of immersed methods does not require the use of
Dirac-delta distributions, either formally or practically. This has been shown
in the Finite Element Immersed Boundary Method (FEIBM), where the variational
structure of the problem is exploited to avoid Dirac-delta distributions at
both the continuous and the discrete level. In this paper, we generalize the
FEIBM to the case where an incompressible Newtonian fluid interacts with a
general hyperelastic solid. Specifically, we allow (i) the mass density to be
different in the solid and the fluid, (ii) the solid to be either viscoelastic
of differential type or purely elastic, and (iii) the solid to be and either
compressible or incompressible. At the continuous level, our variational
formulation combines the natural stability estimates of the fluid and
elasticity problems. In immersed methods, such stability estimates do not
transfer to the discrete level automatically due to the non- matching nature of
the finite dimensional spaces involved in the discretization. After presenting
our general mathematical framework for the solution of FSI problems, we focus
in detail on the construction of natural interpolation operators between the
fluid and the solid discrete spaces, which guarantee semi-discrete stability
estimates and strong consistency of our spatial discretization.

investigate the competition of strong electron correlations with proximity
effect. Depending whether local pairing or local magnetism prevails, a
superconducting quantum dot will respectively exhibit positive or negative
supercurrent, referred to as a 0 or $\pi$ Josephson junction. In the regime of
strong Coulomb blockade, the 0 to $\pi$ transition is typically controlled by a
change in the discrete charge state of the dot, from even to odd. In contrast,
at larger tunneling amplitude the Kondo effect develops for an odd charge
(magnetic) dot in the normal state, and quenches magnetism. In this situation,
we find that a first order 0 to $\pi$ quantum phase transition can be triggered
at fixed valence when superconductivity is brought in, due to the competition
of the superconducting gap and the Kondo temperature. The SQUID geometry
together with the tunability of our device allows the exploration of the
associated phase diagram predicted by recent theories. We also report on the
observation of anharmonic behavior of the current-phase relation in the
transition regime, that we associate with the two different accessible
superconducting states. Our results ultimately reveal the spin singlet nature
of the Kondo ground state, which is the key process in allowing the stability
of the 0-phase far from the mixed valence regime.

weight. These results are adapted to produce universally coupled massive

is the method of producing exposed side edge(s) of a tunnel junction for

method ensured that along the tunnel junction edges, the minimum gap between
the two metal electrodes equaled the thickness of the tunnel barrier. All of
the tunnel junction test beds used a ~2 nm alumina (AlOx) tunnel barrier. We
successfully bridged the magnetic organometallic molecular clusters and
non-magnetic alkane molecules across the AlOx insulator along the exposed
edges, to transform the prefabricated tunnel junction into the molecular
electronics or spintronics devices. Tunnel junction test beds were fabricated
with a variety of metal electrodes, such as NiFe, Co, Ni, Au, Ta, Cu and Si.
Stability of ultrathin thin AlOx varied with the type of bottom metal
electrodes used for making MEMED/MEMSD. Additionally, molecular solution used
for bridging molecular channels in a MEMED was not compatible with all the

this theorem was proven only for spin manifolds by E. Witten. Our proof is a

minimal hypersurfaces, we use marginally outer trapped hypersurfaces (MOTS)

gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores into protostars, and yet its
role in the star formation process is not well-studied. This thesis describes a
semianalytic self-similar model of the collapse of rotating isothermal
molecular cloud cores with both Hall and ambipolar diffusion, presenting
similarity solutions that demonstrate that the Hall effect has a profound
influence on the dynamics of collapse.
  ...
  Hall diffusion also determines the strength of the magnetic diffusion and
centrifugal shocks that bound the pseudo and rotationally-supported discs, and
can introduce subshocks that further slow accretion onto the protostar. In
cores that are not initially rotating Hall diffusion can even induce rotation,
which could give rise to disc formation and resolve the magnetic braking
catastrophe. The Hall effect clearly influences the dynamics of gravitational
collapse and its role in controlling the magnetic braking and radial diffusion
of the field would be worth exploring in future numerical simulations of star
formation.

  Nonextensive Tsallis Statistics",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The field of study of complex systems holds that the dynamics of complex
systems are founded on universal principles that may used to describe a great
variety of scientific and technological approaches of different types of
natural, artificial, and social systems. Authors have suggested that earthquake
dynamics and neurodynamics can be analyzed within similar mathematical
frameworks, a claim further supported by recent evidence. The purpose of this
paper is to suggest a shift in emphasis from the large to the small in the
search for a dynamical analogy between seizure and earthquake. Our analyses
focus on a single epileptic seizure generation and the activation of a single
fault (earthquake) and not on the statistics of sequences of different seizures
and earthquakes. A central property of the epileptic seizure / earthquake
generation is the occurrence of coherent large-scale collective behaviour with
very rich structure, resulting from repeated nonlinear interactions among the
constituents of the system, respectively firing neurons and opening cracks.
Consequently, in this paper, we apply the Tsallis nonextensive statistical
mechanics as it proves an appropriate framework in order to investigate
universal principles of their generation. For completeness reasons we also use
entropic measures as well as tools from information theory. The obtained
results seems to support the claim that epileptic seizures can be considered as
""quakes on the brain"".

secondary hadrons. These particles can be created from hadronization of the
parton(s), which possess the energy of grouped partons from coherent
interactions as a result of their collective behav- ior in high dense medium.
The medium might be formed in the centre of some massive stars, and it could be
a source of the super high-energy cosmic rays. In this work we consider some
experimental results as an evidence on collective phenomenon, that can lead to
coherent interactions in high dense medium and production of the high-energy
secondary hadrons.

  Potential","16 pages",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is here proposed a geometric approach for the problem of describing
entropy in a quantum system. We make use of an extension of tensor calculus
called morphogenetic calculus. By using such formalism we express the entropy
of a quantum system as the superposition of Boltzmann entropies. In this way we
also provide a reading of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Moreover we show that the Bohm quantum potential emerges as a consequence of
the classical equilibrium under the constraint of a minimum condition of Fisher
information. In this way, Bohm quantum potential appears as a non-Euclidean
deformation of the probabilistic space. Finally we investigate the possible
quantum-relativistic extensions of the theory and the connections with the
problem of quantum gravity.
