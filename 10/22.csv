Quantum Grav. 30 (2013) 085013 (28pp)",,,"gr-qc hep-th math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the discrete classical phase space of loop gravity,
which is expressed in terms of the holonomy-flux variables, and show how it is
related to the continuous phase space of general relativity. In particular, we
prove an isomorphism between the loop gravity discrete phase space and the
symplectic reduction of the continuous phase space with respect to a flatness
constraint. This gives for the first time a precise relationship between the
continuum and holonomy-flux variables. Our construction shows that the fluxes
depend on the three-geometry, but also explicitly on the connection, explaining
their non commutativity. It also clearly shows that the flux variables do not
label a unique geometry, but rather a class of gauge-equivalent geometries.
This allows us to resolve the tension between the loop gravity geometrical
interpretation in terms of singular geometry, and the spin foam interpretation
in terms of piecewise flat geometry, since we establish that both geometries
belong to the same equivalence class. This finally gives us a clear
understanding of the relationship between the piecewise flat spin foam
geometries and Regge geometries, which are only piecewise-linear flat: While
Regge geometry corresponds to metrics whose curvature is concentrated around
straight edges, the loop gravity geometry correspond to metrics whose curvature
is concentrated around not necessarily straight edges.

many pursuers, each with the same maximum speed as the evader, are necessary

always know the evader's current position through the camera network, but need
to physically reach the evader to capture it. We allow the evader the knowledge

standard worst-case analysis model, but also models a practical situation where

quantum-size effects opens a quasi-molecule channel in the fermionic pairing so
that the condensed pairs exhibit features typical of a molecular state. As an
illustration we consider a quasi-one-dimensional fermionic condensate, as
realized, e.g., in cigar-shaped atomic Fermi gases or superconducting quantum
wires. In this case the transverse quantization of the particle motion favors
pairing through a coherent superposition of quantum channels that are formed
due to the grouping of single-particle levels into a series of well
distinguished subbands. Whenever the bottom of a subband approaches the Fermi
level, the longitudinal spatial distribution of fermions in a condensed pair
becomes strongly localized within the corresponding quantum channel. The
fermionic pairs in this channel resemble molecules with bosonic character.

is the study of the spin of the nucleon in terms of its constituents, quarks
and gluons. COMPASS has accumulated data during 6 years scattering polarized
muons off a longitudinally or a transversely polarized deuteron (6LiD) or
proton (NH3) target. Results for the gluon polarization are obtained from
longitudinal double spin cross section asymmetries using two different
channels, open charm production and high transverse momentum hadron pairs, both
proceeding through the photon-gluon fusion process. Also, the longitudinal spin
structure functions of the proton and the deuteron were measured in parallel as
well as the helicity distributions for the three lightest quark flavors. With a
transversely polarized target, results were obtained with proton and deuteron
targets for the Collins and Sivers asymmetries for charged hadrons as well as
for identified kaons and pions. The Collins asymmetry is sensitive to the
transverse spin structure of the nucleon, while the Sivers asymmetry reflects
correlations between the quark transverse momentum and the nucleon spin.
Recently, a new proposal for the COMPASS II experiment was accepted by the CERN
SPS which includes two new topics: Exclusive reactions like DVCS and DVMP using
the muon beam and a hydrogen target to study generalized parton distributions

Kinematic studies of propagating jet features find an apparent speed
distribution that peaks around 10c for blazars, with speeds up to 50c observed.
These observed speeds require Lorentz factors at least as large, implying that
parsec-scale Lorentz factors up to 10-20 are common for blazars with a tail up
to ~ 50. Jet flows are still becoming organized on these scales as evidenced by
the high incidence of non-radial motions and/or accelerations of jet features
(including increases and decreases in apparent speed and direction). Changes in
Lorentz factors of propagating jet features appear to play a significant role
in the observed accelerations, and while the connection between acceleration of
jet features and the underlying flow is not clear, the pattern of observed
accelerations suggest the flow may increase in speed near the base of the jet
and decrease further out. In some jets, ejections of new features span a range
of ejection angles over many epochs, tracing out wider opening angles on
parsec-scales than are apparent in single epoch observations.

density-functional theory (DFT) and to our recent application of a
wavelet-based version of linear-response time-dependent DFT (LR-TD-DFT). Our
intended audience is quantum chemists and theoretical solid-state and chemical
physicists. Wavelets are a Fourier-transform-like approach which developed
primarily in the latter half of the last century and which was rapidly adapted
by engineers in the 1990s because of its advantages compared to standard
Fourier transform techniques for multiresolution problems with complicated
boundary conditions. High performance computing wavelet codes now also exist
for DFT applications in quantum chemistry and solid-state physics, notably the
BigDFT code described in this chapter. After briefly describing the basic
equations of DFT and LR-TD-DFT, we discuss how they are solved in BigDFT and
present new results on the small test molecule carbon monoxide to show how
BigDFT results compare against those obtained with the quantum chemistry
gaussian-type orbital (GTO) based code deMon2k. In general, the two programs
give essentially the same orbital energies, but the wavelet basis of BigDFT
converges to the basis set limit much more rapidly than does the GTO basis set
of deMon2k. Wavelet-based LR-TD-DFT is still in its infancy, but our
calculations confirm the feasibility of implementing LR-TD-DFT in a

community to be state of the art with regards to providing reliability in
distributed systems. BFT systems provide safety and liveness guarantees with
reasonable assumptions, amongst a set of nodes where at most f nodes display
arbitrarily incorrect behaviors, known as Byzantine faults. Despite this, BFT
systems are still rarely used in practice. In this paper we describe our
experience, from an application developer's perspective, trying to leverage the
publicly available and highly-tuned PBFT middleware (by Castro and Liskov), to
provide provable reliability guarantees for an electronic voting application
with high security and robustness needs. We describe several obstacles we
encountered and drawbacks we identified in the PBFT approach. These include
some that we tackled, such as lack of support for dynamic client management and
leaving state management completely up to the application. Others still
remaining include the lack of robust handling of non-determinism, lack of
support for web-based applications, lack of support for stronger cryptographic
primitives, and others. We find that, while many of the obstacles could be
overcome with a revised BFT middleware implementation that is tuned
specifically for the needs of the particular application, they require
significant engineering effort and time and their performance implications for
the end-application are unclear. An application developer is thus unlikely to
be willing to invest the time and effort to do so to leverage the BFT approach.
We conclude that the research community needs to focus on the usability of BFT
algorithms for real world applications, from the end-developer perspective, in
addition to continuing to improve the BFT middleware performance, robustness
and deployment layouts.

random updates of the coin states of the following form. The random sequences
of unitary updates are given by a site dependent function of a Markov chain in
time, with the following properties: on each site, they share the same
stationnary Markovian distribution and, for each fixed time, they form a
deterministic periodic pattern on the lattice.
  We prove a Feynman-Kac formula to express the characteristic function of the
averaged distribution over the randomness at time $n$ in terms of the nth power
of an operator $M$. By analyzing the spectrum of $M$, we show that this
distribution posesses a drift proportional to the time and its centered
counterpart displays a diffusive behavior with a diffusion matrix we compute.
Moderate and large deviations principles are also proven to hold for the
averaged distribution and the limit of the suitably rescaled corresponding
characteristic function is shown to satisfy a diffusion equation.
  An example of random updates for which the analysis of the distribution can
be performed without averaging is worked out. The random distribution displays
a deterministic drift proportional to time and its centered counterpart gives
rise to a random diffusion matrix whose law we compute. We complete the picture

fixed circular orbit of separation $a$. As in previous hydrodynamical
simulations, strong torques by the binary can maintain a gap of radius $\simeq
2a$. Streams curve inward from $r \simeq 2a$ toward the binary; some of their
mass passes through the inner boundary, while the remainder swings back out to
the disk. However, we also find that near its inner edge the disk develops both
a strong $m=1$ asymmetry and growing orbital eccentricity. Because the MHD
stresses introduce more matter into the gap, the total torque per unit disk
mass is $\simeq 14$ times larger than found previously. The inner boundary
accretion rate per unit disk mass is $\simeq 40$ times greater than found from
previous hydrodynamical calculations. The implied binary shrinkage rate is
determined by a balance between the rate at which the binary gains angular
momentum by accretion and loses it by gravitational torque. The large accretion
rate brings these two rates nearly into balance, but in net, we find that $\dot
a/a < 0$, and its magnitude is about 2.7 times larger than predicted by the
earlier hydrodynamic simulations. If the binary comprises two massive black
holes, the accretion rate may be great enough for one or both to be AGN, with
consequences for the physical state of the gas both in the disk body and in its
inner gap.

conversion at long baselines. Scanning the parameter space of sterile neutrino
matter effect fits of the LSND and MiniBooNe data, we show that in the case of
a vector singlet coupling of sterile neutrinos to matter, some favored
parametrizations of these fits would create neutral-current event excesses
above standard model predictions at long baseline experiments (e.g. MINOS and

spherical harmonic transforms (SHTs). Such transforms are ubiquitous in
astronomical data analysis. Our code performs substantially better than
existing publicly available codes due to improvements on two fronts. First, the
computational core is made more efficient by using small amounts of precomputed
data, as well as paying attention to CPU instruction pipelining and cache
usage. Second, Wavemoth makes use of a fast and numerically stable algorithm
based on compressing a set of linear operators in a precomputation step. The
resulting SHT scales as O(L^2 (log L)^2) for the resolution range of practical
interest, where L denotes the spherical harmonic truncation degree. For low and
medium-range resolutions, Wavemoth tends to be twice as fast as libpsht, which
is the current state of the art implementation for the HEALPix grid. At the
resolution of the Planck experiment, L ~ 4000, Wavemoth is between three and
six times faster than libpsht, depending on the computer architecture and the
required precision. Due to the experimental nature of the project, only
spherical harmonic synthesis is currently supported, although adding support or
spherical harmonic analysis should be trivial.

open-source license. It was designed for collisional dynamics such as planetary
rings but can also solve the classical N-body problem. It is highly modular and
can be customized easily to work on a wide variety of different problems in
astrophysics and beyond.
  REBOUND comes with three symplectic integrators: leap-frog, the symplectic
epicycle integrator (SEI) and a Wisdom-Holman mapping (WH). It supports open,
periodic and shearing-sheet boundary conditions. REBOUND can use a Barnes-Hut
tree to calculate both self-gravity and collisions. These modules are fully
parallelized with MPI as well as OpenMP. The former makes use of a static
domain decomposition and a distributed essential tree. Two new collision
detection modules based on a plane-sweep algorithm are also implemented. The
performance of the plane-sweep algorithm is superior to a tree code for
simulations in which one dimension is much longer than the other two and in
simulations which are quasi-two dimensional with less than one million
particles.
  In this work, we discuss the different algorithms implemented in REBOUND, the
philosophy behind the code's structure as well as implementation specific
details of the different modules. We present results of accuracy and scaling
tests which show that the code can run efficiently on both desktop machines and
large computing clusters.

a strongly polynomial algorithm for the case when all $C_{ij}$'s are convex
quadratic functions, settling an open problem raised e.g. by Hochbaum [1994].
We also give strongly polynomial algorithms for computing market equilibria in
Fisher markets with linear utilities and with spending constraint utilities,
that can be formulated in this framework (see Shmyrev [2009], Devanur et al.
[2011]). For the latter class this resolves an open question raised by Vazirani
[2010]. The running time is $O(m^4\log m)$ for quadratic costs,
$O(n^4+n^2(m+n\log n)\log n)$ for Fisher's markets with linear utilities and
$O(mn^3 +m^2(m+n\log n)\log m)$ for spending constraint utilities.
  All these algorithms are presented in a common framework that addresses the
general problem setting. Whereas it is impossible to give a strongly polynomial
algorithm for the general problem even in an approximate sense (see Hochbaum
[1994]), we show that assuming the existence of certain black-box oracles, one
can give an algorithm using a strongly polynomial number of arithmetic
operations and oracle calls only. The particular algorithms can be derived by
implementing these oracles in the respective settings.

transport measurements at low magnetic field are carried out in
a-few-$\mu\mathrm{m}$-wide Hall bars made of monolayer (ML) or bilayer (BL)
exfoliated graphene transferred on $\textrm{Si/SiO}_{2}$ substrate. From the
charge carrier density dependence of the conductivity and from the measurement
of the quantum corrections at low magnetic field, we deduce that transport
properties in these devices are mainly governed by the Coulomb interaction of
carriers with a large concentration of charged impurities. In the QHE regime,
at high magnetic field and low temperature ($T<1.3 \textrm{K}$), the Hall
resistance is measured by comparison with a GaAs based quantum resistance
standard using a cryogenic current comparator. In the low dissipation limit, it
is found quantized within 5 parts in $10^{7}$ (one standard deviation, $1
\sigma$) at the expected rational fractions of the von Klitzing constant,
respectively $R_{\mathrm{K}}/2$ and $R_{\mathrm{K}}/4$ in the ML and BL
devices. These results constitute the most accurate QHE quantization tests to
date in monolayer and bilayer exfoliated graphene. It turns out that a main
limitation to the quantization accuracy, which is found well above the
$10^{-9}$ accuracy usually achieved in GaAs, is the low value of the QHE
breakdown current being no more than $1 \mu\mathrm{A}$. The current dependence
of the longitudinal conductivity investigated in the BL Hall bar shows that
dissipation occurs through quasi-elastic inter-Landau level scattering,
assisted by large local electric fields. We propose that charged impurities are
responsible for an enhancement of such inter-Landau level transition rate and
cause small breakdown currents.

up to 20 per cent for r<1 Mpc/h. Similar results apply to power spectra and

formation of the Milky Way (MW), GCs were exposed to the likely evolving
potential of our Galaxy. The expulsion of the residual-gas from the GC's
embedded progenitors is sensitive to the conditions in the pre-MW gas cloud. By
means of N-body computations it is shown that gas throw-out from initially
mass-segregated GCs affect the shape of the low-mass stellar mass function (MF)
and that its imprint might still be visible in the present-day MF (PDMF). The
strength of the tidal-field at birth influences the degree of gas-expulsion
driven low-mass-star depletion and therefore the PDMF probes the MW potential
at the time of GC formation. It is argued that among the old GC population in
the MW, younger GCs show stronger low-mass-star loss than older GCs. This is
shown to be consistent with a contracting and self-gravitating cloud in which
fluctuations in the pre-MW potential grow with time. An initially relatively
smooth tidal field evolved into a grainy potential within a dynamical
time-scale of the collapsing cloud (based on Marks & Kroupa 2010, MNRAS, 406,

weak gravitational lensing by large scale structure. One consequence of this is
that the distance-redshift relation, in wide use for cosmological tests,
suffers lensing-induced scatter which can be quantified by the magnification
probability distribution. Predicting this distribution generally requires a
method for ray-tracing through cosmological N-body simulations. However,
standard methods tend to apply the multiple thin-lens approximation. In an
effort to quantify the accuracy of these methods, we develop an innovative code
that performs ray-tracing without the use of this approximation. The efficiency
and accuracy of this computationally challenging approach can be improved by
careful choices of numerical parameters; therefore, the results are analysed
for the behaviour of the ray-tracing code in the vicinity of Schwarzschild and
Navarro-Frenk-White lenses. Preliminary comparisons are drawn with the multiple
lens-plane ray-bundle method in the context of cosmological mass distributions
for a source redshift of $z_{s}=0.5$.

presence of extra heavy flavors of quarks, which substantially increase Higgs
production from gluon fusion over the Standard Model rate. However, if heavy
fourth generation neutrinos are less than half of the Higgs mass, they can
dominate the Higgs decay branching fraction, overtaking the standard Higgs to
WW* decay rate. The Higgs mass exclusion in a fourth generation scenario is
shown most generally to be 155-600 GeV, and is highly dependent on the fourth

be difficult to find. In pioneering work, Nussenzveig performed the analysis
for a square well/wall, and plotted the flow of the poles as the potential
depth/height varied. More than fifty years later, however, little has been done
in the way of direct generalization of those results. We point out that today
we can find such poles easily and efficiently, using numerical techniques and
widely available software. We study the poles of the scattering matrix for the

pieces. For the finite well/wall the flow of the poles as a function of the
depth/height recovers the results of Nussenzveig. We then analyze the flow for
a potential with two independent parts that can be attractive or repulsive, the
two-piece potential. These examples provide some insight into the complicated

size-dependent when the bulk material is reduced to the nanometer scale. Using
silver, the present study shows a remarkable emergent characteristic of
extensive properties as the size of the system is increased from a single atom
to bulk - the property (strength) evolves in a staircase manner, as opposed to
the intuitively assumed continuous approach to a saturating bulk value. In
other words, the observed variation with size retains the inherent trait of
intensive properties in the form of size-independent staircase plateaus. The
steps can be explained by simple and necessary geometric configurations that
atoms must assume in their initial approach to bulk. Were it not for these
observations, it would have been remarkable to have reported that the observed
strength in the limit of a single-atom Ag bridge approaches the theoretical
limit, being 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than in bulk single crystals. The
appearance of steps is acutely sensitive to minute perturbations, and their
observation is enabled by pico-level resolution in measured forces and
displacements in highly stable atomic sized bridges. However, suitably
harnessed, results open the possibility to impart vastly different strengths to
the same material based only on its size. This combined with possibility to
change the position and height of the steps by mixing elements of different
diameters and surface energy, opens a realistic approach to 'materials by
design'. Results also provide an example of the evolutionary trace of an
emergent physical property in materials.

larger numbers of neurons. As a result there is increasing interest in the
structure of cooperative -- or correlated -- activity in neural populations,
and in the possible impact of such correlations on the neural code. A
fundamental theoretical challenge is to understand how the architecture of
network connectivity along with the dynamical properties of single cells shape
the magnitude and timescale of correlations. We provide a general approach to
this problem by extending prior techniques based on linear response theory. We
consider networks of general integrate-and-fire cells with arbitrary
architecture, and provide explicit expressions for the approximate
cross-correlation between constituent cells. These correlations depend strongly
on the operating point (input mean and variance) of the neurons, even when
connectivity is fixed. Moreover, the approximations admit an expansion in
powers of the matrices that describe the network architecture. This expansion
can be readily interpreted in terms of paths between different cells. We apply
our results to large excitatory-inhibitory networks, and demonstrate first how
precise balance --- or lack thereof --- between the strengths and timescales of
excitatory and inhibitory synapses is reflected in the overall correlation
structure of the network. We then derive explicit expressions for the average
correlation structure in randomly connected networks. These expressions help to

several different measures of the spectral index, and persists even when
restricting the samples to only include compact objects. Because radio spectral

often observed farther from the jet axis compared to normal quasars.

is accreted through the supernova shock. The second mechanism is related to the
impact of the supersonic wind termination shock (reverse shock) within the
tumultuous inner regions of the ejecta above the proto-neutron star. Our
results suggest that isotopes in the mass range 12<=A<=122 that are produced
during the freeze-out expansions may be classified in two families. The
isotopes of the first family manifest a common mass fraction evolutionary
profile, whose specific shape per isotope depends on the characteristic
transition between two equilibrium states (equilibrium state transition) during
each type of freeze-out expansion. The first family includes the majority of
isotopes in this mass range. The second family is limited to magic nuclei and
isotopes in their locality, which do not sustain any transition, become nuclear
flow hubs, and dominate the final composition. We use exponential and power-law
adiabatic profiles to identify dynamic large-scale and small-scale equilibrium
patterns among nuclear reactions. (truncated abstract) In addition, we
introduce non-monotonic parameterized profiles to probe the impact of the
reverse shock and multi-dimensional explosion asymmetries on nucleosynthesis.
Cases are shown in which the non-monotonic profiles favor the production of
radioactivities. Non-monotonic freeze-out profiles involve longer
non-equilibrium nucleosynthesis intervals compared with the exponential and
power-law profiles, resulting in mass fraction trends and yield distributions
that may not be achieved by the monotonic freeze-out profiles.

Kronecker Graph (SKG) model has been chosen by the Graph500 steering committee
to create supercomputer benchmarks for graph algorithms. The major reasons for
this are its easy parallelization and ability to mirror real data. Although SKG
is easy to implement, there is little understanding of the properties and
behavior of this model.
  We show that the parallel variant of the edge-configuration model given by
Chung and Lu (referred to as CL) is notably similar to the SKG model. The graph
properties of an SKG are extremely close to those of a CL graph generated with
the appropriate parameters. Indeed, the final probability matrix used by SKG is
almost identical to that of a CL model. This implies that the graph
distribution represented by SKG is almost the same as that given by a CL model.
We also show that when it comes to fitting real data, CL performs as well as
SKG based on empirical studies of graph properties. CL has the added benefit of
a trivially simple fitting procedure and exactly matching the degree
distribution. Our results suggest that users of the SKG model should consider
the CL model because of its similar properties, simpler structure, and ability
to fit a wider range of degree distributions. At the very least, CL is a good
control model to compare against.

between ionization potential and electron affinity - and the exciton binding
energy - inferred from the difference between the transport and optical
absorption gaps. Transport gaps are commonly established via photoemission and
inverse photoemission spectroscopy (PES/IPES). However, PES and IPES are
surface-sensitive, average over a dynamic lattice, and are subject to extrinsic
effects, leading to significant uncertainty in gaps. Here, we use density
functional theory and many-body perturbation theory to calculate the
spectroscopic properties of two prototypical organic semiconductors, pentacene
and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), quantitatively
comparing with measured PES, IPES, and optical absorption spectra. For bulk
pentacene and PTCDA, the computed transport gaps are 2.4 and 3.0 eV, and
optical gaps are 1.7 and 2.1 eV, respectively. Computed bulk quasiparticle
spectra are in excellent agreement with surface-sensitive photoemission
measurements over several eV only if the measured gap is reduced by 0.6 eV for
pentacene, and 0.6-0.9 eV for PTCDA. We attribute this redshift to several
physical effects, including incomplete charge screening at the surface, static
and dynamical disorder, and experimental resolution. Optical gaps are in
excellent agreement with experiment, with solid-state exciton binding energies
of ~0.5 eV for both systems; for pentacene, the exciton is delocalized over
several molecules and exhibits significant charge transfer character. Our
parameter-free calculations provide new interpretation of spectroscopic

(2) the intrinsic distributions of the jet-corrected luminosity ($L_{\rm

BAT, the probabilities of a GRB jet pointing to the instrument solid angle and
the probability of redshift measurement. Our results well reproduce the
observed $\theta_{\rm j}-z$ dependence. We find that in case of

Caldeira-Leggett model of the harmonic-oscillator bath, a detailed and
elementary derivation of the bath-induced stochastic field is presented. The
dynamics of the system is thereby fully described by a stochastic differential
equation and the desired master equation would be acquired with statistical
averaging. It is shown that the existence of a closed-form master equation
depends on the specificity of the system as well as the feature of the
dissipation characterized by the spectral density function. For a dissipative
harmonic oscillator it is observed that the correlation between the stochastic
field due to the bath and the system can be decoupled and the master equation
naturally comes out. Such an equation possesses the Lindblad form in which time
dependent coefficients are determined by a set of integral equations. It is
proved that the obtained master equation is equivalent to the well-known
Hu-Paz-Zhang equation based on the path integral technique. The procedure is
also used to obtain the master equation of a dissipative harmonic oscillator in

matter from the progenitor in its pre-supernova phase, and assumed to be
axially symmetric: more matter around the equator than in the polar direction
driven by rotation of the progenitor. Because of high density of the CSM, the
ionization state of the shock-heated ejecta quickly becomes equilibrium with
the electron temperature. When the blast wave breaks out of the CSM into the
rarefied ISM, the shocked ejecta cools rapidly due to adiabatic expansion, and
hence an over-ionized/recombining plasma would be left. The ejecta is reheated
by the second reverse shock due to the interaction with the ISM. We calculate
the emission measure of the supernova remnant (SNR) along the line of sight,
and find that the over-ionized plasma appears to be bar-like with wings in the
edge-on (equatorial view), while shell-like in the face-on (polar view)
geometry with respect to the rotation axis. The hot gas heated by the blast
wave exists in the outermost region of the SNR with a nearly complete shell,
but the X-rays therefrom are too faint to be observable. Thus, depending on the
viewing angle, the SNR of the over-ionized plasma would exhibit center-filled
morphology in X-rays, like W49B, a mixed-morphology SNR. The bar-like structure
is swept out by the second reverse shock and disappears eventually, and then
the SNR becomes shell-like in both the equatorial and polar views in the later

hierarchical stellar system moving in the field of stars have been studied.
Triple hierarchical stellar systems are stable in contrary to the stellar
systems with comparable distances between all components. We considered the
motion in the frame of the general tree-body problem using differential
equations of the motion with the Hamiltonian without short-periodic terms.
  For isolated triple stellar systems, where we took into account the
perturbations until the third order, we obtained the solution in which the mean
motions of both components have the secular accelerations. Under the influence
of perturbations of the distant component the mean motion in the near pair is
slowed and vice versa. The mean motion of the distant star is constantly
increasing. These changes are small, but on the cosmological time interval the
hierarchical systems will convert into stellar systems, in which all components
have comparable distances between each other. Such systems become unstable.
  In a general case, if we take into account the irregular forces, the angular
momentum of this system and its summary energy might be either loss or gain.
These changes may influence on the dynamical evolution and stability of the
stellar system.

the surface of Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ to be correlated with
interstitial O defects. We treat the problem in a slave boson mean field theory
of a disordered $t-t^{\prime}-J$ model, and identify three aspects of the O
defects related to the inhomogeneity: (1)the superexchange interaction is
locally enhanced in their vicinity, which enhances the local pairing gap and
reduces the coherence peak; (2)they donate holes into CuO$_2$ plane, which
reduces the spinon density of states of and hence the average gap at large
doping; (3)holes are locally attracted to the vicinity of oxygen defects, which
causes impurity bound state and further reduces the coherence peak. The
interplay of these mechanisms explains simultaneously the locally enhanced
pairing gap around oxygen defects, and the reduction of average gap as
increasing oxygen concentration.

states that graphs with the same degree sequence may be changed into each other

class of a graph, then it must take place in one of four configurations. We
also present a sufficient condition for a 2-switch to change the isomorphism
class of a graph. As consequences, we give a new characterization of matrogenic

Prolog program of practical importance (the SAT solver of Howe and King). The
program is treated as a definite clause logic program with added control. The
logic program is constructed by means of stepwise refinement, hand in hand with
its correctness and completeness proofs. The proofs are declarative - they do
not refer to any operational semantics. Each step of the logic program
construction follows a systematic approach to constructing programs which are
provably correct and complete. We also prove that correctness and completeness
of the logic program is preserved in the final Prolog program. Additionally, we
prove termination, occur-check freedom and non-floundering.
  Our example shows how dealing with ""logic"" and with ""control"" can be
separated. Most of the proofs can be done at the ""logic"" level, abstracting
from any operational semantics.
  The example employs approximate specifications; they are crucial in
simplifying reasoning about logic programs. It also shows that the paradigm of
semantics-preserving program transformations may be not sufficient. We suggest
considering transformations which preserve correctness and completeness with
respect to an approximate specification.

shrinks the electron (hole) s-wave function of a donor or an acceptor and this
reduces the overlap between hopping sites resulting in the positive
magnetoresistance quadratic in a weak magnetic field, B. We extend the theory
of hopping magnetoresistance to states with nonzero orbital momenta. Different
from s-states, a weak magnetic field expands the electron (hole) wave functions
with positive magnetic quantum numbers, m > 0, and shrinks the states with
negative m in a wide region outside the point defect. This together with a
magnetic-field dependence of injection/ionization rates results in a negative
weak-field magnetoresistance, which is linear in B when the orbital degeneracy
is lifted. The theory provides a possible explanation of a large low-field
magnetoresistance in disordered pi-conjugated organic materials (OMAR).

significant attention was paid to analyzing network failures caused by hardware
faults or overload, where the network reaction was modeled as rerouting of
traffic away from failed or congested elements. Here we model another type of
the network reaction to congestion -- a sharp reduction of the input traffic
rate through congested routes which occurs on much shorter time scales. We
consider the onset of congestion in the Internet where local mismatch between
demand and capacity results in traffic losses and show that it can be described
as a phase transition characterized by strong non-Gaussian loss fluctuations at
a mesoscopic time scale. The fluctuations, caused by noise in input traffic,
are exacerbated by the heterogeneous nature of the network manifested in a
scale-free load distribution. They result in the network strongly overreacting
to the first signs of congestion by significantly reducing input traffic along
the communication paths where congestion is utterly negligible.

networks (WSNs) using quantized sensor measurements under limited bandwidth
availability. At each time step of tracking, the available bandwidth $R$ needs
to be distributed among the $N$ sensors in the WSN for the next time step. The
optimal solution for the bandwidth allocation problem can be obtained by using
a combinatorial search which may become computationally prohibitive for large
$N$ and $R$. Therefore, we develop two new computationally efficient suboptimal
bandwidth distribution algorithms which are based on convex relaxation and
approximate dynamic programming (A-DP). We compare the mean squared error (MSE)
and computational complexity performances of convex relaxation and A-DP with
other existing suboptimal bandwidth distribution schemes based on generalized
Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (GBFOS) algorithm and greedy search.
Simulation results show that, A-DP, convex optimization and GBFOS yield similar
MSE performance, which is very close to that based on the optimal exhaustive
search approach and they outperform greedy search and nearest neighbor based
bandwidth allocation approaches significantly. Computationally, A-DP is more
efficient than the bandwidth allocation schemes based on convex relaxation and
GBFOS, especially for a large sensor network.
