planetary nebulae (PNs) and PN candidates. In previous studies of GLIMPSE I& II
data, we have shown that these MIR data are very useful in distinguishing PNs
from other emission-line objects. In the present paper, we focus on the PNs in
the field of the GLIMPSE 3D survey, which has a more extensive latitude
coverage. We found a total of 90 Macquarie-AAO-Strasbourg (MASH) and MASH II
PNs and 101 known PNs to have visible MIR counterparts in the GLIMPSE 3D survey
area. The images and photometry of these PNs are presented. Combining the
derived IRAC photometry at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 um with the existing photometric
measurements from other infrared catalogs, we are able to construct spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of these PNs. Among the most notable objects in
this survey is the PN M1-41, whose GLIMPSE 3D image reveals a large bipolar
structure of more than 3 arcmin in extent.

the post-genomic era. Many algorithms address this problem as a binary
classification problem: given two proteins represented as two vectors of
features, predict if they interact or not. Importantly however, computational
predictions are only one component of a larger framework for identifying PPI.
The most promising candidate pairs can be validated experimentally by testing
if they physical bind to each other. Since these experiments are more costly
and error prone, the computational predictions serve as a filter, aimed to
produce a small number of highly promising candidates. Here we propose to
address this problem as a ranking problem: given a network with known
interactions, rank all unknown pairs based on the likelihood of their
interactions.
  In this paper we propose a ranking algorithm that trains multiple
inter-connected models using a passive aggressive on-line approach. We show
good results predicting protein-protein interactions for post synaptic density
PPI network. We compare the precision of the ranking algorithm with local
classifiers and classic support vector machine. Though the ranking algorithm
outperforms the classic SVM classification, its performance is inferior
compared to the local supervised method.

model arises from a trade-off between its prior distribution and the
conditional likelihood of observed data. Such distribution functions usually
rely on additional hyperparameters which need to be tuned in order to achieve
optimum predictive performance; this operation can be efficiently performed in
an Empirical Bayes fashion by maximizing the posterior marginal likelihood of
the observed data. Since the score function of this optimization problem is in
general characterized by the presence of local optima, it is necessary to
resort to global optimization strategies, which require a large number of
function evaluations. Given that the evaluation is usually computationally
intensive and badly scaled with respect to the dataset size, the maximum number
of observations that can be treated simultaneously is quite limited. In this
paper, we consider the case of hyperparameter tuning in Gaussian process
regression. A straightforward implementation of the posterior log-likelihood
for this model requires O(N^3) operations for every iteration of the
optimization procedure, where N is the number of examples in the input dataset.
We derive a novel set of identities that allow, after an initial overhead of
O(N^3), the evaluation of the score function, as well as the Jacobian and
Hessian matrices, in O(N) operations. We prove how the proposed identities,
that follow from the eigendecomposition of the kernel matrix, yield a reduction
of several orders of magnitude in the computation time for the hyperparameter
optimization problem. Notably, the proposed solution provides computational
advantages even with respect to state of the art approximations that rely on
sparse kernel matrices.

effectively depend on a strong assumption of factorizability of the matter

addition to a phase with no loops, we find two phases with only one species of
loop proliferated. The model has a self-dual line, a segment of which separates
these two phases. Everywhere on the segment, we find the transition to be
first-order, signifying that the two loop systems behave as immiscible fluids
when they are both trying to condense. Moving further along the self-dual line,
we find a phase where both loops proliferate, but they are only of even
strength, and therefore avoid the statistical interactions. We study another
model which does not have this phase, and also find first-order behavior on the
self-dual segment.

homogeneous ensemble composed of only subthreshold neurons (which cannot fire
spontaneously without noise). By increasing the fraction of (spontaneously
firing) suprathreshold neurons $P_{supra}$, heterogeneity-induced inhibitory
coherence is investigated in a heterogeneous ensemble of subthreshold and
suprathreshold neurons. As $P_{supra}$ passes a threshold $P_{supra}^*$,
suprathreshold neurons begin to synchronize and play the role of coherent
inhibitors for the emergence of inhibitory coherence. Thus,
regularly-oscillating ensemble-averaged global potential appears for $P_{supra}
> P_{supra}^*$. For this coherent case suprathreshold neurons exhibit coherent
mixed-mode oscillations with a fast subthreshold (small-amplitude) hopping
frequency and a lower spiking frequency. By virtue of their coherent
inhibition, sparsely synchronized suprathreshold neurons suppress noisy
activities of subthreshold neurons. Thus, only coherent subthreshold hoppings
appear in the individual potentials of subthreshold neurons. We also
characterize the inhibitory coherence in terms of the ""statistical-mechanical""
spike-based and correlation-based measures and find that the degree of
inhibitory coherence increases with increasing $P_{supra}$ for $P_{supra} >

For this quasiperiodically forced case, a new type of strange nonchaotic (SN)

bursting state. This is in contrast to the periodically forced case where the
silent state transforms directly to a chaotic bursting state. Using a rational
approximation to the quasiperiodic forcing, the mechanism for the appearance of
such an SN bursting state is investigated. Thus, a smooth torus (corresponding
to a silent state) is found to transform to an SN bursting attractor through a
phase-dependent subcritical period-doubling bifurcation. These SN bursting
states, together with chaotic bursting states, are characterized in terms of
the interburst interval, the bursting length, and the number of spikes in each
burst. Both bursting states are found to be aperiodic complex ones.
Consequently, aperiodic complex burstings may result from two dynamically
different states with strange geometry (one is chaotic and the other one is
nonchaotic). Thus, in addition to chaotic burstings, SN burstings may become a
dynamical origin for complex physiological rhythms which are ubiquitous in
organisms.

measuring qubits -- two-dimensional quantum systems. Yet, in practical
realizations and experiments, the measuring devices at the receiver's (Bob)
site commonly do not measure a two-dimensional system but rather a quantum
space of a larger dimension. Such an enlargement sometimes results from
imperfect devices. However, in various QKD protocols such enlargement exists
even in the ideal scenario when all devices are assumed to be perfect. This
issue is common, for instance, in QKD schemes implemented via photons, where
the parties' devices are based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers, as these
inherently enlarge the quantum space in use.
  We show how space enlargement at Bob's site exposes the implemented protocol
to new kinds of attacks, attacks that have not yet been explicitly pinpointed
nor rigorously analyzed. We name these the ""reversed space attacks"". A key
insight in formalizing our attacks, is the idea of taking all states defining
Bob's (large) measured space and reversing them in time in order to identify
precisely the space that an eavesdropper may attack. We employ such attacks on
two variants of intereferometric-based QKD recently experimented by several
groups, and show how to get full information on the qubit sent by Alice, while
inducing no errors at all. The technique we develop here has subsequently been
used in a closely related work (Boyer, Gelles, and Mor, Physical Review A,
2014) to demonstrate a (weaker variant of) reversed-space attack on both
interferometric-based and polarization-based QKD.

supergiant stars. They are very rare, as only $\sim50$ are actually known in

product of two white dwarfs and could therefore be an important tool to
understand Supernovae type Ia in the double degenerate scenario. Constraints on
the spatial distribution and the formation rate of such stars are needed to
picture their origin and test it in the context of actual population synthesis
results. To do so, it is crucial to increase significantly the number of known
RCBs. With an absolute magnitude $\mathrm{M_V\sim-5}$ and a bright/hot
circumstellar shell made of amorphous carbon grains, RCBs are really
distinctive stars. Mono-epoch mid-infrared data can help us to discriminate
RCBs among other dust-producing stars. The aim is to produce from the WISE and
2MASS infrared catalogues a new catalogue of reasonable size, enriched with RCB
stars. Colour-Colour cuts used on all stars detected are the main selection
criteria. The selection efficiency was monitored using the 52 known RCBs. It
has been found that selection cuts in mid-infrared colour-colour diagrams are a
very efficient method of discriminating RCBs from other stars. An RCB enriched
catalogue made of only 1602 stars, with a high detection efficiency of about
77%, was produced. Spectral energy distributions of 49 known RCBs and 5 known
HdCs are also presented with estimates of their photosphere and circumstellar
shell temperatures. The newly released WISE all sky catalogue has proven to be
a valuable resource in finding RCB stars. Actual scenarios predict that between
100 and 500 RCBs exist in our Galaxy. The newly created RCB enriched catalogue
is an important step forward to significantly increase the number of known RCB
stars and therefore better understand their origin.

while quantum information science asks for the existence and construction of
certain Hamiltonians for given ground states. In practical situations, one
would be mainly interested in local Hamiltonians with certain interaction
patterns, such as nearest neighbour interactions on some type of lattices. A
necessary condition for a space $V$ to be the ground-state space of some local
Hamiltonian with a given interaction pattern, is that the maximally mixed state
supported on $V$ is uniquely determined by its reduced density matrices
associated with the given pattern, based on the principle of maximum entropy.
However, it is unclear whether this condition is in general also sufficient. We
examine the situations for the existence of such a local Hamiltonian to have
$V$ satisfying the necessary condition mentioned above as its ground-state
space, by linking to faces of the convex body of the local reduced states. We
further discuss some methods for constructing the corresponding local
Hamiltonians with given interaction patterns, mainly from physical points of
view, including constructions related to perturbation methods, local
frustration-free Hamiltonians, as well as thermodynamical ensembles.

our constructions is the use of the so called Wozencraft ensemble of linear
codes. Specifically, we obtain the following results.
  We give an explicit construction of a two-write Write-Once-Memory (WOM for
short) code that approaches capacity, over the binary alphabet. More formally,
for every \epsilon>0, 0<p<1 and n =(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/p\epsilon)} we give a
construction of a two-write WOM code of length n and capacity
H(p)+1-p-\epsilon. Since the capacity of a two-write WOM code is max_p
(H(p)+1-p), we get a code that is \epsilon-close to capacity. Furthermore,
encoding and decoding can be done in time O(n^2.poly(log n)) and time
O(n.poly(log n)), respectively, and in logarithmic space.
  We obtain a new encoding scheme for 3-write WOM codes over the binary
alphabet. Our scheme achieves rate 1.809-\epsilon, when the block length is
exp(1/\epsilon). This gives a better rate than what could be achieved using
previous techniques.
  We highlight a connection to linear seeded extractors for bit-fixing sources.
In particular we show that obtaining such an extractor with seed length O(log
n) can lead to improved parameters for 2-write WOM codes. We then give an
application of existing constructions of extractors to the problem of designing
encoding schemes for memory with defects.

parameters (e.g. age, mass, and distance) of differentially-reddened, pre-main
sequence-rich star clusters. It involves simulating conditions related to the
early-cluster phases, in particular the differential and foreground reddenings,
and internal age spread. Given the loose constraints imposed by these factors,
the derivation of parameters based only on photometry may be uncertain,
especially for the poorly-populated clusters. We consider a wide range of
cluster {\em (i)} mass and {\em (ii)} age, and different values of {\em (iii)}
distance modulus, {\em (iv)} differential and {\em (v)} foreground reddenings.
Photometric errors and their relation with magnitude are also taken into
account. We also investigate how the presence of unresolved binaries affect the
derived parameters. For each set of {\em (i)} - {\em (v)} we build the
corresponding model Hess diagram, and compute the root mean squared residual
with respect to the observed Hess diagram. The parameters that produce the
minimum residuals between model and observed Hess diagrams are searched by
exploring the full parameter space of {\em (i)} - {\em (v)} by means of {\em
brute force}, which may be time consuming but efficient. Control tests show
that an adequate convergence is achieved allowing for solutions with residuals
10% higher than the absolute minimum. Compared to a colour-magnitude diagram
containing only single stars, the presence of 100% of unresolved binaries has
little effect on cluster age, foreground and differential reddenings;
significant differences show up in the cluster mass and distance from the Sun.
Our approach shows to be successful in minimising the subjectiveness when
deriving fundamental parameters of young star clusters.

two distinct jet features in East-West direction with a separation of around 4
kpc. The Eastern feature, which has so far been assumed to hide the core, is a
kpc-scale hot spot, which is completely resolved out in the EVN image. In the
western jet feature, we find a compact jet component, which pinpoints the
position of the central black hole in the galaxy. Jet components on both sides
of the core are additionally detected in the Northwest-Southeast direction, and
they show a symmetric morphology on scale of <1 kpc. This two-sided jet feature
is not common in the known BAL quasars and indicates that the jet axis is far
away from the line of sight. Furthermore, it is nearly parallel to the
scattering plane revealed earlier by optical polarimetry. By analogy to
polar-scattered Seyfert 1 galaxies, we conclude that the jet likely has a
viewing angle around 45 degree. The analogy is further supported by the recent

  The solar chromosphere, in contrast, remains ill-understood although its
pivotal role in coronal mass and energy loading makes it a principal research
area. Its fine structure defines its overall structure, so that hard-to-observe
and hard-to-model small-scale dynamical processes are the key to understanding.
However, both chromospheric observation and chromospheric simulation presently
mature towards the required sophistication. The open-field features seem of
greater interest than the easier-to-see closed-field features.

devices from concepts to practical use is the non-unit magnetic permeability
generally required from a mathematical transformation. Simple renormalization
of permeability, as used in many previous designs and experiments, introduces
impedance mismatch and thus degrades the functional photonic performance. Here
we propose an area-preserving affine coordinate transformation as a general
method to solve this problem. Ideal transformation-optics functions can be
preserved while nonmagnetism is achieved. As a specific example, we illustrate
how to apply this affine method into the design of a two-dimensional
electromagnetic beam bending adapter. Concerns related to fabrication, such as
anisotropy degree and bending angles, are fully discussed. Our study is a
significant step toward practical use of ideal transformation optics devices
that can be implemented directly with existing dielectric materials.

The self-annihilation of WIMPs in astrophysical regions of high DM density can
produce secondary particles, including very high energy (VHE) gamma rays, with
energies up to the dark matter particle mass. The VERITAS array of Cherenkov
telescopes, designed for the detection of VHE gamma rays in the 100 GeV-10 TeV
energy range, is an appropriate instrument for the detection of DM and is
complementary to Fermi-LAT. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local

Michaelis-Menten reaction embedded in large open chemical reaction networks is
a popular model reduction technique in deterministic and stochastic simulations
of biochemical reactions inside cells. It is frequently assumed that the
predictions of the reduced master equations obtained using the stochastic
quasi-steady-state approach are in very good agreement with the predictions of
the full master equations, provided the conditions for the validity of the
deterministic quasi-steady-state approximation are fulfilled. We here use the
linear-noise approximation to show that this assumption is not generally
justified for the Michaelis-Menten reaction with substrate input, the simplest
example of an open embedded enzyme reaction. The reduced master equation
approach is found to considerably overestimate the size of intrinsic noise at
low copy numbers of molecules. A simple formula is obtained for the relative
error between the predictions of the reduced and full master equations for the
variance of the substrate concentration fluctuations. The maximum error is
reached when modeling moderately or highly efficient enzymes, in which case the
error is approximately 30%. The theoretical predictions are validated by
stochastic simulations using experimental parameter values for enzymes involved
in proteolysis, gluconeogenesis and fermentation.
