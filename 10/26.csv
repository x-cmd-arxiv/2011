zero temperature ultra-relativistic Fermi gas based on generalized uncertainty
principle (GUP), the quantum gravitational effects on the cores of compact
stars are discussed. Our results show that ${2m(r)}/ {r}$ varies with $r$.
Quantum gravity plays an important role in the region $ r\sim 10^3 r_0$, where
$r_0\sim \beta_0 l_p $, $l_p$ is the Planck length and $\beta_0$ is a
dimensionless parameter accounting for quantum gravity effects. Furthermore,
near the center of compact stars, we find that the metric components are
$g_{tt}\sim r^4$ and $g_{rr}=[1-{r}^2/(6r_0^2)]^{-1}$. All these effects are
different from those obtained from classical gravity. These results can be
applied to neutron stars or denser ones like quark stars. The observed masses
of neutron stars ($\leq 2M_\odot$) indicate that $\beta_0$ can not exceed
$10^{37}$, not as good as the upper bound $\beta_0<10^{34}$ from simple
electroweak consideration. This means that incorporating either quantum gravity
effects or nuclear interactions, one obtains almost the same mass limits of
neutron stars.

increasingly higher triggering speeds, thus fostering their use in several
fields, prominently in the recent area of Quantum Key Distribution. To reduce
the probability of an afterpulse, these detectors are usually equipped with a
circuitry that disables the trigger for a certain time after a positive
detection event, known as dead time. If the acquisition system connected to the
detector is not properly designed, efficiency issues arise when the triggering
rate is faster than the inverse of detector's dead-time. Moreover, when this
happens with two or more detectors used in coincidence, a security risk called
""self-blinding"" can jeopardize the distribution of a secret quantum key. In
this paper we introduce a trigger-disabling circuitry based on an FPGA-driven
feedback loop, so to avoid the above-mentioned inconveniences. In the regime of
single-photon-attenuated light, the electronics dynamically accept a trigger
only after detectors' complete recovery from dead-time. This technique proves
useful to work with detectors at their maximum speed and to increase the
security of a quantum key distribution setup.

determined the requirements for a single-shot non-destructive dispersive

""electromagnetic environment"" is necessary for a dispersive readout and can be
achieved if the whole system interacts with the external fields only through
the resonator that is weakly coupled to the qubit. A set of inequalities
involving resonator-qubit detuning and coupling parameter, the resonator
leakage and the measurement time, together with the requirement of multi-photon
outgoing flux is derived. It is shown, in particular, that a decrease of the
measurement time requires an increase of the resonator leakage. This increase
results in reducing the quality factor and decreasing the resolution of the

snowlines of oxygen- and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbon
monoxide, will result in systematic variations in the C/O ratio both in the gas

most oxygen is present in icy grains - the building blocks of planetary cores
in the core accretion model - while most carbon remains in the gas-phase. This
region is coincidental with the giant-planet forming zone for a range of
observed protoplanetary disks. Based on standard core accretion models of
planet formation, gas giants that sweep up most of their atmospheres from disk
gas outside of the water snowline will have C/O?1, while atmospheres
significantly contaminated by evaporating planetesimals will have stellar or
sub-stellar C/O when formed at the same disk radius. The overall metallicity
will also depend on the atmosphere formation mechanism, and exoplanetary

requirements-driven selection occupies a prominent place. A comprehensive
selection process needs to check compliance of Non-Functional Requirements
(NFR), which can be assessed by analysing WS Quality of Service (QoS). In this
paper, we describe the WeSSQoS system that aims at ranking available WS based
on the comparison of their QoS and the stated NFRs. WeSSQoS is designed as an
open service-oriented architecture that hosts a configurable portfolio of
normalization and ranking algorithms that can be selected by the engineer when
starting a selection process. WS' QoS can be obtained either from a static,
WSDL-like description, or computed dynamically through monitoring techniques.
WeSSQoS is designed to work over multiple WS repositories and QoS sources. The
impact of having a portfolio of different normalization and ranking algorithms
is illustrated with an example.

their evolution is analogous to coupled harmonic oscillators). After having
highlighted the intimate connection between controllability and recurrence in

spectroscopically measure the H alpha emission from 41 massive (M_{*}>10^{10.5}
Msol) galaxies taken from the POWIR Survey with spectroscopic redshifts
0.4<z_{spec}<1.4. We correct our H alpha fluxes for dust extinction by using
multi-wavelength data, and investigate SFR trends with mass and colour. We find
a drop in the fraction of massive galaxies with M_{*}>10^{11} Msol which are
detected in H alpha emission at z<0.9. We furthermore find that the fraction of
galaxies with H alpha emission drops steadily and significantly with redder
(U-B) colours at z~1, and that the SSFR drops with increasing (U-B) colour for
galaxies at all masses. By investigating the SFR-mass relation we find that the
SFR is roughly constant with mass, in possible contrast to previous work, and
that the specific star formation rate (SSFR) is lower in the most massive
galaxies. The scatter in the SFR vs. mass relationship is very small for those
systems with ongoing star formation which suggests that star formation in the
most massive galaxies at z~1 shuts off rather abruptly over <1 Gyr, without an
obvious gradual decline. We furthermore investigate the SFR as a function of
(U-B) colour divided into different mass bins, revealing a tracer of the epoch
of transition from star forming to passive, as a form of star formation
""downsizing"". This suggests that the shut off of star formation occurs before
the change in a galaxy's colour. We find that galaxy stellar mass is the
primary driving mechanisms behind the star formation history for these galaxies
and discuss several possible mechanisms for regulating this process.

two-layer configuration, similar to the one observed below an active region,
which consists of a negative layer near the solar surface and a positive one in
the layer immediately below the first one. Frequency differences between the
activity minimum and maximum of solar cycle 23, obtained applying global
helioseismology to the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO, is used to
determine the sound-speed variation from below the base of the convection zone
to a few Mm below the solar surface. We find that the sound speed at solar
maximum is smaller than at solar minimum at the limit of our determination (5.5
Mm). The min-to-max difference decreases in absolute values until ~7 Mm. At
larger depths, the sound speed at solar maximum is larger than at solar minimum
and their difference increases with depth until ~10 Mm. At this depth, the
relative difference is less than half of the value observed at the lowest depth
determination. At deeper layers, it slowly decreases with depth until there is
no difference between maximum and minimum activity.

URu$_2$Si$_2$. While confirming previous results for the HO and PM phases, our
data reveal a pronounced wavevector dependence of low-energy excitations across
the phase transition. To analyze the energy scans we employ a damped harmonic
oscillator model containing a fit parameter $1/\Gamma$ which is expected to
diverge at a second-order phase transition. Counter to expectations the
excitations at $\vec{Q}_1=(1.44,0,0)$ show an abrupt step-like suppression of
$1/\Gamma$ below $T_0$, whereas excitations at $\vec{Q}_0=(1,0,0)$, associated
with large-moment antiferromagnetism (LMAF) under pressure, show an enhancement
and a pronounced peak of $1/\Gamma$ at $T_0$. Therefore, at the critical HO
temperature $T_0$, LMAF fluctuations become nearly critical as well. This is
the behavior expected of a super-vector order parameter with nearly degenerate
components for the HO and LMAF leading to nearly isotropic fluctuations in the
combined order-parameter space.

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between the A and B-star pulsational instability
strips. With the aid of the high precision continuous measurements of the CoRoT
space satellite, low amplitudes are more easily detected, making a study of
this neglected region worthwhile. Aims. We collected a small sample of B stars
observed by CoRoT to determine the origin of the different types of variability
observed. Methods. We combine literature photometry and spectroscopy to measure
the fundamental parameters of the stars in the sample, and compare
asteroseismic modelling of the light curves with (differentially rotating)
spotted star models. Results. We found strong evidence for the existence of
spots and differential rotation in HD 174648, and formulated hypotheses for
their origin. We show that the distinction between pulsations and rotational
modulation is difficult to make solely based on the light curve, especially in
slowly rotating stars.

we present X-ray characteristics of age-related observational results, by
comparing with typical old elliptical galaxies in terms of metal abundances in
the hot interstellar matter (ISM). While the absolute element abundances may be
uncertain because of unknown systematic errors and partly because of the
smaller amount of hot gas in young ellipticals, the relative abundance ratios
(e.g., the alpha-element to Fe ratio, most importantly Si/Fe ratio) can be
relatively well constrained. We find that in two young elliptical galaxies (NGC
720 and NGC 3923) the Si to Fe abundance ratio is super-solar (at a 99%
significance level), in contrast to typical old elliptical galaxies where the
Si to Fe abundance ratio is close to solar. Also the O/Mg ratio is close to
solar in the two young elliptical galaxies, as opposed to the sub-solar O/Mg
ratio reported in old elliptical galaxies. Both features appear to be less
significant outside the effective radius (roughly 30"" for the galaxies under
study), consistent with the observations that confine to the centermost regions
the signatures of recent star formation in elliptical galaxies. Observed
differences between young and old elliptical galaxies can be explained by the
additional contribution from SNe II ejecta in the former. In young elliptical
galaxies, the later star formation associated with recent mergers would have a
dual effect, resulting both in galaxy scale winds - and therefore smaller
observed amounts of hot ISM - because of the additional SNII heating, and in
different metal abundances, because of the additional SNII yields.

oxynitride TaON is expected to combine their advantages and act as an efficient

calculations we show that TaON has different defect properties from the binary
tantalum oxide and nitride: (i) instead of O or N vacancies or Ta
interstitials, the $O_N$ antisite is the dominant defect, which determines its
intrinsic n-type conductivity and the p-type doping difficulty; (ii) the $O_N$
antisite has a shallower donor level than O or N vacancies, with a delocalized
distribution composed mainly of the Ta $5d$ orbitals, which gives rise to
better electronic conductivity in the oxynitride than in the oxide and nitride.
The phase stability analysis reveals that the easy oxidation of TaON is
inevitable under O rich conditions, and a relatively O poor condition is
required to synthesize stoichiometric TaON samples.

power-law scaling of network density and size under adequate renormalization

advance a recent discovery of a universal scaling of density among different

the comprehension of self-similar structure in large real-world networks with

interactions. Here, we use theory and simulation to show that assembly of one
such structure is not predicted by the second virial coefficient or enhanced by
the critical point. Instead, good assembly requires that the thermodynamic
driving force be on the order of the thermal energy and that interactions be
made as nonspecific as possible without promoting liquid-vapor phase
separation.

govern to a great extent the complex rheological properties of the cytoskeleton
in eukaryotic cells. In recent years, much effort has been put into capturing
the dynamics of these fluctuations by means of analytical and numerical models.
These attempts have been very successful for, but also remain limited to,
isotropic polymers. To correctly interpret experimental work on (strongly)
anisotropic semiflexible polymers, there is a need for a numerical modelling
tool that accurately captures the dynamics of polymers with anisotropic
material properties. In the current study, we present a finite element (FE)
framework for simulating the thermal dynamics of a single anisotropic
semiflexible polymer. First, we demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by
comparison of the simulated mean square displacement (MSD) of the end-to-end
distance with analytical predictions based on the worm-like chain model. Then,
we implement a transversely isotropic material model, characteristic for
biopolymers such as MTs, and study the persistence length for various ratios
between the longitudinal shear modulus and corresponding Young's modulus.
Finally, we put our findings in context by addressing a recent experimental
work on grafted transversely isotropic MTs. In that research, a simplified
static mechanical model was used to deduce a very high level of MT anisotropy
to explain the observation that the persistence length of grafted MTs increases
as contour length increases. We show, by means of our FE framework, that the
anisotropic properties cannot account for the reported length-dependent
persistence length.

cosmology is provided from a more philosophical point of view. In essence, a
digression on how could philosophy help cosmologists in what is strictly their
fundamental endeavor is presented. We start by recalling some examples of
enduring confrontations among philosophers and physicists on what could be
contributed by the formers to the day-time striving of the second ones. Then, a
short review of the standard model Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walter (FLRW)
of cosmology is given. It seems apparent that cosmology is living a golden age
with the advent of observations of high precision. Nonetheless, a critical
revisiting of the direction in which it should go on appears also needed, for
misconcepts like ""quantum backgrounds for cosmological classical settings"" and
""quantum gravity unification"" have not been properly constructed up-to-date.
Thus, knowledge-building in cosmology, more than in any other field, should
begin with visions of the reality, then taking technical form whenever concepts
and relations inbetween are translated into a mathematical structure. It is
mandatory, therefore, that the meaning of such concepts be the same for all
cosmologists, and that any relationship among all them be tested both logically
as well as mathematically. In other words, the notorius feature of
improbability of our universe, as is well-known, assures to cosmologists a
priviledged degree of freedom for formulating interpretations and theories.
However, at the same time, it demands for their formulations and conclusions to
be considered in the light of data taken from astrophysical observations.

simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET with
those using the moving-mesh code AREPO. Both codes employ identical gravity
solvers and the same sub-resolution physics but use very different methods to
track the hydrodynamic evolution of gas. This permits us to isolate the effects
of the hydro solver on the formation and evolution of galactic gas disks in
GADGET and AREPO haloes with comparable numerical resolution. In a matching
sample of GADGET and AREPO haloes we fit simulated gas disks with exponential
profiles. We find that the cold gas disks formed using the moving mesh approach
have systematically larger disk scale lengths and higher specific angular
momenta than their GADGET counterparts across a wide range in halo masses. For
low mass galaxies differences between the properties of the simulated galaxy
disks are caused by an insufficient number of resolution elements which lead to
the artificial angular momentum transfer in our SPH calculation. We however
find that galactic disks formed in massive halos, resolved with 10^6
particles/cells, are still systematically smaller in the GADGET run by a factor
of ~2. The reasons for this are: 1) The excessive heating of haloes close to
the cooling radius due to spurious dissipation of the subsonic turbulence in
GADGET; and 2) The efficient delivery of low angular momentum gaseous blobs to
the bottom of the potential well. While this large population of gaseous blobs
in GADGET originates from the filaments which are pressure confined and
fragment due to the SPH surface tension while infalling into hot halo
atmospheres, it is essentially absent in the moving mesh calculation, clearly
indicating numerical rather than physical origin of the blob material.

  The H-alpha line, used for estimating star formation rates, is commonly
measured by imaging in a narrow band and a wide band, both which include the
line. The image analysis relies on the accurate removal of the underlying
continuum. We discuss in detail the derivation of the emission line's
equivalent width and flux for extragalactic extended sources, and the required
photometric calibrations. We describe commonly used continuum-subtraction
procedures, and discuss the uncertainties that they introduce.
  Specifically, we analyse errors introduced by colour effects. We show that
the errors in the measured H-alpha equivalent width induced by colour effects
can lead to underestimates as large as 40% and overestimates as large as 10%,
depending on the underlying galaxy's stellar population and the
continuum-subtraction procedure used. We also show that these errors may lead
to biases in results of surveys, and to the underestimation of the cosmic star
formation rate at low redshifts (the low z points in the Madau plot). We
suggest a method to significantly reduce these errors using a single colour
measurement.

for their strong H-delta absorption but weak (or non-existent) [OII]3727 and
H-alpha emission. This selection suggests that a recent burst of star-formation
was triggered but subsequently abruptly ended. We probe the spatial and
spectral properties of both the young (~1Gyr) and old (few Gyr) stellar
populations. Using the H-delta equivalent widths we estimate that the burst
masses must have been at least 10% by mass (Mburst~10^10Mo), which is also
consistent with the star-formation history inferred from the broad-band SEDs.
On average the A-stars cover ~33% of the galaxy image, extending over
2-15kpc^2, indicating that the characteristic E+A signature is a property of
the galaxy as a whole and not due to a heterogeneous mixture of populations. In
approximately half of the sample, we find that the A-stars, nebular emission,
and continuum emission are not co-located, suggesting that the newest stars are
forming in a different place than those that formed ~1Gyr ago, and that recent
star-formation has occurred in regions distinct from the oldest stellar
populations. At least ten of the galaxies (91%) have dynamics that class them
as ""fast rotators"" with magnitudes and dynamics comparable to local ellipticals
and S0's. We also find a correlation between the spatial extent of the A-stars
and dynamics such that the fastest rotators tend to have the most compact
A-star populations, providing new constraints on models that aim to explain the
transformation of later type galaxies into early types. Finally, we show that
there are no obvious differences between the line extents and kinematics of E+A

that AGN feedback does not play a dramatic role in defining their properties,

outflows. However, the interaction between the outflowing gas and the turbulent
core envelope produces significant asymmetry between the red and blue shifted
outflow lobes. We find that applying a velocity cutoff may result in outflow
masses that are underestimated by a factor 5 or more, and masses derived from
optically thick CO emission further underpredict the mass of the high-velocity

off impurities. The magnitude of the effective disorder scattering rate is
important for understanding the stability of the topological (chiral p-wave)
superconducting state that emerges in the semiconductor, since disorder
scattering has a detrimental effect and can drive the system into a

We show that, despite the fact that both the proximity-induced gap and the

responsible for early universe inflation. To examine this, here we present a
simple version of Higgs-inflation with minimal coupling to gravity and a
quadratic inflationary potential. This quantitatively differs from the popular
non-minimally coupled models, although it is qualitatively similar. In all such
models, new heavy fields must enter in order for the theory to be well behaved
in the UV. We show that in all cases the Higgs self coupling lambda must be
quite small in order to integrate out the heavy fields and use the resulting
low energy effective field theory of the Higgs to describe inflation. For
moderately sized lambda, the UV completion is required and will, in general,
determine the inflationary regime. We discuss the important issue of the
arbitrariness of the Lagrangians used in all these setups by presenting a new
class of such models, including a supergravity version. This suggests that the
inflationary potential is disconnected from low energy physics.

membrane. Although much work has focused on the mechanisms behind such cluster
formation, the implications for downstream signaling remain poorly understood.
Here, motivated by recent experiments, we study via particle-based simulation a
covalent modification network in which the activating component is either
clustered or randomly distributed on the membrane. We find that while
clustering reduces the response of a single-modification network, clustering
can enhance the response of a double-modification network. The reduction is a
bulk effect: a cluster presents a smaller effective target to a substrate
molecule in the bulk. The enhancement, on the other hand, is a local effect: a
cluster promotes the rapid rebinding and second activation of singly active
substrate molecules. As such, the enhancement relies upon frequent collisions
on a short timescale, which leads to a diffusion coefficient at which the
enhancement is optimal. We complement simulation with analytic results at both
the mean-field and first-passage distribution levels. Our results emphasize the
importance of spatially resolved models, showing that significant effects of
spatial correlations persist even in spatially averaged quantities such as
response curves.

common white dwarfs have carbon-oxygen dense cores. Consequently, the cooling
ages of very cool white dwarfs sensitively depend on the adopted phase diagram
of the carbon-oxygen binary mixture. A new phase diagram of dense carbon-oxygen
mixtures appropriate for white dwarf interiors has been recently obtained using
direct molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we explore the
consequences of this phase diagram in the evolution of cool white dwarfs. To do
this we employ a detailed stellar evolutionary code and accurate initial white
dwarf configurations, derived from the full evolution of progenitor stars. We
use two different phase diagrams, that of Horowitz et al. (2010), which
presents an azeotrope, and the phase diagram of Segretain & Chabrier (1993),
which is of the spindle form. We computed the evolution of 0.593 and 0.878M_sun
white dwarf models during the crystallization phase, and we found that the
energy released by carbon-oxygen phase separation is smaller when the new phase
diagram of Horowitz et al. (2010) is used. This translates into time delays
that are on average a factor about 2 smaller than those obtained when the phase
diagram of Segretain & Chabrier (1993) is employed. Our results have important
implications for white dwarf cosmochronology, because the cooling ages of very
old white dwarfs are different for the two phase diagrams. This may have a
noticeable impact on the age determinations of very old globular clusters, for
which the white dwarf color-magnitude diagram provides an independent way of
estimating their age.

such explanatory abstractions using program transformations. We consider two
types of transformation: Abstraction merges common subexpressions within a

galaxies of collisionless, scale-free, rigidly rotating, self-gravitating discs
with spiral symmetry. Such discs must be truncated at a finite radius, and they
must be stabilized and rendered self-similar by a suitable halo. The halo and
the rotating disc share the self-similar class and must form together to arrive
at the suggested state. We make comparisons with the well-known rigidly
rotating, Kalnajs discs; one of which is axi-symmetric and finite while the
other is infinite and decomposed into spiral modes. We find the
self-consistent, self-similar, distribution functions in one and two dimensions
in a rigidly rotating, collisionless system. In the case of two dimensions we
deduce the self-consistency condition for discrete spiral arms.
  We give an estimate of the disturbance created in the halo by the presence of
the disc, and argue that the halo itself should be close to self-similarity. A
very weak cusp in the halo may be necessary. The necessary spatial coincidence
of the halo results in a kind of disc-halo `conspiracy'. Finally the disc
equations are formulated in `spiral' coordinates, and the passage to an
approximately discrete `line spiral' is given as an example. Although in two
dimensions the collisionless particles enter and leave the arms in non-linear
epicycles, they move approximately parallel to the arms in the line spiral
limit. The spiral pattern is however in rigid rotation. Aperiodic spiral arms
are suggested wherein discontinuities may be coarse-grained to appear as
collisionless shocks.

to a lack of empirical evidence on how it is distributed. We characterize the
intrinsic heterogeneity of groups in an online community and then show that
together with a simple linear growth and an inhomogeneous birth rate it
explains the broad distribution of group members.

conditions at each end, and an internal damper at an arbitrary point along the
bar's length. The system is described by four independent parameters and
exhibits a variety of behaviors including rigid motion, super
stability/instability and zero damping. The solution is obtained by applying
the Laplace transform to the equation of motion and computing the Green's
function of the transformed problem. This leads to an unconventional
eigenvalue-like problem with the spectral variable in the boundary conditions.
The eigenmodes of the problem are necessarily complex-valued and are not
orthogonal in the usual inner product. Nonetheless, in generic cases we obtain
an explicit eigenmode expansion for the response of the bar to initial
conditions and external force. For some special values of parameters the system
of eigenmodes may become incomplete, or no non-trivial eigenmodes may exist at
all. We thoroughly analyze physical and mathematical reasons for this behavior
and explicitly identify the corresponding parameter values. In particular, when
no eigenmodes exist, we obtain closed form solutions. Theoretical analysis is
complemented by numerical simulations, and analytic solutions are compared to
computations using finite elements.

required level of sophistication to the analysis. Thus, an approach which

desirable, it is vital. The expertise required spans not just astronomy, but
also computer science, statistics, and informatics. As a computer scientist and
expert in machine learning, Alex's contribution of expertise and a large number
of fast algorithms designed to scale to large datasets, is extremely welcome.
We focus in this discussion on the questions raised by the practical
application of these algorithms to real astronomical datasets. That is, what is
needed to maximally leverage their potential to improve the science return?
This is not a trivial task. While computing and statistical expertise are
required, so is astronomical expertise. Precedent has shown that, to-date, the
collaborations most productive in producing astronomical science results (e.g,
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey), have either involved astronomers expert in
computer science and/or statistics, or astronomers involved in close, long-term
collaborations with experts in those fields. This does not mean that the
astronomers are giving the most important input, but simply that their input is
crucial in guiding the effort in the most fruitful directions, and coping with
the issues raised by real data. Thus, the tools must be useable and
understandable by those whose primary expertise is not computing or statistics,

are predicted using two outflow geometries: a Shell of neutral gas and a Wind
ejecting material, both expanding at constant velocity. We characterise the
differences in the Ly-alpha line profiles predicted by the two outflow
geometries in terms of their width, asymmetry and shift from the line centre
for a set of outflows with different hydrogen column densities, expansion
velocities and metallicities. In general, the Ly-alpha line profile of the
Shell geometry is broader and more asymmetric, and the Ly-alpha escape fraction
is lower than with the Wind geometry for the same set of parameters. In order
to implement the outflow geometries in the semi-analytical model GALFORM, a
number of free parameters in the outflow model are set by matching the
luminosity function of Ly-alpha emitters over the whole observed redshift
range. The models are consistent with the observationally inferred Ly-alpha
escape fractions, equivalent width distributions and with the shape of the
Ly-alpha line from composite spectra. Interestingly, our predicted UV
luminosity function of Ly-alpha emitters and the fraction of Ly-alpha emitters
in Lyman-break galaxy samples at high redshift are in partial agreement with
observations. Attenuation of the Ly-alpha line by the presence of a neutral
intergalactic medium at high redshift could be responsible for this
disagreement. We predict that Ly-alpha emitters constitute a subset of the
galaxy population with lower metallicities, lower instantaneous star formation
rates and larger sizes than the overall population at the same UV luminosity.

two main challenges: opening up a bandgap and finding a suitable substrate
material. In principle, graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate
provides potential system to overcome these challenges. Recent theoretical and
experimental studies have provided conflicting results: while theoretical
studies suggested a possibility of a finite bandgap of graphene on hBN, recent
experimental studies find no bandgap. Using the first-principles density
functional method and the many-body perturbation theory, we have studied
graphene on hBN substrate. A Bernal stacked graphene on hBN has a bandgap on
the order of 0.1 eV, which disappears when graphene is misaligned with respect
to hBN. The latter is the likely scenario in realistic devices. In contrast, if
graphene supported on hBN is hydrogenated, the resulting system (graphone)
exhibits bandgaps larger than 2.5 eV. While the bandgap opening in graphene/hBN
is due to symmetry breaking and is vulnerable to slight perturbation such as
misalignment, the graphone bandgap is due to chemical functionalization and is
robust in the presence of misalignment. The bandgap of graphone reduces by
about 1 eV when it is supported on hBN due to the polarization effects at the
graphone/hBN interface. The band offsets at graphone/hBN interface indicate
that hBN can be used not only as a substrate but also as a dielectric in the
field effect devices employing graphone as a channel material. Our study could
open up new way of bandgap engineering in graphene based nanostructures.

SOC. Y.-J. Lin {\it et al.} recently demonstrated a special form of the SOC
$k_x\sigma_y$: which they interpret as an equal superposition of Rashba and
Dresselhaus couplings, in bose condensed atoms [Nature (London) \textbf{471},

of SOC by switching between two pairs of Raman laser pulses like that used by
Lin {\it et al.}. While one pair affects $k_x\sigma_y$ for some time, a second
pair creates $k_y\sigma_y$ over other times with Raman pulses from different
directions and a subsequent spin rotation into $\pm k_y\sigma_x$. With
sufficient many pulses, the effective actions from different durations are
small and accumulate in the same exponent despite that $k_x\sigma_y$ and $\pm
k_y\sigma_x$ do not commute. Our scheme involves no added complication, and can
be demonstrated within current experiments. It applies equally to bosonic or

$(1-\epsilon)\frac{d}{2}\log n$ for any $\epsilon>0$. Our results also confirm
that for large enough $n$ and $d$, the average minimax redundancy provides a
good estimate for the redundancy of most sources. Our result may be used to
evaluate the performance of universal source coding schemes on finite-length
sequences. Additionally, we precisely characterize the minimax redundancy for
two--stage codes. We demonstrate that the two--stage assumption incurs a

reaction data below the Coulomb barrier for the $^{141}$Pr-$\alpha$ system.
Reasons for the partial failure of the global potentials are explained by
intrinsic properties of the scattering matrix and their variation with energy.

the edge uniaxial anisotropy, and impurities on the allowed spin waves of

VLBI-core and optical polarizations, although some of the AGNs also showed no
obvious relationship between VLBI-core and optical polarization angles. This
may indicate that some AGNs have co-spatial regions of optical and radio
emission, while others do not. Another possibility is that some of the VLBI
cores had Faraday rotations of several tens of thousand of rad/m^2, which were
not properly fit using the three-frequency data due to n\pi ambiguities in the
observed polarization angles, leading to incorrect subtraction of the effects
of the core Faraday rotation, and so incorrect intrinsic radio polarization
angles \chi_0. We obtained additional 12+15+22+24+43GHz plus optical
observations for 8 of 40 AGNs previously considered. Our results indicate that,
although some VLBI radio cores have comparatively high rotation measures, this
alone cannot explain the misalignments found between the radio core and optical
VLBI polarization angles, \Delta\chi = |\chi_opt - \chi_0|. Comparison between
\Delta\chi and (i) the orientation of \chi_0 relative to the jet direction,
(ii) the degree of polarization of the core, (iii) a depolarization factor,
(iv) the core rotation measures and (v) the core magnetic fields 1pc from the
jet base do not yield evidence for any correlations between these properties.
There is some evidence that the maximum observed \Delta\chi tends to decrease
as the core-region magnetic field increases, suggesting that misalignments in
\Delta\chi could be associated in part with relatively low core magnetic
fields. Thus, although the overall distribution of \Delta\chi for all 40
sources in our sample does show a significant peak at \Delta\chi\sim0, it
remains unclear what distinguishes these AGN cores from those showing
appreciable misalignment between optical and VLBI-core polarization position

plateau characteristic of the domain wall compression at the hard/soft
interface ending at the depinning of the wall inside the hard phase. This
compression / depinning behavior is clearly evidenced through one dimensional
description of the interface, which is rigorously possible only in stratified
media. Starting from a local description of the hard/soft interface in a model
for nanocomposite system we show that one can extend this kind of behavior for
system of hard crystallites embedded in a soft matrix.

non-radial random motions, and most importantly, an advanced treatment of both
dynamical relaxation effects that takes place in the infalling matter:
phase-mixing associated to shell crossing, and collective collisions related to
physical clumpiness. We find self-similar solutions for the
spherically-averaged profiles of mass density rho(r), pseudo phase-space
density Q(r) and anisotropy parameter beta(r). These profiles agree with the
outcomes of state-of-the-art N-body simulations in the radial range currently
probed by the latter; at smaller radii, we provide specific predictions. In the
perspective provided by our self-similar solutions we link the halo structure
to its two-stage growth history, and propose the following picture. During the
early fast collapse of the inner region dominated by a few merging clumps,
efficient dynamical relaxation plays a key role in producing a closely
universal mass density and pseudo phase-space density profiles; in particular,
these are found to depend only weakly on the detailed shape of the initial
perturbation and the related collapse times. The subsequent inside-out growth
of the outer regions feeds on the slow accretion of many small clumps and
diffuse matter; thus the outskirts are only mildly affected by dynamical
relaxation but are more sensitive to asymmetries and cosmological variance.

spectrum includes both photospheric absorption lines and emission features (H

well as an infrared excess indicating the presence of a (flaring) circumstellar
disk. The strongest emission lines are double-peaked with a peak separation
ranging between 70 and 105 km s^-1 and provide information on the physical
structure of the disk. The underlying photospheric spectrum is classified as
B6-B7, significantly cooler than a previous estimate based on modeling of the
spectral energy distribution. This discrepancy is solved by allowing for a
larger stellar radius (i.e. a bloated star), and thus positioning the star
above the main sequence. This constitutes the first firm spectral

Although the position is consistent with PMS tracks of heavily accreting

Usually, one considers propagation of these vortex beams in a medium or

consider instead a beam-beam collision. We show that elastic scattering of a
Bessel vortex beam with a counterpropagating plane wave naturally leads to two
vortex-entangled outgoing beams. The vortex entanglement implies that the two
final particles are entangled not only in their orbital helicities but also in
opening angles of their momentum cones. Our results are driven by kinematics of
vortex-beam scattering and apply to particle pairs of any nature: e-gamma,
e^+e^-, ep, etc. This collisional vortex entanglement can be used to create
pairs of OAM-entangled particles of different nature, and to transfer a phase
vortex, for example, from low-energy electrons to high-energy protons.

dynamics of a polymer chain through a nanopore. Our consideration is based on
the tensile (Pincus) blob picture of a pulled chain and the notion of
propagating front of tensile force along the chain backbone, suggested recently
by T. Sakaue. The driving force is associated with a chemical potential
gradient that acts on each chain segment inside the pore. Depending on its
strength, different regimes of polymer motion (named after the typical chain
conformation, ""trumpet"", ""stem-trumpet"", etc.) occur. Assuming that the local
driving and drag forces are equal (i.e., in a quasi-static approximation), we
derive an equation of motion for the tensile front position $X(t)$. We show
that the scaling law for the average translocation time $<\tau>$ changes from
$<\tau> \sim N^{2\nu}/f^{1/\nu}$ to $<\tau> \sim N^{1+\nu}/f$ (for the
free-draining case) as the dimensionless force ${\widetilde f}_{R} = a N^{\nu}f
/T$ (where $a$, $N$, $\nu$, $f$, $T$ are the Kuhn segment length, the chain
length, the Flory exponent, the driving force, and the temperature,
respectively) increases. These and other predictions are tested by Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulation. Data from our computer experiment indicates indeed
that the translocation scaling exponent $\alpha$ grows with the pulling force
${\widetilde f}_{R}$) albeit the observed exponent $\alpha$ stays
systematically smaller than the theoretically predicted value. This might be
associated with fluctuations which are neglected in the quasi-static
approximation.

high-performance linear algebra libraries used in many
computationally-demanding digital signal processing (DSP) systems. We propose
an acceleration technique for GEMM based on dynamically adjusting the
imprecision (distortion) of computation. Our technique employs adaptive scalar
companding and rounding to input matrix blocks followed by two forms of packing
in floating-point that allow for concurrent calculation of multiple results.
Since the adaptive companding process controls the increase of concurrency (via
packing), the increase in processing throughput (and the corresponding increase
in distortion) depends on the input data statistics. To demonstrate this, we
derive the optimal throughput-distortion control framework for GEMM for the
broad class of zero-mean, independent identically distributed, input sources.
Our approach converts matrix multiplication in programmable processors into a
computation channel: when increasing the processing throughput, the output
noise (error) increases due to (i) coarser quantization and (ii) computational
errors caused by exceeding the machine-precision limitations. We show that,
under certain distortion in the GEMM computation, the proposed framework can
significantly surpass 100% of the peak performance of a given processor. The
practical benefits of our proposal are shown in a face recognition system and a
multi-layer perceptron system trained for metadata learning from a large music
feature database.

identify three regions. In the first one (non-summable correlations) the phase
transition disappears. In the second one (correlations decaying fast enough)
the system behaves essentially like in the i.i.d. setting and the

group of a leaf of a foliation. For dimension one, there is a well-established

algebraic properties (finiteness, commutativity, solvability, ...). Such system
of equivalences also characterizes the existence of suitable {\it integrating

In this paper we search the basic lines of such dictionary for the case of
several complex variables groups. For abelian, metabelian, solvable or
nilpotent groups we investigate the existence of suitable formal vector fields
and closed differential forms which exhibit an invariance property under the

  with heavy-tailed stochastic volatility",,,,,"q-fin.ST stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an empirical test of financial contagion in European
equity markets during the tumultuous period of 2008-2011. Our analysis shows
that traditional GARCH and Gaussian stochastic-volatility models are unable to
explain two key stylized features of global markets during presumptive
contagion periods: shocks to aggregate market volatility can be sudden and
explosive, and they are associated with specific directional biases in the
cross-section of country-level returns. Our model repairs this deficit by
assuming that the random shocks to volatility are heavy-tailed and correlated
cross-sectionally, both with each other and with returns. The fundamental
conclusion of our analysis is that great care is needed in modeling volatility
if one wishes to characterize the relationship between volatility and contagion
that is predicted by economic theory.
  In analyzing daily data, we find evidence for significant contagion effects
during the major EU crisis periods of May 2010 and August 2011, where contagion
is defined as excess correlation in the residuals from a factor model
incorporating global and regional market risk factors. Some of this excess
correlation can be explained by quantifying the impact of shocks to aggregate
volatility in the cross-section of expected returns - but only, it turns out,
if one is extremely careful in accounting for the explosive nature of these
shocks. We show that global markets have time-varying cross-sectional
sensitivities to these shocks, and that high sensitivities strongly predict
periods of financial crisis. Moreover, the pattern of temporal changes in
correlation structure between volatility and returns is readily interpretable
in terms of the major events of the periods in question.

in quantum theory. Time observables are interesting quantities in quantum
theory because they often cannot be associated with self-adjoint operators.
Their definition therefore touches on foundational issues in quantum theory.
  Various operational approaches to defining time observables have been
proposed in the past. Two of the most common are those based on pulsed
measurements in the form of strings of projection operators and continuous
measurements in the form of complex potentials. One of the major achievements
of this thesis is to prove that these two operational approaches are
equivalent.
  However operational approaches are somewhat unsatisfying by themselves. To
provide a definition of time observables which is not linked to a particular
measurement scheme we employ the decoherent, or consistent, histories approach
to quantum theory. We focus on the arrival time, one particular example of a
time observable, and we use the relationship between pulsed and continuous
measurements to relate the decoherent histories approach to one based on
complex potentials. This lets us compute the arrival time probability
distribution in decoherent histories and we show that it agrees with
semiclassical expectations in the right limit. We do this both for a free
particle and for a particle coupled to an environment.
  Finally, we consider how the results discussed in this thesis relate to those
derived by coupling a particle to a model clock. We show that for a general
class of clock models the probabilities thus measured can be simply related to
the ideal ones computed via decoherent histories.

STor, a novel social network based Tor. We have implemented STor by modifying
the Tor's source code and conducted experiments on PlanetLab to evaluate the
effectiveness of STor. Both simulation and PlanetLab experiment results have
demonstrated that STor can achieve secure anonymity by establishing trust-based

symmetrically delocalized over N modes, namely a W state, effectively allows
for all-versus-nothing proofs of nonlocality in the limit of large N. Ideally,
this finding opens up the possibility of using the robustness of the W states
while realizing the nonlocal behavior previously thought to be exclusive to the
more complex class of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. We show that in

higher N. The non-statistical demonstration of nonlocality is thus proved to be
impossible in any realistic experiment.

relational data bases and knowledge systems. It can also be presented in the
terms of finite lattices, and the tools of economic description of a finite
lattice have long existed in lattice theory. We present this approach by
describing the so-called D-basis and introducing the concept of ordered direct
basis of an implicational system. A direct basis of a closure operator, or an
implicational system, is a set of implications that allows one to compute the
closure of an arbitrary set by a single iteration. This property is preserved
by the D-basis at the cost of following a prescribed order in which
implications will be attended. In particular, using an ordered direct basis
allows to optimize the forward chaining procedure in logic programming that
uses the Horn fragment of propositional logic. One can extract the D-basis from
any direct unit basis S in time polynomial in the size of S, and it takes only
linear time of the cardinality of the D-basis to put it into a proper order. We
produce examples of closure systems on a 6-element set, for which the canonical
basis of Duquenne and Guigues is not ordered direct.

provides unique spectral time series down to 2000 Angstrom. Significant
diversity is seen in the near maximum-light spectra (~ 2000--3500 Angstrom) for
this small sample. The corresponding photometric data, together with archival
data from Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope observations, provide further
evidence of increased dispersion in the UV emission with respect to the
optical. The peak luminosities measured in uvw1/F250W are found to correlate
with the B-band light-curve shape parameter dm15(B), but with much larger
scatter relative to the correlation in the broad-band B band (e.g., ~0.4 mag
versus ~0.2 mag for those with 0.8 < dm15 < 1.7 mag). SN 2004dt is found as an
outlier of this correlation (at > 3 sigma), being brighter than normal SNe Ia
such as SN 2005cf by ~0.9 mag and ~2.0 mag in the uvw1/F250W and uvm2/F220W
filters, respectively. We show that different progenitor metallicity or
line-expansion velocities alone cannot explain such a large discrepancy.
Viewing-angle effects, such as due to an asymmetric explosion, may have a
significant influence on the flux emitted in the UV region. Detailed modeling
is needed to disentangle and quantify the above effects.

is closely related to the second law and the positivity of the entropy
production. Here we study the applicability of the Le Chatelier principle to
evolutionary game theory, i.e., to perturbations of a Nash equilibrium within
the replicator dynamics. We show that the principle can be reformulated as a
majorization relation. This defines a stability notion that generalizes the
concept of evolutionary stability. We determine criteria for a Nash equilibrium
to satisfy the Le Chatelier principle and relate them to mutualistic
interactions (game-theoretical anticoordination) showing in which sense
mutualistic replicators can be more stable than (say) competing ones. There are
globally stable Nash equilibria, where the Le Chatelier principle is violated
even locally: in contrast to the thermodynamic equilibrium a Nash equilibrium
can amplify small perturbations, though both this type of equilibria satisfy

geometry and convection in geophysical flows. It is shown in particular that
the system always undergoes a continuous (Type-I) transition to a
$2l_c$-dimensional sphere $S^{2lc}$, where lc is the critical wave length
corresponding to the critical Rayleigh number. Furthermore, it has shown in
[12] that it is critical to add nonisotropic turbulent friction terms in the
momentum equation to capture the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic
circulation patterns. We show in particular that the system with turbulent
friction terms added undergoes the same type of dynamic transition, and obtain
an explicit formula linking the critical wave number (pattern selection), the
aspect ratio, and the ratio between the horizontal and vertical turbulent
friction coefficients.

  Scheme","12 pages, 4 figures",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we are able to justify the existence or no of photons emitted
during $\alpha$ decay, based on the average half life times using the BCS
superconductivity and superfluidity theories. The proposed model suggests two
possible channels. A first channel where the protons and neutrons interact
separately through a spin coupling, giving rise to diprotons and dineutrons
which in turn interact through an isospin coupling to form an $\alpha$
particle, and a second channel where the protons and neutrons are treated as
nucleons that interact through an isospin coupling, giving rise to deuterons,
which in turn interact through a spin coupling to form an $\alpha$ particle.
Due to the nature of the involved particles, the systems considered are
homogeneous. For the second channel, the photon play a very important role for
the possible escape of the $\alpha$ particle. Within these premises the half
life times of a considerable number of heavy nuclei with spherical symmetry can
be estimated with good experimental agreement.

order parameter in a nonlocal way. Therefore, the resulting system consists of
the energy balance equation coupled with a nonlinear and nonlocal ODE for the
order parameter. Such system has been analyzed by several authors, in
particular when the configuration potential is a smooth double-well function.
More recently, in the case of a potential defined on (-1,1) and singular at the
endpoints, the existence of a finite-dimensional global attractor has been
proven. Here we examine both the case of smooth potentials as well as the case
of physically realistic (e.g., logarithmic) singular potentials. We prove
well-posedness results and the eventual global boundedness of solutions
uniformly with respect to the initial data. In addition, we show that the
separation property holds in the case of singular potentials. Thanks to these
results, we are able to demonstrate the existence of a finite-dimensional
attractors in the present cases as well.

Einstein's theory of general relativity, using instead a scalar-tensor theory
of gravitation. This theory of gravity crucially incorporates the concept of
quantum symmetry breaking. The role of the cosmological constant $\lambda$ as a
graviton mass in the weak-field limit is necessarily utilized. Because
$\lambda$ takes on two values as a broken symmetry, so does the graviton mass
-- one of which cannot be zero. Gravity now exhibits both long- and short-range
forces, by introducing hadron bags into strong interaction physics using a
nonlinear, self-interacting scalar $\sigma$-field coupled to the gravitational
Lagrangian.

statement it is argued here that when the source of the electromagnetic
potential is treated in the framework of quantum theory, the Aharonov-Bohm
effect can be explained without the notion of potentials. It is explained by
local action of the field of the electron on the source of the potential. The
core of the Aharonov-Bohm effect is the same as the core of quantum
entanglement: the quantum wave function describes all systems together.
