scanning tunneling microscope above a spin-1/2 magnetic adatom (such as Ti)
adsorbed on a decoupling layer on metal surface can be accurately fitted using
the universal spectral function of the Kondo impurity model both at zero field
and at finite external magnetic field. Excellent agreement is found both for
the asymptotic low-energy part and for the high-energy logarithmic tails of the
Kondo resonance. For finite magnetic field, the nonlinear fitting procedure
consists in repeatedly solving the impurity model for different Zeeman energies
in order to obtain accurate spectral functions which are compared with the
experimental dI/dV curves. The experimental results at zero field are
sufficiently restraining to enable an unprecedented reliability in the
determination of the Kondo temperature, while at finite fields the results are
more ambiguous and two different interpretations are proposed.

of newly formed close binaries can interact, dissipate energy, and produce
synchrotron radiation. The V773 Tau A binary system, a pair of T Tauri stars
with a 51 day orbit, displays such a signature, with peak emission taking place
near periastron. This paper proposes that the observed emission arises from the
change in energy stored in the composite magnetic field of the system. We model
the fields using the leading order (dipole) components and show that this
picture is consistent with current observations. In this model, the observed
radiation accounts for a fraction of the available energy of interaction
between the magnetic fields from the two stars. Assuming antisymmetry, we
compute the interaction energy $E_{\rm int}$ as a function of the stellar
radii, the stellar magnetic field strengths, the binary semi-major axis, and
orbital eccentricity, all of which can be measured independently of the
synchrotron radiation. The variability in time and energetics of the
synchrotron radiation depend on the details of the annihilation of magnetic
fields through reconnection events, which generate electric fields that
accelerate charged particles, and how those charged particles, especially fast
electrons, are removed from the interaction region. However, the major
qualitative features are well described by the background changes in the global
magnetic configuration driven by the orbital motion. The theory can be tested
by observing a collection of pre-main-sequence binary systems.

from each other. Results of the first-principles calculations were used to
compare and discuss, in the context of the cation properties, specific changes
in local charge structures and in chemical bonding caused by the presence of
the impurity. Certain trends in substituent effects were found. It was
determined how the substitutional ion modifies the initial charge distribution

used to enrich a jet sample in heavy flavor content. The efficiency measurement
relies on the transverse momentum of the muon relative to the jet axis or on

Another approach uses the number of b-tagged jets in top pair events to
estimate the efficiency. The results obtained in 2010 data and the

combinatorial constructions and weak invariance principles, we obtain the
limiting shape of the associated RSK Young diagrams as a multidimensional
Brownian functional. Since the length of the top row of the Young diagrams is
also the length of the longest weakly increasing subsequences of $(X_k)_{1\le k

conjecture of Kuperberg by providing, under a cyclic condition, a spectral
characterization of the Markov transition matrix precisely characterizing when
the limiting shape is the spectrum of the $m \times m$ traceless GUE. For each
$m \ge 4$, this characterization identifies a proper, non-trivial class of
cyclic transition matrices producing such a limiting shape. However, for $m=3$,
all cyclic Markov chains have such a limiting shape, a fact previously only
known for $m=2$. For $m$ arbitrary, we also study reversible Markov chains and
obtain a characterization of symmetric Markov chains for which the limiting
shape is the spectrum of the traceless GUE. To finish, we explore, in this
general setting, connections between various limiting laws and spectra of
Gaussian random matrices, focusing in particular on the relationship between
the terminal points of the Brownian motions, the diagonal terms of the random
matrix, and the scaling of its off-diagonal terms, a scaling we conjecture to
be a function of the spectrum of the covariance matrix governing the Brownian
motion.

Matches version accepted in JHEP",,"10.1007/JHEP04(2012)089",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Up to now, future neutrino beam experiments have been designed and optimized
in order to look for CP violation, \theta_{13} and the mass hierarchy under the
conservative assumption that \theta_{13} is very small. However, the recent
results from T2K and MINOS favor a \theta_{13} which could be as large as
8^{\circ}. In this work, we propose a re-optimization for neutrino beam
experiments in case this hint is confirmed. By switching from the first to the
second oscillation peak, we find that the CP discovery potential of future
oscillation experiments would not only be enhanced, but it would also be less
affected by systematic uncertainties. In order to illustrate the effect, we
present our results for a Super-Beam experiment, comparing the results obtained
at the first and the second oscillation peaks for several values of the
systematic errors. We also study its combination with a \beta-beam facility and
show that the synergy between both experiments would also be enhanced due to
the larger L/E. Moreover, the increased matter effects at the larger L/E also
significantly improves the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy.

associated to the opening of the recombination/coalescence channel for hadron
production in the plasma, it is not necessary to invoke such strong energy
loss. This shift is expressed in terms of an increase of the heavy baryon to
meson ratio in nuclear with respect to proton collisions. When this mechanism

clusters that lie within the radius of influence of a massive black hole in
galactic nuclei. Our approach to these nearly Keplerian systems follows that of
Sridhar and Touma (1999): Delaunay canonical variables are used to describe
stellar orbits and we average over the fast Keplerian orbital phases. The
stellar distribution function (DF) evolves on the longer time scale of
precessional motions, whose dynamics is governed by a Hamiltonian, given by the
orbit-averaged self-gravitational potential of the cluster. We specialize to
razor-thin, planar discs and consider two counter-rotating (""$\pm$"")
populations of stars. To describe discs of small eccentricities, we expand the
$\pm$ Hamiltonian to fourth order in the eccentricities, with coefficients that
depend self-consistently on the $\pm$ DFs. We construct approximate $\pm$
dynamical invariants and use Jeans' theorem to construct time-dependent $\pm$
DFs, which are completely described by their centroid coordinates and shape
matrices. When the centroid eccentricities are larger than the dispersion in
eccentricities, the $\pm$ centroids obey a set of 4 autonomous ordinary
differential equations. We show that these can be cast as a two-degree of
freedom Hamiltonian system which is nonlinear, yet integrable. We study the
linear instability of initially circular discs and derive a criterion for the
counter-rotating instability. We then explore the rich nonlinear dynamics of
counter-rotating discs, with focus on the variety of steadily precessing
eccentric configurations that are allowed. The stability and properties of
these configurations are studied as functions of parameters such as the disc
mass ratios and angular momentum.

stabilization of folded protein states, we systematically investigated the
action of TMAO on several model dipeptides (Leucine, L2, Serine, S2, Glutamine,
Q2, Lysine, K2, and Glycine, G2) in order to elucidate the effect of
residue-specific TMAO interactions on small fragments of solvent-exposed
conformations of the denatured states of proteins. We find that TMAO
preferentially hydrogen bonds with the exposed dipeptide backbone, but
generally not with nonpolar or polar side chains. However, interactions with
the positively charged Lys are substantially greater than with the backbone.
The dipeptide G2, is a useful model of pure amide backbone, interacts with TMAO
by forming a hydrogen bond between the amide nitrogen and the oxygen in TMAO.
In contrast, TMAO is depleted from the protein backbone in the hexapeptide G6,
which shows that the length of the polypeptide chain is relevant in aqueous
TMAO solutions. These simulations lead to the hypothesis that TMAO-induced
stabilization of proteins and peptides is a consequence of depletion of the
solute from the protein surface provided intramolecular interactions are more
favorable than those between TMAO and the backbone. To test our hypothesis we
performed additional simulations of the action of TMAO on an intrinsically
disordered A{\beta}16-22 (KLVFFAE) monomer. In the absence of TMAO
A{\beta}16-22 is a disordered random coil. However, in aqueous TMAO solution
A{\beta}16-22 monomer samples compact conformations. A transition from random
coil to {\alpha}-helical secondary structure is observed at high TMAO
concentrations. Our work highlights the potential similarities between the
action of TMAO on long polypeptide chains and entropic stabilization of
proteins in a crowded environment due to excluded volume interactions. In this
sense TMAO is a nano-crowding particle.

surfaces of gapless excitations in momentum space [O. I. Motrunich and M. P. A.
Fisher, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 75}, 235116 (2007)]. In particular, motivated by a
strong-coupling analysis of the gauge theory for the DBL, we study a model of
hard-core bosons moving on the $N$-leg square ladder with frustrating four-site
ring exchange. Here, we focus on four- and three-leg systems where we have
identified two novel phases: a compressible gapless Bose metal on the four-leg
ladder and an incompressible gapless Mott insulator on the three-leg ladder.
The former is conducting along the ladder and has five gapless modes, one more
than the number of legs. This represents a significant step forward in
establishing the potential stability of the DBL in two dimensions. The latter,
on the other hand, is a fundamentally quasi-one-dimensional phase that is
insulating along the ladder but has two gapless modes and incommensurate power
law transverse density-density correlations. In both cases, we can understand
the nature of the phase using slave-particle-inspired variational wave
functions consisting of a product of two distinct Slater determinants, the
properties of which compare impressively well to a density matrix
renormalization group solution of the model Hamiltonian. Stability arguments
are made in favor of both quantum phases by accessing the universal low-energy
physics with a bosonization analysis of the appropriate quasi-1D gauge theory.
We will briefly discuss the potential relevance of these findings to
high-temperature superconductors, cold atomic gases, and frustrated quantum

ACTpol, SPTpol and other high resolution follow-ons fundamentally rely on the
accuracy of the assumed recombination model, or one with well prescribed
uncertainties. Deviations from the standard recombination history might suggest
new particle physics or modified atomic physics. Here we treat possible
perturbative fluctuations in the free electron fraction, $\Xe(z)$, by a
semi-blind expansion in densely-packed modes in redshift. From these we
construct parameter eigenmodes, which we rank order so that the lowest modes
provide the most power to probe the $\Xe(z)$ with CMB measurements. Since the
eigenmodes are effectively weighed by the fiducial $\Xe$ history, they are
localized around the differential visibility peak, allowing for an excellent
probe of hydrogen recombination, but a weaker probe of the higher redshift
helium recombination and the lower redshift highly neutral freeze-out tail. We
use an information-based criterion to truncate the mode hierarchy, and show
that with even a few modes the method goes a long way towards morphing a
fiducial older {\sc Recfast} $X_{\rm e,i} (z)$ into the new and improved {\sc
CosmoRec} and {\sc HyRec} $X_{\rm e,f} (z)$ in the hydrogen recombination
regime, though not well in the helium regime. Without such a correction, the
derived cosmic parameters are biased. We discuss an iterative approach for
updating the eigenmodes to further hone in on $X_{\rm e,f} (z)$ if large
deviations are indeed found. We also introduce control parameters that
downweight the attention on the visibility peak structure, e.g., focusing the
eigenmode probes more strongly on the $\Xe (z)$ freeze-out tail, as would be
appropriate when looking for the $\Xe$ signature of annihilating or decaying
elementary particles.

involves two auxiliary random variables: U, for rate splitting and V, for
channel prefixing. Evaluation of regions involving auxiliary random variables
is generally difficult. In this paper, we explore specific classes of wiretap
channels for which the expression and evaluation of the rate-equivocation
region are simpler. In particular, we show that when the main channel is more
capable than the eavesdropping channel, V=X is optimal and the boundary of the
rate-equivocation region can be achieved by varying U alone. Conversely, we
show under a mild condition that if the main receiver is not more capable, then
V=X is strictly suboptimal. Next, we focus on the class of cyclic shift
symmetric wiretap channels. We explicitly determine the optimal selections of
rate splitting U and channel prefixing V that achieve the boundary of the
rate-equivocation region. We show that optimal U and V are determined via
cyclic shifts of the solution of an auxiliary optimization problem that
involves only one auxiliary random variable. In addition, we provide a
sufficient condition for cyclic shift symmetric wiretap channels to have U=\phi
as an optimal selection. Finally, we apply our results to the binary-input
cyclic shift symmetric wiretap channels. We solve the corresponding constrained
optimization problem by inspecting each point of the I(X;Y)-I(X;Z) function. We
thoroughly characterize the rate-equivocation regions of the BSC-BEC and
BEC-BSC wiretap channels. In particular, we find that U=\phi is optimal and the

primitives---specifically barriers, mutexes, and semaphores---and how they
apply to the GPU. Previous implementations are insufficient due to the
discrepancies in hardware and programming model of the GPU and CPU. We create
new implementations in CUDA and analyze the performance of spinning on the GPU,
as well as a method of sleeping on the GPU, by running a set of memory-system
benchmarks on two of the most common GPUs in use, the Tesla- and Fermi-class
GPUs from NVIDIA. From our results we define higher-level principles that are
valid for generic many-core processors, the most important of which is to limit
the number of atomic accesses required for a synchronization operation because
atomic accesses are slower than regular memory accesses. We use the results of
the benchmarks to critique existing synchronization algorithms and guide our
new implementations, and then define an abstraction of GPUs to classify any GPU
based on the behavior of the memory system. We use this abstraction to create
suitable implementations of the primitives specifically targeting the GPU, and
analyze the performance of these algorithms on Tesla and Fermi. We then predict
performance on future GPUs based on characteristics of the abstraction. We also
examine the roles of spin waiting and sleep waiting in each primitive and how
their performance varies based on the machine abstraction, then give a set of
guidelines for when each strategy is useful based on the characteristics of the
GPU and expected contention.

triplet field with the hypercharge of Y=1. In the Higgs triplet model, when the

the doubly-charged scalar boson decays into the same sign dilepton

level, yielding the measurement problem. On the other hand, recent progress in
cosmology has led to the ""multiverse"" picture, in which our observed universe
is only one of the many, bringing an apparent arbitrariness in defining
probabilities, called the measure problem.
  In this paper, we discuss how these two problems are intimately related with
each other, developing a complete picture for quantum measurement and
cosmological histories in the quantum mechanical universe. On one hand, quantum
mechanics eliminates the arbitrariness of defining probabilities in the
multiverse, as discussed in arXiv:1104.2324. On the other hand, the multiverse
allows for understanding why we observe an ordered world obeying consistent
laws of physics, by providing an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This
results in the irreversibility of quantum measurement, despite the fact that
the evolution of the multiverse state is unitary.
  In order to describe the cosmological dynamics correctly, we need to identify
the structure of the Hilbert space for a system with gravity. We argue that in
order to keep spacetime locality, the Hilbert space for dynamical spacetime
must be defined only in restricted spacetime regions: in and on the (stretched)
apparent horizon as viewed from a fixed reference frame. This requirement
arises from eliminating all the redundancies and overcountings in a general
relativistic, global spacetime description of nature. It is responsible for
horizon complementarity as well as the ""observer dependence"" of
horizons/spacetime---these phenomena arise to represent changes of the
reference frame in the relevant Hilbert space. This can be viewed as an
extension of the Poincare transformation in the quantum gravitational context,
as the Lorentz transformation is viewed as an extension of the Galilean
transformation.

by means of unresolved X-ray emission, and to constrain the presence of
clusters surrounding the FRI sources from the diffuse X-ray emission by the
associated hot plasma. Among 19 FRI candidates, 6 have an X-ray unresolved
counterpart in the C-COSMOS catalog. Two additional sources are not present in
the C-COSMOS catalog but are clearly detected in the Chandra images. X-ray
spectral analysis, when possible, or hardness ratio of the stacked emission
from X-ray detected sources, suggest that some of them have significant
intrinsic absorption (N_H~10^22 cm^-2), and high X-ray luminosities with
respect to local FRIs. From the stacking analysis of the 11 non-detected
sources, however, we find evidence for unresolved soft X-ray emission and no
detected hard emission, suggesting an unabsorbed spectrum. Therefore, the X-ray
properties vary significantly from source to source among these FRI candidates.
From the analysis of the stacked images of all 19 FRI candidates we can rule
out the presence of virialized haloes with temperatures larger than 2-3 keV;
however, the upper limit on the average extended emission is still consistent
with the presence of ~1-2 keV hot gas.

with adaptive mesh refinement that evolves the electromagnetic (EM) vector

to use any interpolation scheme on refinement level boundaries and still
guarantee that the magnetic field remains divergenceless. As in classical EM, a
gauge choice must be made when evolving A, and we chose a straightforward
""algebraic"" gauge condition to simplify the A evolution equation. However,
magnetized black hole-neutron star (BHNS) simulations in this gauge exhibit
unphysical behavior, including the spurious appearance of strong magnetic
fields on refinement level boundaries. This spurious behavior is exacerbated
when matter crosses refinement boundaries during tidal disruption of the NS.
Applying Kreiss-Oliger dissipation to the evolution of the magnetic vector
potential A slightly weakens this spurious magnetic effect, but with undesired
consequences. We demonstrate via an eigenvalue analysis and a numerical study
that zero-speed modes in the algebraic gauge, coupled with the frequency
filtering that occurs on refinement level boundaries, are responsible for the
creation of spurious magnetic fields. We show that the EM Lorenz gauge exhibits
no zero-speed modes, and as a consequence, spurious magnetic effects are
quickly propagated away, allowing for long-term, stable magnetized BHNS
evolutions. Our study demonstrates how the EM gauge degree of freedom can be
chosen to one's advantage, and that for magnetized BHNS simulations the Lorenz
gauge constitutes a major improvement over the algebraic gauge.

pressure and angular momentum of the accreting gas. We simulate accretion onto
intermediate-mass black holes, but we derive general scaling relationships that
are solutions of the Bondi problem with radiation feedback valid for any mass
of the BH $M_{\rm bh}$. Thermal pressure of the ionized sphere around the BH
regulates the accretion rate producing periodic and short-lived luminosity
bursts. We find that for ambient gas densities exceeding $n^{\rm cr}_{\rm
H,\infty} \propto M_{\rm bh}^{-1}$, the period of the oscillations decreases
rapidly and the duty cycle increases from 6%, in agreement with observations of
the fraction of active galactic nuclei at $z\sim 3$, to 50%. The mean accretion
rate becomes Eddington limited for $n_{\rm H,\infty}>n_{\rm H,\infty}^{\rm Edd}
\simeq n_{\rm H,\infty}^{\rm cr} T_{\infty,4}^{-1}$ where $T_{\infty,4}$ is the
gas temperature in units of $10^4$ K. In the sub-Eddington regime, the mean
accretion rate onto BHs is about $1% T_{\infty,4}^{2.5}$ of the Bondi rate,
thus is proportional to the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. The period
of the oscillations coincides with depletion timescale of the gas inside the
ionized bubble surrounding the BH. Gas depletion is dominated by a pressure
gradient pushing the gas outward if $n_{\rm H,\infty}<n^{\rm cr}_{\rm
H,\infty}$ and by accretion onto the BH otherwise. Generally, for $n_{\rm
H,\infty}<n^{\rm cr}_{\rm H,\infty}$ angular momentum does not affect
significantly the accretion rate and period of the oscillations.

(WL) peak counts, which we denote as `the hierarchical algorithm'. The idea of
this method is to combine information from WL maps sequentially smoothed with a
series of filters of different size, from the largest down to the smallest,
thus increasing the cosmological sensitivity of the resulting peak function. We
compare the cosmological constraints resulting from the peak abundance measured
in this way and the abundance obtained by using a filter of fixed size, which
is the standard practice in WL peak studies. For this purpose, we employ a
large set of WL maps generated by ray-tracing through N-body simulations, and
the Fisher matrix formalism. We find that if low-S/N peaks are included in the
analysis (S/N ~ 3), the hierarchical method yields constraints significantly
better than the single-sized filtering. For a large future survey such as
Euclid or LSST, combined with information from a CMB experiment like Planck,
the results for the hierarchical (single-sized) method are: \Delta n=0.0039
(0.004); \Delta \Omega m=0.002 (0.0045); \Delta \sigma 8=0.003 (0.006); \Delta
w=0.019 (0.0525). This forecast is conservative, as we assume no knowledge of
the redshifts of the lenses, and consider a single broad bin for the redshifts
of the sources. If only peaks with S/N >= 6 are considered, then there is
little difference between the results of the two methods. We also examine the
statistical properties of the hierarchical peak function: Its covariance matrix
has off-diagonal terms for bins with S/N <= 6 and aperture mass of M < 3 x
1e+14 Ms/h, the higher bins being largely uncorrelated and therefore well
described by a Poisson distribution.

pressure from stellar photons. The energetics and time-dependence are taken
directly from stellar evolution models. We implement these in simulations with
pc-scale resolution, modeling galaxies from SMC-like dwarfs and MW analogues to
massive z~2 starburst disks. Absent feedback, gas cools and collapses without
limit. With feedback, the ISM reaches a multi-phase steady state in which GMCs
continuously form, disperse, and re-form. Our primary results include: (1) Star
forming galaxies generically self-regulate at Toomre Q~1. Most of the volume is
in diffuse hot gas with most of the mass in dense GMC complexes. The phase
structure and gas mass at high densities are much more sensitive probes of
stellar feedback physics than integrated quantities (Toomre Q or gas velocity
dispersion). (2) Different feedback mechanisms act on different scales:
radiation & HII pressure are critical to prevent runaway collapse of dense gas
in GMCs. SNe and stellar winds dominate the dynamics of volume-filling hot gas;
however this primarily vents out of the disk. (3) The galaxy-averaged SFR is
determined by feedback. For given feedback efficiency, restricting star
formation to molecular gas or modifying the cooling function has little effect;
but changing feedback mechanisms directly translates to shifts off the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. (4) Self-gravity leads to marginally-bound GMCs
with an ~M^-2 mass function with a cutoff at the Jeans mass; they live a few
dynamical times before being disrupted by stellar feedback and turn ~1-10% of
their mass into stars (increasing from dwarfs through starburst galaxies).
Low-mass GMCs are preferentially unbound.

fast decline from maximum, which was initially missed, and its subsequent
development in the radio and X-ray wavelengths. This system also exhibits
properties similar to those of the much smaller class of recurrent novae;
themselves potential progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae. Aims. We aim to
determine the nature and physical parameters of the KT Eri progenitor system.
Methods. We searched the Harvard College Observatory archive plates for the
progenitor of KT Eri to determine the nature of the system, particularly the
evolutionary stage of the secondary.We used the data obtained to search for any
periodic signal and the derived luminosity to estimate a recurrence timescale.
Furthermore, by comparing the colours of the quiescent system on a
colour-magnitude diagram we may infer the nature of the secondary star.
Results. We identified the progenitor system of KT Eri and measured a quiescent
magnitude of < B >= 14.7 \pm 0.4. No previous outburst was found. However, we
suggest that if the nova is recurrent it should be on a timescale of centuries.
We find a periodicity at quiescence of 737 days which may arise from reflection
effects and/or eclipses in the central binary. The periodicity and the
quiescence magnitude of the system suggest that the secondary star is evolved

galactic super-winds that enrich the IGM and shape the galaxy mass function and
mass-metallicity relation. In previous papers, we introduced new numerical
methods for implementing stellar feedback on sub-GMC through galactic scales in
galaxy simulations. This includes radiation pressure (UV through IR), SNe
(Type-I & II), stellar winds ('fast' O-star through 'slow' AGB winds), and HII
photoionization. Here, we show that these feedback mechanisms drive galactic
winds with outflow rates as high as ~10-20 times the galaxy SFR. The
mass-loading efficiency (wind mass loss rate divided by SFR) scales inversely
with circular velocity, consistent with momentum-conservation expectations. We
study the contributions of each feedback mechanism to galactic winds in a range
of galaxy models, from SMC-like dwarfs & MW-analogues to z~2 clumpy disks. In
massive, gas-rich systems (local starbursts and high-z galaxies), radiation
pressure dominates the wind generation. For MW-like spirals and dwarf galaxies
the gas densities are much lower, and shock-heated gas from SNe and stellar
winds dominates production of large-scale outflows. In all models, however,
winds have a multi-phase structure that depends on interactions between
multiple feedback mechanisms operating on different spatial & time scales: any
single mechanism fails to reproduce the winds observed. We provide fitting
functions for wind mass-loading and velocities as a function of galaxy
properties, for use in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. These
differ from typically-adopted formulae with explicit dependence on gas surface
density that can be very important in both low-density dwarf galaxies and
high-density gas-rich galaxies.

reaches a state in which the radiative terms cancel each other in the mean in a
first approximation. The ensuing approximate statistical description reduced to

z=3.5673 and z=3.5774 (separation Delta v ~ 660 km/s), are dominated by the
neutral gas in the interstellar medium of the parent galaxies. From the singly
ionized zinc and sulfur, we estimate oversolar metallicities of [Zn/H]

respectively. These are the highest metallicities ever measured in galaxies at

merging, whose star formation and metallicity are heightened by the
interaction. This enhanced star formation might also have triggered the birth
of the GRB progenitor. As typically seen in star-forming galaxies, the
fine-structure absorption SiII* is detected, both in G0 and G1. From the

regions can be very efficient at injecting energy into clouds. This is partly a
magnetic effect: the magnetic energy added to a cloud by an HII region is
comparable to or larger than the kinetic energy, and magnetic fields can also
help collimate the ejected gas, increasing its energy yield. As a result of
these effects, a blister HII region expanding into a cloud with a magnetic
field perpendicular to its edge injects twice as much energy by 5 Myr as a
non-magnetized blister HII region driven by a star of the same luminosity.
Blister HII regions are also more efficient at injecting kinetic energy than
spherical HII regions, due to the recoil provided by escaping gas, but not by
as much as predicted by some analytic approximations.

shear modulus higher than that of the crust due to the high density and charge
separation, even allowing for the effects of charge screening. This may lead to
strong continuous gravitational-wave emission from rapidly rotating neutron
stars and gravitational-wave bursts associated with magnetar flares and pulsar
glitches. We present the first detailed calculation of the shear modulus of the
mixed phase. We describe the quark phase using the bag model plus first-order
quantum chromodynamics corrections and the hadronic phase using relativistic
mean-field models with parameters allowed by the most massive pulsar. Most of
the calculation involves treating the ""pasta phases"" of the lattice via
dimensional continuation, and we give a general method for computing
dimensionally continued lattice sums including the Debye model of charge
screening. We compute all the shear components of the elastic modulus tensor
and angle average them to obtain the effective (scalar) shear modulus for the
case where the mixed phase is a polycrystal. We include the contributions from
changing the cell size, which are necessary for the stability of the
lower-dimensional portions of the lattice. Stability also requires a minimum
surface tension, generally tens of MeV/fm^2 depending on the equation of state.
We find that the shear modulus can be a few times 10^33 erg/cm^3, two orders of
magnitude higher than the first estimate, over a significant fraction of the
maximum mass stable star for certain parameter choices.

tree search, have achieved tremendous success in model free reinforcement
learning. A combination of the so called upper confidence bounds policy to
preserve the ""exploration vs. exploitation"" balance to select actions for
sample evaluations together with massive computing power to store and to update
dynamically a rather large pre-evaluated game tree lead to the development of
software that has beaten the top human player in the game of Go on a 9 by 9
board. Much effort in the current research is devoted to widening the range of
applicability of the Monte-Carlo sampling methodology to partially observable
Markov decision processes with non-immediate payoffs. The main challenge
introduced by randomness and incomplete information is to deal with the action
evaluation at the chance nodes due to drastic differences in the possible
payoffs the same action could lead to. The aim of this article is to establish
a version of a theorem that originated from population genetics and has been
later adopted in evolutionary computation theory that will lead to novel
Monte-Carlo sampling algorithms that provably increase the AI potential. Due to
space limitations the actual algorithms themselves will be presented in the
sequel papers, however, the current paper provides a solid mathematical
foundation for the development of such algorithms and explains why they are so
promising.

purpose is to find a unified scheme which combines all existing methodology in

non-Markovian FBSDEs. An important device is a decoupling random field that is
regular (uniformly Lipschitz in its spatial variable). We show that the
regulariy of such decoupling field is closely related to the bounded solution
to an associated characteristic BSDE, a backward stochastic Riccati-type
equation with superlinear growth in both components $Y$ and $Z$. We establish
various sufficient conditions for the well-posedness of an ODE that dominates
the characteristic BSDE, which leads to the existence of the desired regular
decoupling random field, whence the solvability of the original FBSDE. A
synthetic analysis of the solvability is given, as a ""User's Guide,"" for a
large class of FBSDEs that are not covered by the existing methods. Some of
them have important implications in applications.

out of low mass (<10^6 solar masses) halos coherently on scales of a few
comoving Mpc. It has been argued that this will have a large impact on the
21-cm signal before and after reionization, as it raises the minimum mass
required to form ionizing sources. Using a semi-numerical code, we show that
the impact of the baryon streaming effect on the 21-cm signal during
reionization (redshifts z approximately 7-20) depends strongly on the cooling
scenario assumed for star formation, and the corresponding virial temperature
or mass at which stars form. For the canonical case of atomic hydrogen cooling
at 10^4 Kelvin, the minimum mass for star formation is well above the mass of
halos that are affected by the baryon streaming and there are no major changes
to existing predictions. For the case of molecular hydrogen cooling, we find
that reionization is delayed by a change in redshift of approximately 2 and
that more relative power is found in large modes at a given ionization
fraction. However, the delay in reionization is degenerate with astrophysical
assumptions, such as the production rate of UV photons by stars.

observed in UV 1600{\AA} by Transition Region and Coronal Explorer and in HXRs
by Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager. HXR (25-100 keV)
imaging observations show two kernels of size (FWHM) 15?? moving along the two
UV ribbons. We find the following results. (1) UV brightening is substantially
enhanced wherever and whenever the compact HXR kernel is passing, and during
the HXR transit across a certain region, the UV count light curve in that
region is temporally correlated with the HXR total flux light curve. After the
passage of the HXR kernel, the UV light curve exhibits smooth monotonical
decay. (2)We measure the apparent motion speed of the HXR sources and UV ribbon
fronts, and decompose the motion into parallel and perpendicular motions with
respect to the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL). It is found that HXR
kernels and UV fronts exhibit similar apparent motion patterns and speeds. The
parallel motion dominates during the rise of the HXR emission, and the
perpendicular motion starts and dominates at the HXR peak, the apparent motion
speed being 10-40 km s-1. (3) We also find that UV emission is characterized by
a rapid rise correlated with HXRs, followed by a long decay on timescales of
15-30 minutes. The above analysis provides evidence that UV brightening is
primarily caused by beam heating, which also produces thick-target HXR
emission. The thermal origin of UV emission cannot be excluded, but would
produce weaker heating by one order of magnitude. The extended UV ribbons in
this event are most likely a result of sequential reconnection along the PIL,
which produces individual flux tubes (post-flare loops), subsequent non-thermal
energy release and heating in these flux tubes, and then the very long cooling
time of the transition region at the feet of these flux tubes.

from the highly rotationally excited CO (up to Eup=4000 K) and H2O emission (up
to 600 K) detected by the Herschel Space Observatory in embedded low-mass
protostars. Our aim is to construct a model that reproduces the observations
quantitatively, to investigate the origin of the emission, and to use the lines
as probes of the various heating mechanisms.
  Methods. The model consists of a spherical envelope with a bipolar outflow
cavity. Three heating mechanisms are considered: passive heating by the
protostellar luminosity, UV irradiation of the outflow cavity walls, and C-type
shocks along the cavity walls. Line fluxes are calculated for CO and H2O and
compared to Herschel data and complementary ground-based data for the
protostars NGC1333 IRAS2A, HH 46 and DK Cha. The three sources are selected to
span a range of evolutionary phases and physical characteristics.
  Results. The passively heated gas in the envelope accounts for 3-10% of the
CO luminosity summed over all rotational lines up to J=40-39; it is best probed
by low-J CO isotopologue lines such as C18O 2-1 and 3-2. The UV-heated gas and
the C-type shocks, probed by 12CO 10-9 and higher-J lines, contribute 20-80%
each. The model fits show a tentative evolutionary trend: the CO emission is
dominated by shocks in the youngest source and by UV-heated gas in the oldest
one. This trend is mainly driven by the lower envelope density in more evolved
sources. The total H2O line luminosity in all cases is dominated by shocks
(>99%). The exact percentages for both species are uncertain by at least a
factor of 2 due to uncertainties in the gas temperature as function of the
incident UV flux. However, on a qualitative level, both UV-heated gas and
C-type shocks are needed to reproduce the emission in far-infrared rotational
lines of CO and H2O.

newly developed families of solvable multi-parameter single-asset diffusions
with a nonlinear smile-shaped volatility and an affine drift. Our multi-asset
pricing model arises by employing copula methods. In particular, all discounted
single-asset price processes are modeled as martingale diffusions under a
risk-neutral measure. The price processes are so-called UOU diffusions and they
are each generated by combining a variable (Ito) transformation with a measure
change performed on an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (Gaussian) process.
Consequently, we exploit the use of a normal bridge copula for coupling the
single-asset dynamics while reducing the distribution of the multi-asset price
process to a multivariate normal distribution. Such an approach allows us to
simulate multidimensional price paths in a precise and fast manner and hence to
price path-dependent financial derivatives such as Asian-style and Bermudan
options using the Monte Carlo method. We also demonstrate how to successfully
calibrate our multi-asset pricing model by fitting respective equity option and
asset market prices to the single-asset models and their return correlations

take advantage of quantum randomization devices. In games of full information,
the resulting equilibria are always correlated equilibria, but not all
correlated equilibria appear as quantum equilibria. The classical and quantum
theories diverge further in games of private information. In the quantum
context, we show that Kuhn's equivalence between behavioral and mixed
strategies breaks down. As a result, quantum technology allows players to
achieve outcomes that would not be achievable with any classical technology
short of direct communication; in particular they do not occur as correlated
equilibria.
  In general, in games of private information, quantum technology allows
players to achieve outcomes that are Pareto superior to any classical
correlated equilibrium, but not necessarily Pareto optimal. A simple economic
example illustrates these points.

luminous radio-quite quasar PG 1416-129. Our new spectra with high quality
cover both H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ regions, and show negligible line profile
variation within a timescale of one year. The two spectra allow us to study the
variability of the Balmer line profile by comparing the spectra with the
previous ones taken at 10 and 20 years ago. By decomposing the broad Balmer
emission lines into two Gaussian profiles, our spectral analysis suggests a
strong response to the continuum level for the very broad component, and
significant variations in both bulk blueshift velocity/FWHM and flux for the
broad component. The new observations additionally indicate flat Balmer
decrements (i.e., too strong H$\beta$ emission) at the line wings, which is
hard to be reproduced by recent optically thin models. With these observations
we argue that a separate inner optically thin emission-line region might not be
necessary in the object to reproduce the observed line profiles.

through which the predictability of user behavior is exploited to balance the
wireless traffic over time, and hence, significantly reduce the bandwidth
required to achieve a given blocking/outage probability. We start with a simple
model in which the smart wireless devices are assumed to predict the arrival of
new requests and submit them to the network T time slots in advance. Using
tools from large deviation theory, we quantify the resulting prediction
diversity gain} to establish that the decay rate of the outage event
probabilities increases with the prediction duration T. This model is then
generalized to incorporate the effect of the randomness in the prediction
look-ahead time T. Remarkably, we also show that, in the cognitive networking
scenario, the appropriate use of proactive resource allocation by the primary
users improves the diversity gain of the secondary network at no cost in the
primary network diversity. We also shed lights on multicasting with predictable
demands and show that the proactive multicast networks can achieve a
significantly higher diversity gain that scales super-linearly with T. Finally,
we conclude by a discussion of the new research questions posed under the
umbrella of the proposed proactive (non-causal) wireless networking framework.

quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacs, low synchrotron, or high synchrotron peaked objects
according to a varying mix of the Doppler boosted radiation from the jet, the
emission from the accretion disk, the broad line region, and the light from the
host galaxy. In this framework the peak energy of the synchrotron power
(nu_peak) in blazars is independent of source type and of radio luminosity. We
test this new approach, which builds upon unified schemes, using extensive
Monte Carlo simulations and show that it can provide simple answers to a number
of long-standing issues including, amongst others, the different cosmological
evolution of BL Lacs selected in the radio and X-ray bands, the larger nu_peak
values observed in BL Lacs, the fact that high synchrotron peaked blazars are
always of the BL Lac type, and the existence of FSRQ/BL Lac transition objects.
Objects so far classified as BL Lacs on the basis of their observed weak, or
undetectable, emission lines are of two physically different classes:
intrinsically weak lined objects, more common in X-ray selected samples, and
heavily diluted broad lined sources, more frequent in radio selected samples,
which explains some of the confusion in the literature. We also show that
strong selection effects are the main cause of the diversity observed in radio
and X-ray samples, and that the correlation between luminosity and nu_peak,
that led to the proposal of the ""blazar sequence"", is also a selection effect
arising from the comparison of shallow radio and X-ray surveys, and to the fact
that high nu_peak-high radio power objects have never been considered because
their redshift is not measurable.

consistent \textit{kinetic} treatment of slowly-time varying plasma states
occurring in collisionless and magnetized axisymmetric plasmas. The
phenomenology may include finite pressure anisotropies as well as strong
toroidal and poloidal differential rotation, characteristic of Tokamak plasmas.
Despite the fact that physical phenomena occurring in fusion plasmas depend
fundamentally on the microscopic particle phase-space dynamics, their
consistent kinetic treatment remains still essentially unchalleged to date. The
goal of this paper is to address the problem within the framework of
Vlasov-Maxwell description. The gyrokinetic treatment of charged particles
dynamics is adopted for the construction of asymptotic solutions for the
quasi-stationary species kinetic distribution functions. These are expressed in
terms of the particle exact and adiabatic invariants. The theory relies on a
perturbative approach, which permits to construct asymptotic analytical
solutions of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. In this way, both diamagnetic and
energy corrections are included consistently into the theory. In particular, by
imposing suitable kinetic constraints, the existence of generalized
bi-Maxwellian asymptotic kinetic equilibria is pointed out. The theory applies
for toroidal rotation velocity of the order of the ion thermal speed. These
solutions satisfy identically also the constraints imposed by the Maxwell
equations, i.e. quasi-neutrality and Ampere's law. As a result, it is shown
that, in the presence of non-uniform fluid and EM fields, these kinetic
equilibria can sustain simultaneously toroidal differential rotation,
quasi-stationary finite poloidal flows and temperature anisotropy.

characterized, little has been done about quantifying spectral variations over
the surface. Any spectral variation would give us insights on the geographical
variation of the composition and/or the surface age. The only work so far was
that of Rivkin & Volquardsen (2010, Icarus 206, 327) who reported
rotationally-resolved spectroscopic (disk-integrated) observations in the
2.2-4.0 {\mu}m range; their observations showed evidence for a relatively
uniform surface. Here, we report disk-resolved observations of Ceres with
SINFONI (ESO VLT) in the 1.17-1.32 {\mu}m and 1.45-2.35 {\mu}m wavelength
ranges. The observations were made under excellent seeing conditions (0.6""),
allowing us to reach a spatial resolution of ~75 km on Ceres' surface. We do
not find any spectral variation above a 3% level, suggesting a homogeneous
surface at our spatial resolution. Slight variations (about 2%) of the spectral
slope are detected, geographically correlated with the albedo markings reported
from the analysis of the HST and Keck disk-resolved images of Ceres (Li et al.,

innovations, or products are competing with one another for their social
influence in a networked society. In this paper, we study competitive influence
propagation in social networks under the competitive linear threshold (CLT)
model, an extension to the classic linear threshold model. Under the CLT model,
we focus on the problem that one entity tries to block the influence
propagation of its competing entity as much as possible by strategically
selecting a number of seed nodes that could initiate its own influence
propagation. We call this problem the influence blocking maximization (IBM)
problem. We prove that the objective function of IBM in the CLT model is
submodular, and thus a greedy algorithm could achieve 1-1/e approximation
ratio. However, the greedy algorithm requires Monte-Carlo simulations of
competitive influence propagation, which makes the algorithm not efficient. We
design an efficient algorithm CLDAG, which utilizes the properties of the CLT
model, to address this issue. We conduct extensive simulations of CLDAG, the
greedy algorithm, and other baseline algorithms on real-world and synthetic
datasets. Our results show that CLDAG is able to provide best accuracy in par
with the greedy algorithm and often better than other algorithms, while it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the greedy algorithm.

The v-nodes, called centers,

a bow-tie scheme and possesses interesting properties. Namely, this
organization creates feedback loops that are capable to generate any prescribed
patterning dynamics, chaotic or periodic, and create a number of equilibrium
states. We show that activation or silencing of a node can sharply switch the
network attractor, even if the activated or silenced node is weakly connected.
We distinguish between two dynamically different situations, ""power of center""

response is fast. Using a simple network example we show that a centralized
network is more robust with respect to time dependent perturbations, in the PC
relative to the SP case. In theoretical molecular biology, this class of models
can be used to reveal a non-trivial relation between the architecture of
protein-DNA and protein-protein interaction networks and controllability of

\textit{g}-factor but leaving room for an easy-axis exchange anisotropy. Within
the isotropic $J_1$-$J_2$ spin model our experimental data are described by
various theoretical approaches yielding values for the exchange interactions
$J_1$ $\sim$ -100\,K and $J_2$ $\sim$ 36\,K. These main intrachain exchange

previous studies in the literature and shift the frustration ratio $\alpha =
J_2/|J_1|$ $\approx$ 0.36 of linarite closer to the 1D critical point at 0.25.
Electron spin resonance (ESR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements
further prove that the static susceptibility is dominated by the intrinsic spin
susceptibility. The Knight shift as well as the broadening of the linewidth in
ESR and NMR at elevated temperatures indicate a highly frustrated system with

called coupled-physics inverse problems of multi-wave inverse problems. Inverse
problems tend to be most useful in, e.g., medical and geophysical imaging, when
they combine high contrast with high resolution. In some settings, a single
modality displays either high contrast or high resolution but not both. In
favorable situations, physical effects couple one modality with high contrast
with another modality with high resolution. The mathematical analysis of such
couplings forms the class of hybrid inverse problems.
  Hybrid inverse problems typically involve two steps. In a first step, a
well-posed problem involving the high-resolution low-contrast modality is
solved from knowledge of boundary measurements. In a second step, a
quantitative reconstruction of the parameters of interest is performed from
knowledge of the point-wise, internal, functionals of the parameters
reconstructed during the first step. This paper reviews mathematical techniques
that have been developed in recent years to address the second step.
  Mathematically, many hybrid inverse problems find interpretations in terms of
linear and nonlinear (systems of) equations. In the analysis of such equations,
one often needs to verify that qualitative properties of solutions to elliptic
linear equations are satisfied, for instance the absence of any critical
points. This paper reviews several methods to prove that such qualitative
properties hold, including the method based on the construction of complex
geometric optics solutions.

equation (the connecting operators). For the space-time manifold (n = 4), these
operators, connecting the tangent and spinor bundle, are operators that are
represented by the Dirac matrices in the special basis. Reduced connecting
operators are represented by the Pauli matrices. In order to uniquely prolong
the Killing equation from the tangent bundle onto the spinor bundle over the
space-time manifold, it is necessary to pass to the complexification of the
manifold and the corresponding bundles, and then to pass to the real
representation. Returning the reverse motion, one can already obtain two copies
of the spinor bundle. Their set (the pair-spinor) allows to construct the Lie
operator analogues for the spinors (and the pair-spinors). Similar procedure is
feasible for any even n. For n=6, the specified formalism is closely connected
with the Bogolyubov-Valatin transformations. For n mod 8=0, being based on the
Bott periodicity, the reduced connecting operators generate the structural
constants of an hypercomplex algebra (without division for n> 8) with the
alternative-elastic, flexible (Jordan), and ""norm"" identities. For n = 8, such
the algebra is the octonion algebra. In addition, in the article the various

of 'similarity', which has been introduced as an equivalence relation in a
previous paper (see \cite{rom11}). First we write the Hamiltonian function, the
equations of motion in canonical form, and then using a generating function, we
obtain the transformed equations of motion. After the coordinates
transformations, we introduce the fictitious time, to regularize the equations
of motion. Explicit formulas are given for the regularization in the coordinate
systems centered in the more massive and the less massive star of the binary
system. The 'similar' polar angle's definition is introduced, in order to
analyze the regularization's geometrical transformation. The effect of
Levi-Civita's transformation is described in a geometrical manner. Using the

number of additional relay nodes (to minimize network cost) at a subset of
given potential relay locations, in order to convey the data from already
existing sensor nodes (hereafter called source nodes) to a Base Station, while
meeting a certain specified hop count bound (the hop count bound is chosen to
ensure a pre-determined probability of the data being delivered to the BS

  First we sudy the problem of guaranteed QoS connected network design, where
the objective is to have at least one path from each source to the BS with the
specified hop count bound. We show that the problem is NP-Hard. For a problem
in which the number of existing sensor nodes and potential relay locations is
n, we propose an O(n) approximation algorithm of polynomial time complexity.
Results show that the algorithm performs efficiently (in over 90% of the tested
scenarios, it gave solutions that were either optimal or were worse than
optimal by just one relay) in various randomly generated network scenarios.
  Next, we study the problem of survivable network design with guaranteed QoS,
i.e, the requirement is to have at least k > 1 node disjoint hop constrained
paths from each source to the BS. We show that the problem is NP-Hard. We also
show that the problem of finding a feasible solution to this optimization
problem is NP-Complete. We propose two polynomial time heuristics for this

a charged classical particle confined bi-harmonically in a plane with a uniform
static magnetic field directed perpendicular to the plane. The stochastic
dynamics gives a steady state in the long-time limit. We have examined the
orbital magnetic effect of introducing a parametrized deviation ($\eta$ -1)
from the second fluctuation-dissipation (II-FD) relation that connects the
driving noise and the frictional memory kernel in the standard Langevin
dynamics. The main result obtained here is that the moving charged particle
generates a finite orbital magnetic moment in the steady state, and that the
moment shows a crossover from para-to dia-magnetic sign as the parameter $\eta$
is varied. It is zero for $\eta = 1$ that makes the steady state correspond to
equilibrium, as it should. The magnitude of the orbital magnetic moment turns
out to be a non-monotonic function of the applied magnetic field, tending to
zero in the limit of an infinitely large as well as an infinitesimally small
magnetic field. These results are discussed in the context of the classic
Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem on the absence of classical orbital diamagnetism.
Possible realization is also briefly discussed.

resolution between the H-alpha line emission observed with a Multi-channel
Subtractive Double Pass (MSDP) spectrograph on the Large Coronagraph and
Horizontal Telescope at Bialkow Observatory, Poland, and HXR emission recorded
by the RHESSI spacecraft during several flares, greatly extending our earlier
analysis (Paper I) to flares between 2003 and 2005. Results. For 16 H-alpha
flaring kernels, observed in 12 solar flares, we made 72 measurements of time
delays between local maxima of the RHESSI X-ray and H-alpha emissions. For most
kernels, there is an excellent correlation between time variations in the
H-alpha line emission (at line centre and in the line wings) and HXR (20-50
keV) flux, with the H-alpha emission following features in the HXR light curves
generally by a short time lapse delta t = 1-2 s, sometimes significantly longer
(10-18 s). We also found a strong spatial correlation. Conclusions. Owing to
our larger number of time measurements than in previous studies, the
distribution of delta t values shows a much clearer pattern, with many examples
of short (1-2 s) delays of the H-alpha emission, but with some flares showing
longer (10-18 s) delays. The former are consistent with energy transfer along
the flaring loop legs by non-thermal electron beams, the latter to the passage

along the lower part of the zero age main sequence (ZAMS). We first compute a
sequence of stellar models with masses from 0.3 to 1.5 solar masses. We then
construct mean field models of their outer convection zones and compute
differential rotation and meridional flows by solving the Reynolds equation
with transport coefficients from the second order correlation approximation.
For a fixed rotation period of 2.5 d we find a strong dependence of the surface
differential rotation on the effective temperature with weak surface shear for
M dwarfs and very large values for F stars. The increase with effective
temperature is modest below 6000 K but very steep above 6000 K. The meridional
flow shows a similar variation with temperature but the increase with
temperature is not quite so steep. Both the surface rotation and the meridional
circulation are solar-type over the entire temperature range. We also study the
dependence of differential rotation and meridional flow on the rotation period
for masses. from 0.3 to 1.1 solar masses. The variation of the differential
rotation with period is weak except for very rapid rotation. The meridional
flow shows a systematic increase of the flow speed with the rotation rate.
Numerical experiments in which either the $\Lambda$ effect is dropped in the
Reynolds stress or the baroclinic term in the equation of motion is cancelled
show that for effective temperatures below 6000 K the Reynolds stress is the
dominant driver of differential rotation.

known as pulse jitter. In this paper, we investigate the stability of
integrated pulse profiles for 5 MSPs, and estimate the amount of jitter for PSR

of observing frequency and bandwidth around 1.4 GHz on frequency scales of <100
MHz, which supports the idea that pulses within narrow frequency scale are
equally jittered. In addition, we point out that pulse jitter would limit TOA
calculation for the timing observations with future telescopes like the Square

all of its minimal $s-t$ separators up to a certain fixed size $k$. This
technique allows us to solve $s-t$ Cut and Multicut problems with various
additional restrictions (e.g., the vertices being removed from the graph form
an independent set or induce a connected graph) in linear time for every fixed
number $k$ of removed vertices.
  Our results have applications for problems that are not directly defined by
separators, but the known solution methods depend on some variant of
separation. for example, we can solve similarly restricted generalizations of
Bipartization (delete at most $k$ vertices from $G$ to make it bipartite) in
almost linear time for every fixed number $k$ of removed vertices. These
results answer a number of open questions in the area of parameterized
complexity. Furthermore, our technique turns out to be relevant for $(H,C,K)$-
and $(H,C,\le K)$-coloring problems as well, which are cardinality constrained
variants of the classical $H$-coloring problem. We make progress in the
classification of the parameterized complexity of these problems by identifying
new cases that can be solved in almost linear time for every fixed cardinality
bound.

investigated with studies of individual, nearby, sources, and only a few
ensemble analyses have been applied to large samples in wide ranges of
luminosity and redshift. We want to determine the ensemble variability
properties of two serendipitously selected AGN samples extracted from the
catalogues of XMM-Newton and Swift, with redshift between ~0.2 and ~4.5, and
X-ray luminosities, in the 0.5-4.5 keV band, between ~10^43 erg/s and ~10^46
erg/s. We use the structure function (SF), which operates in the time domain,
and allows for an ensemble analysis even when only a few observations are
available for individual sources and the power spectral density (PSD) cannot be
derived. SF is also more appropriate than fractional variability and excess
variance, because such parameters are biased by the duration of the monitoring
time interval in the rest-frame, and thus by cosmological time dilation. We
find statistically consistent results for the two samples, with the SF
described by a power law of the time lag, approximately as SF \propto tau^0.1.
We do not find evidence of the break in the SF, at variance with the case of
lower luminosity AGNs. We confirm a strong anti-correlation of the variability
with X-ray luminosity, accompanied by a change of the slope of the SF. We find
evidence in support of a weak, intrinsic, average increase of X-ray variability
with redshift. The change of amplitude and slope of the SF with X-ray
luminosity provides new constraints on both single oscillator models and
multiple subunits models of variability.

temperature-dependent correction to the GL parameter at which the surface
energy becomes zero, and analytically, the temperature dependence of the
thermodynamic critical field. We demonstrate that the EGL formalism is not just
a mathematical extension to the theory - variations of both the gap and the
thermodynamic critical field with temperature calculated within the EGL theory
are found in very good agreement with the full BCS results down to low

the tunneling rate increases in general in comparison with the single field

is also achieved on the graphene-covered surface, which means that the electron
density in the vacuum above graphene is substantially spin-polarized. In
accordance with our ab initio calculations we find an enhanced atomic
corrugation with respect to the bare surface, due to the presence of the carbon
pz orbitals and as a result of the quenching of Ni surface states. The latter
also leads to an inversion of spinpolarization with respect to the pristine
surface. Room temperature Kerr microscopy shows a stripe like domain pattern
with stripe widths of 3 - 6 {\mu}m. Applying in-plane-fields, domain walls
start to move at about 13 mT and a single domain state is achieved at 140 mT.
Via scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis (SEMPA) a second
type of modulation within the stripes is found and identified as 330 nm wide

leave a digital trace and affect other people's actions. This has lead to the
emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer
science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of
disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important
discovery is that query volumes (i.e., the number of requests submitted by
users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases, to
anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful exemples include
unemployment levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent
works applied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it
remains unclear if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the
collective wisdom of on-line users on the web. Here we show that trading
volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with the volumes of
queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in
many cases peaks of trading by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on
a unique dataset of queries, submitted to an important web search engine, which
enable us to investigate also the user behavior. We show that the query volume
dynamics emerges from the collective but seemingly uncoordinated activity of
many users. These findings contribute to the debate on the identification of
early warnings of financial systemic risk, based on the activity of users of
the www.

obtained. Ensembles of packings with different mean packing fractions are
created by tapping the system at different intensities. Surprisingly, packing
fraction is not a good indicator of the ability of the deposit to jam a given
orifice. Different mean avalanche sizes are obtained for deposits with the same
mean packing fraction that were prepared with very different tap intensities.
It has been speculated that the number and size of arches in the bulk of the
granular column should be correlated with the ability of the system to jam a
small opening. We show that this correlation, if exists, is rather poor. A
comparison between bulk arches and jamming arches (i.e., arches that block the
opening) reveals that the aperture imposes a lower cut-off on the horizontal
span of the arches which is greater than the actual size of the opening. This
is related to the fact that blocking arches have to have the appropriate
orientation to fit the gap between two piles of grains resting at each side of
the aperture.

the anisotropic component is marginally distinguishable between the two types

rescaled by $g$ and conditioned on non-extinction converges in distribution
towards $\nu$. If the study of quasi-stationary distributions is easy and
follows mainly from a previous result by Bertoin and Yor \cite{BYFacExp} and
Berg \cite{bergI}, that of Yaglom limits is more challenging. We will see that
a Yaglom limit exits if and only if the extinction time at 0 of the process is
in the domain of attraction of an extreme law and we will then treat separately
three cases, according whether the extinction time is in the domain of
attraction of a Gumbel law, a Weibull law or a Fr\'echet law. In each of these
cases, necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters of the underlying
L\'evy process are given for the extinction time to be in the required domain
of attraction. The limit of the process conditioned to be positive is then
characterized by a multiplicative equation which is connected to a
factorization of the exponential distribution in the Gumbel case, a
factorization of a Beta distribution in the Weibull case and a factorization of
a Pareto distribution in the Fr\'echet case. This approach relies partly on
results on the tail distribution of the extinction time, which is known to be
distributed as the exponential integral of a L\'evy process. In that aim, new
results on such tail distributions are given, which may be of independent
interest. Last, we present applications of the Fr\'echet case to a family of

design of electromagnetic media with tailored optical properties. In this
paper, we focus on the formal structure of TO theory. By using a complete
covariant formalism, we present a general transformation law that holds for
arbitrary materials including bianisotropic, magneto-optical, nonlinear and
moving media. Due to the principle of general covariance, the formalism is
applicable to arbitrary space-time coordinate transformations and automatically
accounts for magneto-electric coupling terms. The formalism is demonstrated for
the calculation of the second harmonic generation in a twisted TO concentrator.

larger population of transient coorbitals; 129 (94) MBAs undergo episodes of
co-orbital libration with Ceres (Vesta) within a 2 Myr interval centred on the
present. The lifetime in the resonance is typically a few times 10^5 yr butcan
exceed 2*10^6 yr. The variational properties of the orbits of several
co-orbitals were examined. It was found that their present states with respect
to the secondary are well determined but knowledge of it is lost typically
after ~2*10^5 years. Objects initially deeper into the coorbital region
maintain their coorbital state for longer. Using the model of Namouni et al.
(1999) we show that their dynamics are similar to those of temporary coorbital
NEAs of the Earth and Venus. As in that case, the lifetime of resonant
libration is dictated by planetary secular perturbations, the inherent
chaoticity of the orbits and close encounters with massive objects other than
the secondary. In particular we present evidence that, while in the coorbital
state, close encounters with the secondary are generally avoided and that Ceres
affects the stability of tadpole librators of Vesta. Finally we demonstrate the
existence of Quasi-satellite orbiters of both Ceres and Vesta and conclude that
decametre-sized objects detected in the vicinity of Vesta by the DAWN mission
may, in fact, belong to this dynamical class rather than be bona-fide (i.e.
keplerian) satellites of Vesta.

initially porous material on the thermal evolution of planetesimals, and to
constrain the values of basic parameters that determined the structure and
evolution of the H chondrite parent body. A new code is presented for modeling
the thermal evolution of ordinary chondrite parent bodies that initially are
highly porous and undergo sintering by hot pressing as they are heated by decay
of radioactive nuclei. The pressure and temperature stratification in the
interior of the bodies is calculated by solving the equations of hydrostatic
equilibrium and energy transport. The decrease of porosity of the granular
material by hot pressing due to self-gravity is followed by solving a set of
equations for the sintering of powder materials. For the heat conductivity of
granular material we combine recently measured data for highly porous powder
materials, relevant for the surface layers of planetesimals, with data for heat
conductivity of chondrite material, relevant for the strongly sintered material
in deeper layers. To demonstrate the capability of our new model, the thermal
evolution of the H chondrite parent body was reconstructed. The model starts
with a porous body that is later compacted first by 'cold pressing' at low
temperatures and then by 'hot pressing' for temperatures above \approx 700 K,
i.e., the threshold temperature for sintering of silicates. The thermal model
was fitted to the well constrained cooling histories of the two H chondrites

linear sizes of the extended emission lie in the range from ~ 115 to ~ 250 AU.
The estimated black body temperatures from the 100 and 160 micron fluxes are
$\lesssim$ 22 K, while the fractional luminosity of the cold dust is
Ldust/Lstar ~ 10E-6, close to the luminosity of the Solar-System's Kuiper belt.
These debris discs are the coldest and faintest discs discovered so far around
mature stars and cannot easily be explained by invoking ""classical"" debris disc
models.

velocity, for two classes of X-ray outflows in a large sample of active
galactic nuclei has been performed. We find that line radiation pressure could
be one physical mechanism that might accelerate the gas we observe in warm
absorber, v~100-1000 km/s, and on comparable but less stringent grounds the
ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), v~0.03-0.3c. If comparable with the escape velocity
of the system; the first is naturally located at distances of the dusty torus,
~ 1 pc, and the second at sub-parsec scales, ~ 0.01 pc, in accordance with
large set of observational evidence existing in the literature. The
presentation of this relationship might give us key clues for our understanding
of the different physical mechanisms acting in the center of galaxies, the
feedback process and its impact on the evolution of the host galaxy.

laser coupled into the cavity mode. We show that with a resonant pump laser
coupling the cavity-confined four-level atoms from free space, the narrow
transmission peak of the cavity EIT is split into two peaks. The two peaks
represent the dressed intra-cavity dark states and have a frequency separation
approximately equal to the Rabi frequency of the free-space pump laser. We
observed experimentally the dressed intra-cavity dark states in cold Rb atoms
confined in a cavity and the experimental results agree with theoretical
calculations based on a semiclassical analysis.

into account the proportionality relation between one of the components of
shear scalar $(\sigma^{1}_{1})$ and expansion scalar $(\vartheta)$, which, for
some suitable choices of problem parameters, yields time dependent equation of
state (EoS) and deceleration parameter (DP), representing a model which
generates a transition of universe from early decelerating phase to present
accelerating phase. The physical and geometrical behavior of universe have been
discussed in detail.

consumer values are variable, in this case can be formalized as a generalized

has been shown that in the general case the quantum-mechanical formalism of the
theory of selective measurements is required for description of such
