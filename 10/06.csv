exhibit anisotropies that are correlated with the event-by-event orientation of
the reaction plane. Several methods were employed to extract the strength of
the signal: the event-plane, cumulant and Lee-Yang Zeros methods. These methods
have different sensitivity to correlations that are not caused by the
collective motion in the system (non-flow correlations due to jets, resonance
decays, and quantum correlations). The second Fourier coefficient of the
charged hadron azimuthal distributions was measured as a function of transverse
momentum, pseudorapidity and centrality in a broad kinematic range: $0.3 < p_T
< 12.0$ GeV/c, $|\eta| < 2.4$, as a function of collision centrality. In
addition, the third through sixth Fourier components were measured at
midrapidity using selected methods.

proven to be both in NP and in NP-Hard. To prove that this is the case the
paper shows that, not only do the kinds of possible moves that can be reversed
prove this, but it is also shown that no spider solitaire game of size n will
take more than a polynomial number of moves to complete if such a completion is

systems cannot be distributed at will - if one system A is maximally entangled
with another system B, it cannot be entangled at all to a third system C. This
concept, known as the monogamy of entanglement, manifests when the entanglement
of A with a pair BC, can be divided as contributions of entanglement between A
and B and A and C, plus a term \tau_{ABC} involving genuine tripartite
entanglement and so expected to be always positive. A very important measure in
Quantum Information Theory, the Entanglement of Formation (EOF), fails to
satisfy this last requirement. Here we present the reasons for that and show a
set of conditions that an arbitrary pure tripartite state must satisfy for EOF
to become a monogamous measure, ie, for \tau_{ABC} \ge 0. The relation derived
is connected to the discrepancy between quantum and classical correlations,
being \tau_{ABC} negative whenever the quantum correlation prevails over the
classical one. This result is employed to elucidate features of the
distribution of entanglement during a dynamical evolution. It also helps to
relate all monogamous instances of EOF to the Squashed Entanglement, an always
monogamous entanglement measure.

frame measures, but with certain restrictions. We investigate some general

show that the Beurling dimension is invariant under convolution (with a

achieves comparable performance to other DDoS mitigation schemes while
providing benefits when deployed only in the server's local network and its
upstream ISP, where local business objectives may incentivize deployment.
Mirage does not require source end hosts to install any software to access
Mirage protected websites. Unlike previous proposals, Mirage only requires
functionality from routers that is already deployed in today's routers, though
this functionality may need to be scaled depending on the point of deployment.
  Our approach is that end hosts can thwart the attackers by employing the
principle of a moving target: end hosts in our architecture periodically change
IP addresses to keep the attackers guessing. Knowledge of an active IP address
of the destination end host can act as an implicit authorization to send data.
We evaluate Mirage using theoretical analysis, simulations and a prototype
implementation on PlanetLab. We find that our design provides a first step
towards a deployable, yet effective DDoS defense.

intergalactic medium (IGM). The energy deposited into the interstellar medium
by supernovae and active galactic nuclei can accelerate the gas past the escape
velocity, and eject it into the IGM. This will affect the subsequent evolution
of the galaxy, by reducing or eliminating star formation, and quenching the
accretion of matter onto the central AGN. Galactic outflows is the main process
by which energy and processed interstellar matter is transported into the IGM.
This affects the subsequent formation of other galaxies. The energy carried by
outflows can strip protogalactic halos of their gas, preventing galaxies from
forming. Conversely, the metals carried by outflows can modify the composition
and cooling rates of the gas in protogalactic halos, favoring the formation of
galaxies. In this paper, I review the various techniques used to simulate
galactic outflows and their impact on galaxy and IGM evolution.

  Hierarchies",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work is concerned with approximating constraint satisfaction problems
(CSPs) with an additional global cardinality constraints. For example, \maxcut
is a boolean CSP where the input is a graph $G = (V,E)$ and the goal is to find
a cut $S \cup \bar S = V$ that maximizes the numberof crossing edges,
$|E(S,\bar S)|$. The \maxbisection problem is a variant of \maxcut with an
additional global constraint that each side of the cut has exactly half the
vertices, i.e., $|S| = |V|/2$. Several other natural optimization problems like
\minbisection and approximating Graph Expansion can be formulated as CSPs with
global constraints.
  In this work, we formulate a general approach towards approximating CSPs with
global constraints using SDP hierarchies. To demonstrate the approach we
present the following results:
  Using the Lasserre hierarchy, we present an algorithm that runs in time
$O(n^{poly(1/\epsilon)})$ that given an instance of \maxbisection with value
$1-\epsilon$, finds a bisection with value $1-O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$. This
approximation is near-optimal (up to constant factors in $O()$) under the
Unique Games Conjecture.
  By a computer-assisted proof, we show that the same algorithm also achieves a
0.85-approximation for \maxbisection, improving on the previous bound of 0.70
(note that it is \uniquegames hard to approximate better than a 0.878 factor).
The same algorithm also yields a 0.92-approximation for \maxtwosat with
cardinality constraints.
  For every CSP with a global cardinality constraints, we present a generic
conversion from integrality gap instances for the Lasserre hierarchy to a {\it
dictatorship test} whose soundness is at most integrality gap. Dictatorship
testing gadgets are central to hardness results for CSPs, and a generic
conversion of the above nature lies at the core of the tight Unique Games based
hardness result for CSPs. \cite{Raghavendra08}

refer to such an estimate as a (2,epsilon)-estimate. The query complexity and
running time of the algorithm are ~O(avg_deg * poly(1/epsilon)), where avg_deg
denotes the average vertex degree in the graph. The best previously known
sublinear algorithm, of Yoshida et al. (STOC 2009), has query complexity and
running time O(d^4/epsilon^2), where d is the maximum degree in the graph.

Theta(n^2), we consider another model, in which the algorithm may ask, for any

to adapt the algorithm that uses neighbor queries to this model and obtain an

representation of knowledge, information, or belief, two agents can assign
different states to the same quantum system. This raises two questions: when
are such state assignments compatible? and how should the state assignments of
different agents be reconciled? In this paper, we address these questions from
the perspective of the recently developed conditional states formalism for
quantum theory [arXiv:1107.5849]. Specifically, we derive a compatibility
criterion proposed by Brun, Finkelstein and Mermin from the requirement that,
upon acquiring data, agents should update their states using a quantum
generalization of Bayesian conditioning. We provide two alternative arguments
for this criterion, based on the objective and subjective Bayesian
interpretations of probability theory. We then apply the same methodology to
the problem of quantum state improvement, i.e. how to update your state when
you learn someone else's state assignment, and to quantum state pooling, i.e.
how to combine the state assignments of several agents into a single assignment
that accurately represents the views of the group. In particular, we derive a
pooling rule previously proposed by Spekkens and Wiseman under much weaker
assumptions than those made in the original derivation. All of our results
apply to a much broader class of experimental scenarios than have been

challenge for the photometric characterization of these systems. We present a
suite of simulations aimed at understanding how different observational choices
related to the properties of a low luminosity system impact our ability to
determine its true structural parameters such as half-light radius and central
surface brightness. We focus on estimating half-light radii (on which mass
estimates depend linearly) and find that these numbers can have up to 100%
uncertainties when relatively shallow photometric surveys, such as SDSS, are
used. Our simulations suggest that to recover structural parameters within 10%
or better of their true values: (a) the ratio of the field-of-view to the
half-light radius of the satellite must be greater than three, (b) the total
number of stars, including background objects should be larger than 1000, and
(c) the central to background stellar density ratio must be higher than 20. If
one or more of these criteria are not met, the accuracy of the resulting
structural parameters can be significantly compromised. In the context of
future surveys such as LSST, the latter condition will be closely tied to our
ability to remove unresolved background galaxies. Assessing the reliability of
measured structural parameters will become increasingly critical as the next

find that the radiation hydrodynamical/sink particle simulation reproduces many
observed stellar properties very well. In particular, whereas using a
barotropic equation of state produces more brown dwarfs than stars, the
inclusion of radiative feedback results in a stellar mass function and a ratio
of brown dwarfs to stars in good agreement with observations of Galactic

the stars and brown dwarfs are in reasonable agreement with observations,
including multiplicity as a function of primary mass, the frequency of
very-low-mass binaries, and general trends for the mass ratio and separation

interactions, and coplanarity of orbits and sink particle spins in multiple

of the cosmic rays in the shock region is key in making the mechanism

streaming ahead of the shock. For the efficiency of scattering of the highest

rotation period of CU Vir was gradually shortening until the year 1968, when it
reached its local minimum of 0.52067198 d. The period then started increasing,
reaching its local maximum of 0.5207163 d in the year 2005. Since that time the
rotation has begun to accelerate again. We also found much smaller period
changes in CU Vir on a timescale of several years. The rotation period of V901

crest and reattaches downstream on the bed (at x=5.7h). A favorable pressure
gradient accelerates the flow over the stoss-side (the upward-sloping region
for x > 8h) and an unfavorable gradient for x < 8h decelerates the flow over
the lee-side of the dune. Due to the separation of the flow, a shear layer is
generated after the crest that expands in the wake region towards the next
dune. The outer-layer turbulence structures are visualized through isosurfaces
of pressure fluctuations colored by distance to the surface. Spanwise vortices
are generated in the shear layer separating from the crest due to the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. They are convected downstream and either interact
with the wall or rise to the surface, taking the form of large horseshoe-like
structures. These structures may undergo an intense distortion, become
one-legged, or be completely destroyed. As they grow to dimensions comparable
to (or larger than) the flow depth, a strong ejection occurs between their
legs. The interaction between two large coherent structures may result in
merging, or in dissipation of the weaker one. Surviving eddies grow and rise
along the shear layer emanating from the dune crest; they tilt downward and,
eventually, their tips touch the surface. When the legs of the horseshoe are
close to the surface, they create an upwelling, which expands and weakens. The
legs of the vortex loop remain coherent for a longer time.

from a collimated relativistic jet, powered by the sudden onset of accretion
onto a supermassive black hole following the tidal disruption of a star. Here
we model the radio-microwave emission as synchrotron radiation produced by the
shock interaction between the jet and the gaseous circumnuclear medium (CNM).
At early times after the onset of the jet (t < 5-10 days) a reverse shock
propagates through and decelerates the ejecta, while at later times the outflow
approaches the Blandford-McKee self-similar evolution (possibly modified by
additional late energy injection). The achromatic break in the radio light
curve of J1644+57 is naturally explained as the transition between these
phases. We show that the temporal indices of the pre- and post-break light
curve are consistent with those predicted if the CNM has a wind-type radial
density profile n ~ 1/r^2. The observed synchrotron frequencies and
self-absorbed flux constrain the fraction of the post-shock thermal energy in
relativistic electrons epsilon_e ~ 0.03-0.1; the CNM density at 1e18 cm ~ 1-10
1/cm^3; and the initial Lorentz factor Gamma_j ~ 10-20 and opening angle
theta_j ~ (0.1-1)Gamma_j^(-1) ~ 0.01-0.1 of the jet. Radio modeling thus
provides robust independent evidence for a narrowly collimated outflow.
Extending our model to the future evolution of J1644+57, we predict that the
radio flux at low frequencies (<~ few GHz) will begin to brighten more rapidly
once the characteristic frequency crosses below the self-absorption frequency
on a timescale of months (indeed, such a transition may already have begun).
Our results demonstrate that relativistic outflows from tidal disruption events
provide a unique probe of the conditions in distant, previously inactive
galactic nuclei, complementing studies of normal AGN.

are perceived by users before issuing any clicks, the relevance induced by
clicks are usually called \emph{perceived relevance} which has proven to be
quite useful for Web search. While there is plenty of click data for popular

  Typos fixed",,,,"math.RA math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a graded version of the theory of cyclotomic q-Schur algebras, in
the spirit of the work of Brundan-Kleshchev on Hecke algebras and of Ariki on
q-Schur algebras. As an application, we identify the coefficients of the
canonical basis on a higher level Fock space with q-analogues of the
decomposition numbers of cyclotomic q-Schur algebras.
  We present cyclotomic q-Schur algebras as a quotient of a convolution algebra
arising in the geometry of quivers; hence we call these quiver Schur algebras.
These algebras are also presented diagrammatically, similar in flavor to a
recent construction of Khovanov and Lauda. They are also manifestly graded and
so equip the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra with a non-obvious grading.
  On the way we construct a graded cellular basis of this algebra, resembling
the constructions for cyclotomic Hecke algebras by Mathas, Hu, Brundan and the
first author.
  The quiver Schur algebra is also interesting from the perspective of higher
representation theory. The sum of Grothendieck groups of certain cyclotomic
quotients is known to agree with a higher level Fock space. We show that our
graded version defines a higher q-Fock space (defined as a tensor product of
level 1 q-deformed Fock spaces). Under this identification, the indecomposable
projective modules are identified with the canonical basis and the Weyl modules
with the standard basis. This allows us to prove the already described relation
between decomposition numbers and canonical bases.

one derivative more singular than the active scalar. In the presence of
supercritical fractional diffusion given by (-\Delta)^\gamma, where 0<\gamma<1,
we discover that for \gamma>1/2 the equations are locally well-posed, while for
\gamma<1/2 they are ill-posed, in the sense that there is no Lipschitz solution
map. The main reason for the striking loss of regularity when \gamma goes below
1/2 is that the constitutive law used to obtain the velocity from the active
scalar is given by an unbounded Fourier multiplier which is both even and
anisotropic. Lastly, we note that the anisotropy of the constitutive law for
the velocity may be explored in order to obtain an improvement in the
regularity of the solutions when the initial data and the force have thin
Fourier support, i.e. they are supported on a plane in frequency space. In
particular, for such well-prepared data one may prove the local existence and
uniqueness of solutions for all values of \gamma \in (0,1).

properties of the inter-stellar medium that regulate galactic-scale star
formation activity. We present here the results of a suite of star formation
models applied to the nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies NGC 2915 and NGC 1705.
Each of these galaxies has a stellar disk embedded in a much larger,
essentially star-less HI disk. These atypical stellar morphologies allow for
rigorous tests of star formation models that examine the effects on star
formation of the HI, stellar and dark matter mass components, as well as the
kinematics of the gaseous and stellar disks. We use far ultra-violet and 24
micron imaging from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Spitzer Infrared
Nearby Galaxies Survey respectively to map the spatial distribution of the
total star formation rate surface density within each galaxy. New
high-resolution HI line observations obtained with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array are used to study the distribution and dynamics of each galaxy's
neutral inter-stellar medium. The standard Toomre Q parameter is unable to
distinguish between active and non-active star forming regions, predicting the
HI disks of the dwarfs to be sub-critical. Two-fluid instability models
incorporating the stellar and dark matter components of each galaxy, in
addition to the gaseous component, yield portions of the inner disk unstable.
Finally, a formalisation in which the HI kinematics are characterised by the
rotational shear of the gas produces models that very accurately match the
observations. This suggests the time available for perturbations to collapse in
the presence of rotational shear to be an important factor governing
galactic-scale star formation.

consisting of red-giant and magnetized neutron star (NS) are discussed. The
spin-up/spin-down torques applied to NS are derived based on a hydrodynamic
theory of quasi-spherical accretion onto magnetized NSs. In this model, a
settling subsonic accretion proceeds through a hot shell formed around the NS
magnetosphere. The accretion rate onto the NS is determined by the ability of
the plasma to enter the magnetosphere.Due to large Reynolds numbers in the
shell, the interaction of the rotating magnetosphere with plasma initiates a
subsonic turbulence. The convective motions are capable of carrying the angular
momentum through the shell. We carry out a population synthesis of SyXBs in the
Galaxy with account for the spin evolution of magnetized NS. The Galactic
number of SyXBs with bright (M_v<1) low-mass red-giant companion is found to be
from \sim 40 to 120, and their birthrate is \sim 5\times 10^{-5}-10^{-4} per
year. According to our model, among known SyXBs, Sct X-1 and IRXS
J180431.1-273932 are wind-fed accretors. GX 1+4 lies in the transition from the
wind-fed SyXBs to SyXBs in which the giants overflow their Roche lobe. The
model successfully reproduces very long NS spins (such as in IGR J16358-4724
and 4U 1954+31) without the need to invoke very strong magnetic fields.

emission and absorption of a single particle to be separated by a space-like
interval without violating Lorentz symmetries and causality. Although the
answer is indeed affirmative, traditionally such effects have been considered
negligible. We show that for sufficiently light mass eigenstates such processes
can become significant over macroscopic length scales. A critical review of the
historical literature reveals various shortcomings of the standard methods;
specifically, one finds that they are restricted to states for which the
expectation value of momentum vanishes. Furthermore, the results obtained here
correct Feynman's analysis of this subject. A formalism is thus developed that
allows the description of states with non-zero momentum, which is then applied
to the OPERA and ICARUS neutrino-speed experiments. For OPERA we choose a mass
in the nano electron-volt range and find that although our formalism predicts a
non-zero detection probability for an early arrival time of 60 ns, the
predicted event distribution is maximal on the light-cone. Consequently, our
prediction does not reproduce the peak at 60 ns reported by the OPERA
collaboration. Turning to the ICARUS experiment, we note that while the
collaboration reported an average time of flight that is consistent with the
speed of light, the event data with its associated uncertainties nevertheless
indicates that some of the detection events are separated from their
corresponding emission events by a space-like interval. For a micro
electron-volt mass range, this is in agreement with the here reported
formalism. We thus raise the possibility of employing high-precision
neutrino-speed experiments to determine the absolute masses of neutrino mass
eigenstates.

diffusion of the 'hot' nonequilibrium quasiparticles (induced by the
oscillations of $|\Delta|$ in the center of the microbridge) to the leads. The
effect is absent in short microbridges (with length less than the coherence
length) and it is relatively weak in long microbridges (with length larger than
the inelastic relaxation length of the nonequilibrium distribution function). A
nonmonotonous dependence of $I_r$ on the length of the microbridge is
predicted. Our results are important for the explanation of the enhancement of
the critical current and the appearance of negative magnetoresistance observed

currently reachable with PIONIER. Methods. Our method is based on the closure
phase, which is the most robust interferometric quantity when searching for
faint companions. We computed the chi^2 goodness of fit for a series of binary
star models at different positions and with various flux ratios. The resulting
chi^2 cube was used to identify the best-fit binary model and evaluate its
significance, or to determine upper limits on the companion flux in case of non
detections. Results. No companion is found around Fomalhaut, tau Cet and
Regulus. The median upper limits at 3 sigma on the companion flux ratio are

previously detected near-infrared excess emissions around Fomalhaut and tau Cet
are not related to a low-mass companion, and instead come from an extended
source such as an exozodiacal disk. In the case of del Aqr, in 30 min of
observation, we obtain the first direct detection of a previously known
companion, at an angular distance of about 40 mas and with a flux ratio of
2.05e-2 \pm 0.16e-2. Due to the limited u,v plane coverage, its position can,
however, not be unambiguously determined. Conclusions. After only a few months
of operation, PIONIER has already achieved one of the best dynamic ranges
world-wide for multi-aperture interferometers. A dynamic range up to about
1:500 is demonstrated, but significant improvements are still required to reach
the ultimate goal of directly detecting hot giant extrasolar planets.

which is of course impossible in practice, we show that the energy could be
inferred with a negligible bias and 12% resolution. However, we show that a
mixed calibration could also be performed, including both type of primaries,

plausibly explained as the result of perturbing structures superposed on the
underlying smooth matter distribution of the primary lens. The cold dark matter
cosmological model predicts that a large number of substructures should survive
inside larger halos but, surprisingly, this population alone has been shown to
be insufficient to explain the observed distribution of the flux ratios of
quasar's multiple images. Other halos (and their own subhalos) projected along
the line of sight to the primary lens have been considered as additional source
of perturbation. In this work, we use ray tracing through the Millennium II
simulation to investigate the importance of projection effects due to halos and
subhalos of mass m>1E8 Msun/h and extend our analysis to lower masses, m>1E6
Msun/h, using Monte-Carlo halo distributions. We find that the magnitude of the
violation depends strongly on the density profile and concentration of the
intervening halos, but clustering plays only a minor role. For a typical
lensing geometry (lens at redshift 0.6 and source at redshift 2), background
haloes (behind the main lens) are more likely to cause a violation than
foreground halos. We conclude that line-of-sight structures can be as important
as intrinsic substructures in causing flux-ratio anomalies. The combined effect
of perturbing structures within the lens and along the line of sight in the
LCDM universe results in a cusp-violation probability of 20-30%. This
alleviates the discrepancy between models and current data, but a larger
observational sample is required for a stronger test of the theory.

derived only at a distance epsilon^{1+tau} (for some tau>0) away from the
fibres. This distance constraint is rather sharp since the gradients of the
solutions are shown to be unbounded locally in L^p as soon as p>2. One key
ingredient is the derivation in dimension two of regularity estimates to the
solutions of the equations deduced from a Fourier series expansion with respect
to the fibres direction, and weighted by the high-contrast conductivity. The
dependence on powers of epsilon of these two-dimensional estimates is shown to
be sharp. The initial motivation for this work comes from imaging, and enhanced
resolution phenomena observed experimentally in the presence of
micro-structures. We use these regularity estimates to characterize the
signature of low volume fraction heterogeneities in the fibred reinforced
medium assuming that the heterogeneities stay at a distance epsilon^{1+tau}

whole encoding process takes O(n) time and space, where $n$ is the binary size

of real-world contact networks in which a single underlying static graph does
not exist. The average eigenspace may be used to construct a graph which
represents the `average spanning tree' of the network or a representation of
the most common propagation paths. We then examine the distribution of
deviations from the average and find that this distribution in real-world
contact networks is multi-modal; thus indicating several \emph{modes} in the
underlying network. These modes are identified and are found to correspond to
particular times. Thus JD may be used to decompose the behaviour, in time, of
contact networks and produce average static graphs for each time. This may be
viewed as a mixture between a dynamic and static graph approach to contact
network analysis.

Under some simplifying assumptions these systems can be modeled by thin Ising

these films. On the one hand we discuss the microcanonical density of states
and its prominent features. On the other we analyze canonically various global
and layer quantities. We obtain the phase diagram of thin Ising metamagnets as
a function of temperature and external magnetic field. Whereas the phase
diagram of the bulk system only exhibits one phase transition between the
antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, the phase diagram of thin Ising
metamagnets includes an additional intermediate phase where one of the surface
layers has aligned itself with the direction of the applied magnetic field.
This additional phase transition is discontinuous and ends in a critical end
point. Consequently, it is possible to gradually go from the antiferromagnetic
phase to the intermediate phase without passing through a phase transition.

methods often render optimum performance only under limited and restricted
conditions. Such methods utilize several training samples so as to achieve high
accuracy. Moreover, several constraints are imposed on the end-user so that the
system may work optimally, and as expected. For example, the user is made to
sign within a small box, in order to limit their signature to a predefined set
of dimensions, thus eliminating scaling. Moreover, the angular rotation with
respect to the referenced signature that will be inadvertently introduced as
human error, hampers performance of biometric signature verification systems.
To eliminate this, traditionally, a user is asked to sign exactly on top of a
reference line. In this paper, we propose a robust system that optimizes the
signature obtained from the user for a large range of variation in
Rotation-Scaling-Translation (RST) and resolves these error parameters in the
user signature according to the reference signature stored in the database.

waves at the origin of the bifurcation cascade possess a shift-reflect symmetry
and are both axially and azimuthally periodic with wave numbers {\kappa} = 1.63

transitions result in a wide range of time dependent solutions that includes
spiralling, modulated-travelling, modulated-spiralling,
doubly-modulated-spiralling and mildly chaotic waves. We show that the latter
spring from heteroclinic tangles of the stable and unstable invariant manifolds
of two shift-reflect-symmetric modulated-travelling waves. The chaotic set thus
produced is confined to a limited range of Reynolds numbers, bounded by the
occurrence of manifold tangencies. The states studied here belong to a subspace
of discrete symmetry which makes many of the bifurcation and path-following

the phenomenology carries over to the full state-space, thus suggesting a
mechanism for the formation and break-up of invariant states that can sustain

behavior; in particular, their dynamics is highly nonlinear. Here, we review
several types of nonlinear behavior in resonators made from nanotubes and
graphene. We first discuss an unprecedented scenario where damping is described
by a nonlinear force. This scenario is supported by several experimental facts:
(i) the quality factor varies with the amplitude of the motion as a power law
whose exponent coincides with the value predicted by the nonlinear damping
model, (ii) hysteretic behavior (of the motional amplitude as a function of
driving frequency) is absent in some of our resonators even for large driving
forces, as expected when nonlinear damping forces are large, and (iii) when we
quantify the linear damping force (by performing parametric excitation
measurements) we find that it is significantly smaller than the nonlinear
damping force. We then review parametric excitation measurements, an
alternative actuation method which is based on nonlinear dynamics. Finally, we
discuss experiments where the mechanical motion is coupled to electron
transport through a nanotube. The coupling can be made so strong that the
associated force acting on the nanotube becomes highly nonlinear with
displacement and velocity. Overall, graphene and nanotube resonators hold
promise for future studies on classical and quantum nonlinear dynamics.

to quite general random matrix models, by replacing the matrices with operators
satisfying certain freeness relations. We comment on the relation between our
free deterministic equivalent and deterministic equivalents considered in the
engineering literature. We do not only consider the case of square matrices,
but also show how rectangular matrices can be treated. Furthermore, we
emphasize how operator-valued free probability techniques can be used to solve
our free deterministic equivalents.
  As an illustration of our methods we consider a random matrix model studied
first by R. Couillet, J. Hoydis, and M. Debbah. We show how its free
deterministic equivalent can be treated and we thus recover in a conceptual way
their result.
  On a technical level, we generalize a result from scalar valued free
probability, by showing that randomly rotated deterministic matrices of
different sizes are asymptotically free from deterministic rectangular
matrices, with amalgamation over a certain algebra of projections.
  In the Appendix, we show how estimates for differences between Cauchy

the real axis. This is of some relevance if one wants to compare the original

in a $d$-dimensional film geometry at their bulk critical points. A detailed
renormalization-group (RG) study of the critical Casimir forces induced between
the film's boundary planes by thermal fluctuations is presented for the case
where the O(n) symmetry remains unbroken by the surfaces. The boundary planes
are assumed to cause short-ranged disturbances of the interactions that can be
modelled by standard surface contributions $\propto \bm{\phi}^2$ corresponding
to subcritical or critical enhancement of the surface interactions. This
translates into mesoscopic boundary conditions of the generic
symmetry-preserving Robin type $\partial_n\bm{\phi}=\mathring{c}_j\bm{\phi}$.
RG-improved perturbation theory and Abel-Plana techniques are used to compute
the $L$-dependent part $f_{\mathrm{res}}$ of the reduced excess free energy per
film area $A\to\infty $ to two-loop order. When $d<4$, it takes the scaling
form $f_{\mathrm{res}}\approx D(c_1L^{\Phi/\nu},c_2L^{\Phi/\nu})/L^{d-1}$ as
$L\to\infty$, where $c_i$ are scaling fields associated with the
surface-enhancement variables $\mathring{c}_i$, while $\Phi$ is a standard
surface crossover exponent. The scaling function $D(\mathsf{c}_1,\mathsf{c}_2)$
and its analogue $\mathcal{D}(\mathsf{c}_1,\mathsf{c}_2)$ for the Casimir force
are determined via expansion in $\epsilon=4-d$ and extrapolated to $d=3$
dimensions. In the special case $\mathsf{c}_1=\mathsf{c}_2=0$, the expansion
becomes fractional. Consistency with the known fractional expansions of D(0,0)
and $\mathcal{D}(0,0)$ to order $\epsilon^{3/2}$ is achieved by appropriate
reorganisation of RG-improved perturbation theory. For appropriate choices of
$c_1$ and $c_2$, the Casimir forces can have either sign. Furthermore,
crossovers from attraction to repulsion and vice versa may occur as $L$
increases.

  Therefore, we analyzed data from an archival XMM-Newton observation, pointed
towards HESS J1626-490, to classify detected point-like and extended X-ray
sources according to their spectral properties. None of the detected X-ray
point sources fulfills the energetic requirements to be considered as the
synchrotron radiation (SR) counterpart to the VHE source assuming an Inverse

X-ray excess emission originating from the region around HESS J1626-490 above
the Galactic Background. The derived upper limit for the total X-ray flux
disfavors a purely leptonic emission scenario for HESS J1626-490.
  To characterize the Interstellar Medium surrounding HESS J1626-490 we
analyzed ^{12}CO(J=1-0) molecular line data from the Nanten Galactic plane
survey and HI data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS). We found a
good morphological match between molecular and atomic gas in the -27 km/s to
-18 km/s line-of-sight velocity range and HESS J1626-490. The cloud has a mass
of 1.8x10^4 M_sun and is located at a mean kinematic distance of d = 1.8 kpc.
Furthermore, we found a density depression in the HI gas at a similar distance
which is spatially consistent with the SNR G335.2+00.1.
  Therefore, the most likely origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission observed with
H.E.S.S. is the hadronic interaction of cosmic rays with a moderately dense
molecular cloud, which we detected with Nanten. The application of a detailed
hadronic model for cosmic ray transport and interaction shows that the cosmic
rays could originate from the nearby SNR G335.2+00.1.

quality of the paramagnetic solution at high temperatures, a better estimate
(lower) for the critical temperature, and the fact that the GBP message passing
algorithm converges also to non paramagnetic solutions. The lack of convergence
of the standard GBP message passing algorithm at low temperatures seems to be
related to the implementation details and not to the appearance of long range
order. In fact, we prove that a gauge invariance of the constrained CVM free
energy can be exploited to derive a new message passing algorithm which

Herschel observations of the LMC, in order to: (i) systematically study the
uncertainties and biases affecting dust mass estimates; and to (ii) explore the
peculiar ISM properties of the LMC.
  Methods: To achieve these goals, we have modelled the spatially resolved SEDs
with two alternate grain compositions, to study the impact of different
submillimetre opacities on the dust mass. We have rigorously propagated the
observational errors (noise and calibration) through the entire fitting
process, in order to derive consistent parameter uncertainties.
  Results: First, we show that using the integrated SED leads to
underestimating the dust mass by ~50 % compared to the value obtained with
sufficient spatial resolution, for the region we studied. This might be the
case, in general, for unresolved galaxies. Second, we show that Milky Way type
grains produce higher gas-to-dust mass ratios than what seems possible
according to the element abundances in the LMC. A spatial analysis shows that
this dilemma is the result of an exceptional property: the grains of the LMC
have on average a larger intrinsic submm opacity (emissivity index beta~1.7 and
opacity kappa_abs(160 microns)=1.6 m2/kg) than those of the Galaxy. By studying
the spatial distribution of the gas-to-dust mass ratio, we are able to
constrain the fraction of unseen gas mass between ~10, and ~100 % and show that
it is not sufficient to explain the gas-to-dust mass ratio obtained with Milky
Way type grains. Finally, we confirm the detection of a 500 microns extended
emission excess with an average relative amplitude of ~15 %, varying up to 40
%. This excess anticorrelates well with the dust mass surface density. Although
we do not know the origin of this excess, we show that it is unlikely the
result of very cold dust, or CMB fluctuations.

nondeterministic automata (2NFAs) by two-way deterministic automata (2DFAs) was
raised in 1978 and, despite many attempts, it is still open. Subsequently, the
problem was attacked by restricting the power of 2DFAs (e.g., using a
restricted input head movement) to the degree for which it was already possible
to derive some exponential gaps between the weaker model and the standard
2NFAs. Here we use an opposite approach, increasing the power of 2DFAs to the
degree for which it is still possible to obtain a subexponential conversion
from the stronger model to the standard 2DFAs. In particular, it turns out that
subexponential conversion is possible for two-way automata that make
nondeterministic choices only when the input head scans one of the input tape
endmarkers. However, there is no restriction on the input head movement. This
implies that an exponential gap between 2NFAs and 2DFAs can be obtained only
for unrestricted 2NFAs using capabilities beyond the proposed new model. As an
additional bonus, conversion into a machine for the complement of the original
language is polynomial in this model. The same holds for making such machines
self-verifying, halting, or unambiguous. Finally, any superpolynomial lower
bound for the simulation of such machines by standard 2DFAs would imply L<>NL.
In the same way, the alternating version of these machines is related to L =?
NL =? P, the classical computational complexity problems.

flares in the Sco X-1 like group, and the nature of this branch was not clear.
However, based on observations of Cygnus X-2 in which this dipping/flaring
occurred it was proposed that the mass accretion rate in Z-track sources in
general increases monotonically along the Z-track towards the Flaring Branch, a
standard assumption widely held. It was also suggested that the Cygnus X-2
group have high inclination. Based on recent multi-wavelength observations of
Cygnus X-2 we resolve these issues, showing by spectral analysis that the
Dipping Branch consists of absorption events in the outer disk, unrelated to
the occasional real flaring in the source. Thus motivation for Mdot increasing
along the Z from Horizontal - Normal to Flaring Branch is removed, as is the
idea that high inclination distinguishes the Cygnus X-2 group. Finally, the
observations provide further evidence for the extended nature of the Accretion
Disk Corona (ADC), and the correct modelling of the ADC Comptonized emission is
crucial to the interpretation of low mass X-ray binary data.

the Hyades in an analytic Milky Way potential that account for stellar
evolution and include primordial binaries in a few models. Furthermore, we
applied a Kroupa (2001) IMF and used extensive ensemble-averaging. Results: We
find that evolved single-star King initial models with King parameters $W_0 =
6-9$ and initial particle numbers $N_0 = 3000$ provide good fits to the
observational present-day cumulative mass profile within the Jacobi radius. The
best-fit King model has an initial mass of $1721\ M_\odot$ and an average mass
loss rate of $-2.2 \ M_\odot/\mathrm{Myr}$. The K-band LFs of models and
observations show a reasonable agreement. Mass segregation is detected in both
observations and models. If 33% primordial binaries are included the initial
particle number is reduced by 5% as compared to the model without primordial
binaries. Conclusions: The present-day properties of the Hyades can be well
reproduced by a standard King or Plummer initial model when choosing
appropriate initial conditions. The degeneracy of good-fitting models can be
quite high due to the large dimension of the parameter space. More simulations
with different Roche-lobe filling factors and primordial binary fractions are

reviewed specifically with regard to the nature of the three distinct states of
the sources. A physical model is presented for the Cygnus X-2 sub-group in
which increasing mass accretion rate takes place on the Normal Branch resulting
in high neutron star temperature and radiation pressure responsible for inner
disk disruption and launching of jets. The Flaring Branch consists of unstable
nuclear burning on the neutron star. It is shown that the Sco X-1 like
sub-group is dominated by almost non-stop flaring consisting of both unstable
burning and increase of Mdot, causing higher neutron star temperatures.
Finally, results of Atoll source surveys are presented and a model for the
nature of the Banana and Island states in these sources is proposed. Motion
along the Banana state is caused by variation of Mdot. Measurements of the high
energy cut-off of the Comptonized emission E_CO provide the electron
temperature T_e of the Comptonizing ADC; above a luminosity of 2x10^37 erg/s
E_CO is a few keV and T_e equals the neutron star temperature. At lower
luminosities, the cut-off energy rises towards 100 keV showing heating of the
corona by an unknown process. This spectral hardening is the cause of the

particles' orbits are chaotic and unstable. Wisdom (1980) showed that the chaos
is driven by the overlap of mean motion resonances which occurs within a
distance (da/a)_chaos = 1.3 mu^2/7 of the planet's orbit. However, the width of
mean motion resonances grows with the particles' eccentricity, which will
increase the width of the chaotic zone at higher eccentricities. Here we
investigate the width of the chaotic zone using the iterated encounter map and
N-body integrations. We find that the classical prescription works well for
particles on low-eccentricity orbits. However, above a critical eccentricity,
dependent upon the mass of the planet, the width of the chaotic zone increases
with eccentricity. An extension of Wisdom's analytical arguments then shows
that, above the critical eccentricity, the chaotic zone width is given by
(da/a)_chaos = 1.8 e^1/5 mu^1/5, which agrees well with the encounter map
results. The critical eccentricity is given by e_cr = 0.21 mu^3/7. This
extended chaotic zone results in a larger cleared region when a planet sculpts
the inner edge of a debris disc comprised of eccentric planetesimals. Hence,
the planet mass estimated from the classical chaotic zone may be erroneous. We
apply this result to the HR8799 system, showing that the masses of HR8799b
inferred from the truncation of the disc may vary by up to 50% depending on the
disc particles' eccentricities. With a disc edge at 90AU, the necessary mass of
planet b to cause the truncation would be 8-10 Jovian masses if the disc
particles have low eccentricities (<0.02), but only 4-8 Jovian masses if the
disc particles have higher eccentricities. Our result also has implications for
the ability of a planet to feed material into an inner system, a process which
may explain metal pollution in White Dwarf atmospheres.

companions, we investigate the observational properties of the spiral-onion
shell wakes due to the gravitational interaction of these companions with the
outflowing circumstellar matter. Three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
at high resolution show that the substellar mass objects produce detectable
signatures at 100 AU distance, for the wake induced by a Jupiter to brown dwarf
mass object orbiting a solar mass AGB star. In particular, the arm pattern
propagates with a speed depending on the local wind and sound speeds, implying
possible variations in the arm separation in the wind acceleration region
and/or in a slow wind with significant temperature variation. The pattern
propagation speeds of the inner and outer boundaries differ by twice the sound
speed, leading to the overlap of high density boundaries in slow winds and
producing a subpattern of the spiral arm feature. Vertically, the wake forms
concentric arcs with angular sizes anticorrelated to the wind Mach number. We
provide an empirical formula for the peak density enhancement as a function of
the mass, orbital distance, and velocity of the object as well as the wind and
local sound speeds. In typical condition of AGB envelopes, the arm-interarm
density contrast can be greater than 30 % of the background density within a
distance of ~10(M_p/M_J) AU for the object mass M_p in units of Jupiter mass
M_J. These results suggest that such features may probe unseen substellar mass
objects embedded in the winds of AGB stars and may be useful in planning future

maps of Ap stars obtained by Zeeman Doppler mapping (ZDM). It is shown how they
can be adversely affected by the assumption of a mean stellar atmosphere
instead of appropriate ""local"" atmospheres corresponding to the actual
abundances in a given region. The essenceof the difficulties was already shown
by Chandrasekhar's picket-fence model. The results obtained with a suite of
Stokes codes written in the Ada programming language and based on modern
line-blanketed atmospheres are described in detail. We demonstrate that the
high metallicity values claimed to have been found in chemically inhomogeneous
Ap star atmospheres would lead to local temperature structures, continuum and
line intensities, and line shapes that differ significantly from those
predicted by a mean stellar atmosphere. Unfortunately, past applications of ZDM
have consistently overlooked the intricate aspects of metallicity with their
all-pervading effects. The erroneous assumption of a mean atmosphere for a
spotted star can lead to phase-dependent errors of uncomfortably large
proportions at varying wavelengths both in the Stokes I and V profiles, making
precise mapping of abundances and magnetic field vectors largely impossible.
The relation between core and wings of the H_beta line changes, too, with
possible repercussions on the determination of gravity and effective
temperature. Finally, a ZDM analysis of the synthetic Stokes spectra of a
spotted star reveals the disturbing differences between the respective
abundance maps based on a mean atmosphere on the one hand, and on appropriate
""local"" atmospheres on the other. We then discuss what this all means for
published ZDMresults. Our discussion makes it clear that realistic local
atmospheres must be used, especially if credible small-scale structures are to
be obtained.

dipole that can be reversed by application of an external electric field, a
feature that is exploited in ferroelectric memories. All ferroelectrics are
piezoelectric, and therefore exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling between
polarization and elastic deformation - a feature widely used in piezoelectric
transducers and high-displacement actuators. A less explored and exploited
property is flexoelectricity, i.e. the coupling between polarization and a
strain gradient. Though flexoelectricity is an old concept (it was discovered
in the Soviet Union almost 50 years ago), it is only with the advent of
nanotechnology that its full potential is beginning to be realized, as
gradients at the nanoscale can be much larger than at the macroscopic scale.
Here, we demonstrate that the stress gradient generated by the tip of an atomic
force microscope can be used to mechanically switch the polarization in the
nanoscale volume of a ferroelectric film. This observation shows that pure
mechanical force can be used as a dynamic tool for polarization control,
enabling information processing in a new type of multiferroic high-density data
storage devices where the memory bits are written mechanically and read
electrically.

  based on a Carbon Border Tax and Emissions Trading","Accepted for publication in Energy Policy (Elsevier)","Energy Policy, vol 57, pp. 363-380, 2013","10.1016/j.enpol.2013.02.012",,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It will be difficult to gain the agreement of all the actors on any proposal
for climate change management, if universality and fairness are not considered.
In this work, a universal measure of emissions to be applied at the
international level is proposed, based on a modification of the Greenhouse Gas
Intensity (GHG-INT) measure. It is hoped that the generality and low
administrative cost of this measure, which we call the Modified Greenhouse Gas
Intensity measure (MGHG-INT), will eliminate any need to classify nations. The
core of the MGHG-INT is what we call the IHDI-adjusted Gross Domestic Product
(IDHIGDP), based on the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). The
IDHIGDP makes it possible to propose universal measures, such as MGHG-INT. We
also propose a carbon border tax applicable at national borders, based on
MGHG-INT and IDHIGDP. This carbon tax is supported by a proposed global
Emissions Trading System (ETS). The proposed carbon tax is analyzed in a
short-term scenario, where it is shown that it can result in significant
reduction in global emissions while keeping the economy growing at a positive
rate. In addition to annual GHG emissions, cumulative GHG emissions over two
decades are considered with almost the same results.

nanomembranes for cavity quantum optomechanics experiments. GaAs nanomembranes
with an area of 1.36 mm by 1.91 mm and a thickness of 160 nm are obtained by
using a two-step selective wet-etching technique. The frequency noise spectrum
reveals several mechanical modes in the kilohertz regime with mechanical
Q-factors up to 2,300,000 at room temperature. The measured mechanical mode
profiles agree well with a taut rectangular drumhead model. Our results show
that GaAs nanomembranes provide a promising path towards quantum optical
control of massive nanomechanical systems.
