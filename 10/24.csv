stochastic differential equations driven by pure jump L\'evy process (FBSDEL in

a forward backward stochastic differential equations driven by a Brownian
motion and Poisson process (FBSDEBP in short), in which we replace the small
jumps by a Brownian motion. Then, we prove the convergence of the approximation
when the size of small jumps $\eps$ goes to 0. In the second step, we obtain
the $L^p$ H\""older continuity of the solution of FBSDEBP and we construct two
numerical schemes for this FBSDEBP. Based on the $L^p$ H\""older estimate, we
prove the convergence of the scheme when the number of time steps $n$ goes to
infinity. Combining these two steps leads to prove the convergence of numerical
schemes to the solution of FBSDEL.

framework, known as holographic gauge mediation, the visible-sector gauge group
is realized in the gravitational description by probe D-branes and the
non-supersymmetric state by normalizable perturbations to the geometry. Using
the formalism of general gauge mediation, supersymmetry-breaking soft terms in
the visible sector can be related to the two-point functions of the

group. Such correlation functions cannot be directly calculated in the strongly
coupled field theory but can be determined using the gauge-gravity

considering a toy geometry where such two-point functions can be explicitly
calculated. Unlike previous implementations of holographic gauge mediation

the simplicity of the geometry considered) the visible sector gauginos remain

experimentally by measuring the expectation value of a small set of observables

extend the measure to 2 x d systems, providing its explicit form in terms of
observables and applying it to the relevant class of multiqubit states employed

properly accounts for jet features that so far have not been successfully

simultaneously fit the radio, X-ray and optical data of GRB 990510. We not only
find noticeable differences between our findings for the explosion and

fit when we include the observer angle in the data fit. The fit method will be

spatial proximity tend to co-evolve, yet attempts to invert the evolutionary
record to identify these constraints and use them to computationally fold
proteins have so far been unsuccessful. Here, we show that co-variation of
residue pairs, observed in a large protein family, provides sufficient
information to determine 3D protein structure. Using a data-constrained maximum
entropy model of the multiple sequence alignment, we identify pairs of
statistically coupled residue positions which are expected to be close in the
protein fold, termed contacts inferred from evolutionary information (EICs). To
assess the amount of information about the protein fold contained in these
coupled pairs, we evaluate the accuracy of predicted 3D structures for proteins
of 50-260 residues, from 15 diverse protein families, including a G-protein
coupled receptor. These structure predictions are de novo, i.e., they do not
use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The
resulting low C{\alpha}-RMSD error range of 2.7-5.1{\AA}, over at least 75% of
the protein, indicates the potential for predicting essentially correct 3D
structures for the thousands of protein families that have no known structure,
provided they include a sufficiently large number of divergent sample
sequences. With the current enormous growth in sequence information based on
new sequencing technology, this opens the door to a comprehensive survey of

is a characterization of the feasibility of interference alignment in the
symmetric case where all transmitters have M antennas and all receivers have N
antennas. If N >= M and all users desire d transmit dimensions, then alignment
is feasible if and only if (2r+1)d <= max(rN,(r+1)M) for all nonnegative
integers r. The analogous result holds with M and N switched if M >= N.
  It turns out that, just as for the 3-user parallel interference channel
\cite{BT09}, the length of alignment paths captures the essence of the problem.
In fact, for each feasible value of M and N the maximum alignment path length
dictates both the converse and achievability arguments.
  One of the implications of our feasibility criterion is that simply counting
equations and comparing to the number of variables does not predict
feasibility. Instead, a more careful investigation of the geometry of the
alignment problem is required. The necessary condition obtained by counting
equations is implied by our new feasibility criterion.

function of projected angular distance across the extent of the feature, and
compare these measurements against several theoretical models proposed for
sharp rotations of electric vector position angle in polarized SiO maser
emission. We find that the rotation is most likely caused by the angle \theta
between the line of sight and a projected magnetic field crossing the critical
Van Vleck angle for maser propagation. The fractional linear polarization
profile m_l(\theta) is well-fit by standard models for polarized maser
transport, but we find less agreement for the fractional circular polarization

  In particular, almost sure uniqueness, up to a global phase, is proved for
complex-valued objects under general two-point conditions. Under a tight sector
constraint absolute uniqueness is proved to hold with probability exponentially
close to unity as the object sparsity increases. Under a magnitude constraint
with random amplitude illumination, uniqueness modulo global phase is proved to
hold with probability exponentially close to unity as object sparsity
increases. For general complex-valued objects without any constraint, almost

probabilistic version of network calculus, which strives to retain the
simplicity of envelope approach from network calculus and use the arguments of
statistical multiplexing to determine probabilistic performance bounds in a

efficiency of modelling stochastic properties of the arrival traffic and the
service available to the traffic at a network node. The notion of effective
bandwidth from large deviations theory is a well known statistical descriptor

time varying resource availability to the arrival traffic at a network node.
The main contribution of this paper is to establish an end-to-end stochastic

which provides efficient end-to-end delay and backlog bounds that grows
linearly in the number of nodes ($H$) traversed by the arrival traffic, under

provide correlated outputs. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can

any classifier.
  We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models (FE-CCM), that
jointly optimizes all the sub-tasks, while requiring only a `black-box'
interface to the original classifier for each sub-task. We use a two-layer
cascade of classifiers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones,
with the output of the first layer fed into the second layer as input. Our
training method involves a feedback step that allows later classifiers to

With the former, the number of independent coupling constants is significantly
reduced. With the latter and by extending the original foliation-preserving
diffeomorphism symmetry $ {{Diff}}(M, {\cal{F}})$ to include a local U(1)
symmetry, the spin-0 gravitons are eliminated. Thus, all the problems related
to them disappear, including the instability, strong coupling, and different
speeds in the gravitational sector. When the theory couples to a scalar field,
we find that the scalar field is not only stable in both the ultraviolet (UV)

presence of high-order spatial derivative terms of the scalar field.
Furthermore, applying the theory to cosmology, we find that due to the
additional U(1) symmetry, the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe is
necessarily flat. We also investigate the scalar, vector, and tensor
perturbations of the flat FRW universe, and derive the general linearized field

in its birth cluster with the aid of numerical simulations. This work is a
continuation of an earlier study (Brasser et al., 2006) with several
substantial modifications. First, the system consisting of stars, planets and
comets is treated self-consistently in our N-body simulations, rather than
approximating the stellar encounters with the outer Solar System as hyperbolic
fly-bys. Second, we have included the expulsion of the cluster gas, a feature
that was absent previously. Third, we have used several models for the initial
conditions and density profile of the cluster -- either a Hernquist or Plummer
potential -- and chose other parameters based on the latest observations of
embedded clusters from the literature. {These other parameters result in the
stars being on radial orbits and the cluster collapses.} Similar to previous
studies, in our simulations the inner Oort cloud is formed from comets being
scattered by Jupiter and Saturn and having their pericentres decoupled from the
planets by perturbations from the cluster gas and other stars. We find that all
inner Oort clouds formed in these clusters have an inner edge ranging from 100
AU to a few hundred AU, and an outer edge at over 100\,000 AU, with little
variation in these values for all clusters. All inner Oort clouds formed are
consistent with the existence of (90377) Sedna, an inner Oort cloud dwarf
planetoid, at the inner edge of the cloud: Sedna tends to be at the innermost
2% for Plummer models, while it is 5% for Hernquist models. We emphasise that
the existence of Sedna is a generic outcome. We define a `concentration radius'
for the inner Oort cloud and find that its value increases with increasing
number of stars in the cluster, ranging from 600 AU to 1500 AU for Hernquist
clusters and from 1500 AU to 4000 AU for Plummer clusters...

processes involving macromolecules. The paper presents a classification of
protein residues based on the normalized equilibrium fluctuations of the
residue centers of mass in proteins and a statistical analysis of conformation
changes in the side-chains upon binding. Normal mode analysis and an elastic
network model were applied to a set of protein complexes to calculate the
residue fluctuations and develop the residue classification. Comparison with a
classification based on normalized B-factors suggests that the B-factors may
underestimate protein flexibility in solvent. Our classification shows that
protein loops and disordered fragments are enriched with highly fluctuating
residues and depleted with weakly fluctuating residues. To calculate the
dihedral angles distribution functions, the configuration space was divided
into cells by a cubic grid. The effect of protein association on the
distribution functions depends on the amino acid type and a grid step in the
dihedral angles space. The changes in the dihedral angles increase from the
near-backbone dihedral angle to the most distant one, for most residues. On
average, one fifth of the interface residues change the rotamer state upon
binding, whereas the rest of the interface residues undergo local readjustments

before and after annealing with BaAs powder. The annealing remarkably improves
transport properties, in particular the magnitude of residual resistivity which
decreases by a factor of more than 10. From the resistivity measurement on
detwinned crystals we found that the anisotropy of the in-plane resistivity is
remarkably diminished after annealing, indicative of dominant contributions to
the charge transport from the carriers with isotropic and high mobility below
magnetostructural transition temperature $T_{\rm s}$ and the absence of nematic
state above $T_{\rm s}$. We found that the Hall resistivity shows strong
non-linearity against magnetic field and the magnetoresistance becomes very
large at low temperatures. These results give evidence for the manifestation of
multiple carriers with distinct characters in the ordered phase below $T_{\rm
s}$. By analyzing the magnetic field dependences, we found that at least three
carriers equally contribute to the charge transport in the ordered phase, which
is in good agreement with the results of recent quantum oscillation
measurements.

of a U(1) charge-two diatom condensate in the system. By promoting the global
U(1) symmetry of the theory to a gauge symmetry, we find that the mass of the

superfluid density via the Meissner effect and the superfluid density is
related to the square of the anomalous density in the Bose system.

models. Stellar and wind parameters are determined by line profile fitting of
hydrogen, helium and nitrogen lines, based on synthetic spectra calculated by

all nitrogen lines present in the available optical spectra. The dominating
process responsible for emission at NIV lambda4058 in O-stars is the strong
depopulation of the lower level of the transition, which increases as a
function of Mdot. Unlike the NIII triplet emission, resonance lines do not play
a role for typical mass-loss rates and below. The bulk of our sample O-stars
seems to be strongly nitrogen-enriched, and a clear correlation of nitrogen and
helium enrichment is found. By comparing the nitrogen abundances as a function
of vsini ('Hunter-plot') with tailored evolutionary calculations, we identify a
considerable number of highly enriched objects at low rotation. Due to the low
initial abundance, the detection of strong Nitrogen enrichment in the bulk of
O-stars indicates that efficient mixing takes place already during the very

impurity scattering due to suppressed backscattering in the Dirac surface
states. We solve a lattice model of a three-dimensional TI in the presence of
strong potential impurities and find that both the Dirac point and low-energy
states are significantly modified: low-energy impurity resonances are formed
that produce a peak in the density of states near the Dirac point, which is
destroyed and split into two nodes that move off-center. The impurity-induced
states penetrate up to 10 layers into the bulk of the TI. These findings
demonstrate the importance of bulk states for the stability of TIs and how they
can destroy the topological protection of the surface.

extragalactic origin, and stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). The
abundance pattern of Pal 14 is almost identical to those of Pal 3 and Pal 4,
the next distant members of the outer halo GC population after Pal 14. The
abundance pattern of Pal 14 is also similar to those of the inner halo GCs,
halo field stars, and GCs of recognized extragalactic origin, but differs from
what is customarily found in dSphs field stars. The abundance properties of Pal
14 as well as those of the other outer halo GCs are thus compatible with an
accretion origin from dSphs. Whether or not GC accretion played a role, it
seems that the formation conditions of outer halo GCs and GCs in dSphs were

Both are very similar, but uniaxial stress presents a critical stress
{\sigma}xa smaller (0.33(5)GPa) than the hydrostatic critical pressure px =0.5
GPa where the ground state switches from HO (hidden order) to AF
(antiferromagnetic) ground state. From these critical values and from Larmor
neutron diffraction (LND), we conclude that the magnetic properties are
governed by the shortest U-U distance in the plane (a lattice parameter). Under
stress, the orthorhombic unit cell stays centered. A key point shown by this
study is the presence of a threshold for the uniaxial stress along the a-axis
before the appearance of the large AF moment which indicates no-mixture of
order parameter (OP) between the HO ground state and the AF one as under
hydrostatic pressure. The two most intense longitudinal magnetic excitations at
Q0=(1,0,0) and Q1=(0.6,0,0) were measured in the HO state: the excitation at Q0
decreases in energy while the excitation at Q1 increases in energy with the
uniaxial stress along the a-axis. The decrease of the energy of the excitation
at Q0 seems to indicate a critical energy gap value of 1.2(1) meV at

(M_\nu) consistent with the bi-pair neutrino mixing, which is recently proposed
to describe neutrino mixings given by \sin\theta_{13}=0 for the reactor
neutrino mixing, \sin^2\theta_{12} = 1-1/\sqrt{2} for the solar neutrino mixing
and either \sin^2\theta_{23} = \tan^2\theta_{12} or
\sin^2\theta_{23}=1-\tan^2\theta_{12} for the atmospheric neutrino mixing.
Sizes of Majorana CP phases are evaluated so as to generate the observed baryon
asymmetry in the universe via a leptogenesis scenario within the framework of
the minimal seesaw model, where M_\nu satisfies det(M_\nu)=0 and one active
Majorana CP phase (\phi) is present. Assuming the normal mass hierarchy for
light neutrinos and one zero texture for a 3X2 Dirac neutrino mass matrix, we
find that \phi lies in the region of 0.69<|\phi|<0.92 [rad], which is converted
into allowed regions of \alpha=arg(M_{e\mu}) and \beta=arg(M_{e\tau}), where
M_{ij} (i,j=e,\mu,\tau) denote the i-j matrix element of M_\nu. The phases
\alpha and \beta turn out to satisfy 0.31<|\alpha|<0.40 [rad] and
-1.25<\beta<-0.32 [rad]. The approximate numerical equality of |\phi|\approx
2|\alpha| is consistent with our theoretical estimation of \phi=\phi_2-\phi_3
for \phi_2=-(\alpha+\beta) and \phi_3\approx \alpha-\beta valid for the normal
mass hierarchy. We also find the following scaling property:
(M'^{\mu\mu}-M'^{ee}/t^2_{12})/M'^{\mu\tau}=M'^{\mu\tau}/(M'^{\tau\tau}-M'^{ee}/t^2_{12})=-M'^{e\tau}/M'^{e\mu}

interactive exploration of parameter spaces of multi-variate simulation models.
To get the right parameter configuration, model developers frequently have to
go back and forth between setting parameters and qualitatively judging the
outcomes of their model. During this process, they build up a grounded
understanding of the parameter effects in order to pick the right setting.
Current state-of-the-art tools and practices, however, fail to provide a
systematic way of exploring these parameter spaces, making informed decisions
about parameter settings a tedious and workload-intensive task. Paraglide
endeavors to overcome this shortcoming by assisting the sampling of the
parameter space and the discovery of qualitatively different model outcomes.
This results in a decomposition of the model parameter space into regions of
distinct behaviour. We developed paraglide in close collaboration with experts
from three different domains, who all were involved in developing new models
for their domain. We first analyzed current practices of six domain experts and
derived a set of design requirements, then engaged in a longitudinal
user-centered design process, and finally conducted three in-depth case studies
underlining the usefulness of our approach.

A subset A of vertices of a graph G is d-independent if the distance between

non-turbulent and thus highly conducting (or non-diffusive) because the
hydrodynamic and/or magnetorotational (MRI) instabilities are suppressed high
in the disk where the magnetic and radiation pressures are larger than the
plasma thermal pressure. Here, we calculate the vertical profiles of the {\it
stationary} accretion flows (with radial and azimuthal components), and the
profiles of the large-scale, magnetic field taking into account the turbulent
viscosity and diffusivity and the fact that the turbulence vanishes at the
surface of the disk.
  Also, here we require that the radial accretion speed be zero at the disk's
surface and we assume that the ratio of the turbulent viscosity to the
turbulent magnetic diffusivity is of order unity. Thus at the disk's surface
there are three boundary conditions. As a result, for a fixed dimensionless
viscosity $\alpha$-value, we find that there is a definite relation between the
ratio ${\cal R}$ of the accretion power going into magnetic disk winds to the
viscous power dissipation and the midplane plasma-$\beta$, which is the ratio
of the plasma to magnetic pressure in the disk. For a specific disk model with
${\cal R}$ of order unity we find that the critical value required for a
stationary solution is $\beta_c \approx 2.4r/(\alpha h)$, where $h$ the disk's
half thickness. For weaker magnetic fields, $\beta > \beta_c$, we argue that
the poloidal field will advect outward while for $\beta< \beta_c$ it will
advect inward. Alternatively, if the disk wind is negligible (${\cal R} \ll
1$), there are stationary solutions with $\beta \gg \beta_c$.

first develop a criterion to detect the potential values of supports and

appeared is found using a gas code. The nature of the oscillations is
investigated and it is shown that the oscillations can be understood by
focusing on the behaviour of the heavier component, because of mass
segregation. It is argued that, during each oscillation, the re-collapse of the
cluster begins at larger radii while the core is still expanding. This
re-collapse can halt and reverse a gravothermally driven expansion. This
material outside the core contracts because it is losing energy both to the
cool expanding core and to the material at larger radii. The core collapse
times for each model are also found and discussed. For an appropriately chosen
case, direct N -body runs were carried out, in order to check the results
obtained from the gas model, including evidence of the gravothermal nature of

spectral analysis aimed at determining variations that occur during the burst

HPGSPC, and PDS spectra with several models. Under the assumption that a single
model is able to fit all spectra, we find that the combination of a
multi-temperature black-body disk and a hybrid corona is able to give a
consistent physical explanation of the source behaviour. Our measured
variations in KT_el, tau, KT_in, and R_in appear to be either correlated or
anti-correlated with the count rate in the energy range 1.6-10 keV. The
strongest variations are detected along the burst segments: almost all
parameters exhibit significant variations in the segments that have the highest
fluxes (pulse) with the exception of R_in, which varies continuously and
reaches a maximum just before the peak. The flux of the multi-temperature disk
strongly increases in the pulse and simultaneously the corona contribution is
significantly reduced. The disk luminosity increases in the pulse and the
R_in-T_in correlation can be most successfully interpreted in term of the slim
disk model. In addition, the reduction in the corona luminosity at the bursts
might represent the condensation of the corona onto the disk.

subsystems appear in a wide range of physical settings, and they have a variety
of promising applications in quantum information science. In this thesis the
entanglement of symmetric multipartite states is categorised, with a particular
focus on the pure multi-qubit case and the geometric measure of entanglement.
An essential tool for this analysis is the Majorana representation, a
generalisation of the single-qubit Bloch sphere representation, which allows
for a unique representation of symmetric n qubit states by n points on the
surface of a sphere. Here this representation is employed to search for the
maximally entangled symmetric states of up to 12 qubits in terms of the
geometric measure, and an intuitive visual understanding of the upper bound on
the maximal symmetric entanglement is given. Furthermore, it will be seen that
the Majorana representation facilitates the characterisation of entanglement
equivalence classes such as Stochastic Local Operations and Classical
Communication (SLOCC) and the Degeneracy Configuration (DC). It is found that
SLOCC operations between symmetric states can be described by the Mobius
transformations of complex analysis, which allows for a clear visualisation of
the SLOCC freedoms and facilitates the understanding of SLOCC invariants and
equivalence classes. In particular, explicit forms of representative states for
all symmetric SLOCC classes of up to 5 qubits are derived. Well-known
entanglement classification schemes such as the 4 qubit entanglement families
or polynomial invariants are reviewed in the light of the results gathered
here, which leads to sometimes surprising connections. Some interesting links
and applications of the Majorana representation to related fields of
mathematics and physics are also discussed.

predicts that the magnetopause distance R depends on solar wind dynamic
pressure Pd as a power low R ~ Pd^alpha, where the exponent alpha=-1/6. In the

Chapman-Ferraro current system, field-aligned currents, tail current, and

energies comes from the sensitivity of the four-boson system to a short-range
four-body scale. Each excited $N-$th tetramer energy $B_4^{(N)}$ moves as the
short-range four-body scale changes, while the trimer properties are kept
fixed, with the next excited tetramer $B_4^{(N+1)}$ emerging from the
atom-trimer threshold for a universal ratio $B_4^{(N)}/B_3 = B_4^
{(N)}/B_4^{(N+1)} \simeq 4.6$, which does not depend on $N$. We show that both
channels of the FY decomposition [atom-trimer ($K-$type) and dimer-dimer
($H-$type)] present high momentum tails, which reflect the short-range
four-body scale. We also found that the $H-$channel is favored over $K-$channel
at low momentum when the four-body momentum scale largely overcomes the
three-body one.

Norma arm, at an estimated distance of 13 kpc. During the observation, the
source showed strong variability exceeding two orders of magnitudes, never
observed before from this source. Its X-ray flux varied in the range from 0.1
counts/s to about 15 counts/s, with several bright flares of different
durations (from a few hundreds to a few thousands seconds) and sometimes with a
quasi-periodic behavior. This finding supports the previous suggestion that
IGRJ16418-4532 is a member of the SFXTs class. In our new observation we
measured a pulse period of 1212+/-6 s, thus confirming that this binary
contains a slowly rotating neutron star. During the periods of low luminosity
the source spectrum is softer and more absorbed than during the flares. A soft
excess is present below 2 keV in the cumulative flares spectrum, possibly due
to ionized wind material at a distance similar to the neutron star accretion
radius. The kind of X-ray variability displayed by IGRJ16418-4532, its dynamic
range and time scale,together with the sporadic presence of quasi-periodic
flaring, all are suggestive of a transitional accretion regime between pure
wind accretion and full Roche lobe overflow. We discuss here for the first time

oxygen desorption. By performing temperature-dependent ESR spectroscopy both
before and after thermal annealing, we found that the ESR in SWCNTs can be
reversibly altered via the molecular oxygen content in the samples. Independent
of the presence of adsorbed oxygen, a Curie-law (spin susceptibility $\propto
1/T$) is seen from $\sim$4 K to 300 K, indicating that the probed spins are
finite-level species. For both the pre-annealed and post-annealed sample
conditions, the ESR linewidth decreased as the temperature was increased, a
phenomenon we identify as motional narrowing. From the temperature dependence
of the linewidth, we extracted an estimate of the intertube hopping frequency;
for both sample conditions, we found this hopping frequency to be $\sim$100
GHz. Since the spin hopping frequency changes only slightly when oxygen is
desorbed, we conclude that only the spin susceptibility, not spin transport, is
affected by the presence of physisorbed molecular oxygen in SWCNT ensembles.
Surprisingly, no linewidth change is observed when the amount of oxygen in the
SWCNT sample is altered, contrary to other carbonaceous systems and certain 1D
conducting polymers. We hypothesize that physisorbed molecular oxygen acts as
an acceptor ($p$-type), compensating the donor-like ($n$-type) defects that are
responsible for the ESR signal in bulk SWCNTs.

radial velocities and proper motions to derive the distances, kinematics and
orbital parameters of the sample stars. The targets belonging to each galactic

kinematics or according to their position above the galactic plane, and the
vertical gradients were also estimated. We present here atmospheric parameters,
distances and kinematics for this sample, and a comparison of our kinematic and
metallicity distributions with the Besancon model of the Milky Way. The thick
disc far from the solar neighbourhood is found to differ only slightly from the
thick disc properties as derived in the solar vicinity. For regions where the
thick disc dominates, we measured vertical velocity and metallicity trends of
d(V_phi)/dZ = 19 +/- 8 km/s/kpc and d[M/H]/dZ = -0.14 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc,
respectively. These trends can be explained as a smooth transition between the
different galactic components, although intrinsic gradients could not be
excluded. In addition, a correlation d(V_phi)/d[M/H] = -45 +/- 12 km/s/dex
between the orbital velocity and the metallicity of the thick disc is detected.
This gradient is inconsistent with the SDSS photometric survey analysis, which
did not detect any such trend, and challenges radial migration models of thick
disc formation. Estimations of the scale heights and scale lengths for
different metallicity bins of the thick disc result in consistent values, with
hR~3.4 \pm 0.7 kpc, and hZ~694 \pm 45 pc, showing no evidence of relics of

people in the majority, we show that as long as the guess value is sufficiently

minimum fluctuation. A continuous transition to less efficient condition is
observed when the guess value becomes worse. Hence, people can optimize their
guess value for excess population to optimize the period of being in the

agents always decide completely randomly (random trader) as opposed to the rest
of the population that follow a certain strategy (chartist). For a single
random trader the system becomes fully efficient with majority-minority
crossover occurring every two-days interval on average. For just two random
traders, all the agents have equal gain with arbitrarily small fluctuations.

the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to
disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently
introduced Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) (Weigt et al. (2009) Proc Natl Acad
Sci 106:67). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA,
which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a
large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is
shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating
the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains
examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intra- domain
residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations,
ligand- mediated residue couplings, and inter-domain interactions in protein
oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a
reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein
conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of
protein domain structures, provided the existence of a large number of

out a detailed renormalization group study of the spectral dimension $d_s$ and
walk dimension $d_w$ associated with the effective space-times of
asymptotically safe Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG). We discover three scaling
regimes where these generalized dimensions are approximately constant for an
extended range of length scales: a classical regime where $d_s = d, d_w = 2$, a
semi-classical regime where $d_s = 2d/(2+d), d_w = 2+d$, and the UV-fixed point
regime where $d_s = d/2, d_w = 4$. On the length scales covered by
three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, the resulting spectral dimension is
shown to be in very good agreement with the data. This comparison also provides
a natural explanation for the apparent puzzle between the short distance
behavior of the spectral dimension reported from Causal Dynamical
Triangulations (CDT), Euclidean Dynamical Triangulations (EDT), and Asymptotic

apoptotic switch. There are two proposed hypotheses regarding its internal
working - the indirect activation and direct activation models. Since these
hypotheses form extreme poles of full continuum of intermediate models, we have
constructed more general model with these two models as extreme cases.
  By studying relationship between model parameters and steady-state response
ultrasensitivity we have found optimal interaction pattern which reproduces
behavior of Bcl-2 apoptotic switch. Our results show, that stimulus-response
ultrasensitivity is negatively related to spontaneous activation of Bcl-2
effectors - subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins. We found that ultrasensitivity requires
effector's activation, mediated by another subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins -
activators. We have shown that the auto-activation of effectors forms
ultrasensitivity enhancing feedback loop, only if mediated by monomers, but not
by oligomers. Robustness analysis revealed that interaction pattern proposed by
direct activation hypothesis is able to conserve stimulus-response dependence
and preserve ultrasensitivity despite large changes of its internal parameters.
This ability is strongly reduced as for the intermediate to indirect side of
the models.
  Computer simulation of the more general model presented here suggest, that
stimulus-response ultrasensitivity is an emergent property of the direct
activation model, that cannot originate within model of indirect activation.

renormalized time-ordered product is equivalent to the pointwise product of
classical field theory. The renormalized Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra is then the
classical algebra but written in terms of the time-ordered product, together
with an operator which replaces the ill defined graded Laplacian of the
unrenormalized theory. We identify it with the anomaly term of the anomalous
Master Ward Identity of Brennecke and D\""utsch. Contrary to other approaches we
do not refer to the path integral formalism and do not need to use

of which the sheared base arch, often carrying a small filament, experiences a
miniature version of blowout eruption that produces large-scale coronal mass
ejection (CME). In this paper, we report such a coronal blowout jet with
high-resolution multi-wavelength and multi-angle observations taken from Solar
Dynamics Observatory, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and Big Bear
Solar Observatory. For the first time, we find that a simultaneous bubble-like
and a jet-like CMEs were dynamically related to the blowout jet that showed
cool and hot components next to each other. Our observational results indicate
that: (1) the cool component was resulted from the eruption of the filament
contained within the jet's base arch, and it further caused the bubble-like
CME; (2) the jet-like CME was associated with the hot component, which was the
outward moving heated plasmas generated by the reconnection of the base arch
and its ambient open field lines. On the other hand, bifurcation of the jet's
cool component was also observed, which was resulted from the uncoupling of the
erupting filament's two legs that were highly twisted at the very beginning.
Based on these results, we propose a model to interpret the coronal blowout
jet, of which the external reconnection not only produces the jet-like CME but
also leads to the rising of the filament. Subsequently, internal reconnection
starts underneath the rising filament and thereby causes the bubble-like CME.

density is not simply concentrated in an infinitesimally thin, one-dimensional
current sheet, as found in force-free solutions. In particular, we wish to
determine if a finite pressure current sheet will still involve a singular
current, and if so, what is the nature of the singularity. We use a full MHD
code, with the resistivity set to zero, so that reconnection is not allowed, to
run a series of experiments in which an X-point is perturbed and then is
allowed to relax towards an equilibrium, via real, viscous damping forces.
Changes to the magnitude of the perturbation and the initial plasma pressure
are investigated systematically. The final state found in our experiments is a
""quasi-static"" equilibrium where the viscous relaxation has completely ended,
but the peak current density at the null increases very slowly following an
asymptotic regime towards an infinite time singularity. Using a high grid
resolution allows us to resolve the current structures in this state both in
width and length. In comparison with the well known pressureless studies, the
system does not evolve towards a thin current sheet, but concentrates the
current at the null and the separatrices. The growth rate of the singularity is
found to be tD, with 0 < D < 1. This rate depends directly on the initial
plasma pressure, and decreases as the pressure is increased. At the end of our
study, we present an analytical description of the system in a quasi-static

counter-intuitively, mortality typically rises above its trend during
expansions. This consensus has been tarnished by inconsistent reports on the
specific age groups and mortality causes involved. We show that these
inconsistencies result, in part, from the trend specifications used in previous
panel models. Standard econometric panel analysis involves fitting regression
models using ordinary least squares, employing standard errors which are robust
to temporal autocorrelation. The model specifications include a fixed effect,
and possibly a linear trend, for each time series in the panel. We propose
alternative methodology based on nonlinear detrending. Applying our methodology
on data for the 50 US states from 1980 to 2006, we obtain more precise and

stressed magnetic fields in the solar environment have onlyconsidered the
Lorentz force, neglecting plasma contributions, and therefore, limiting every
equilibrium to that of a force-free field. Aims. Here we begin a study of the
non-resistive evolution of finite beta plasmas and their relaxation to
magnetohydrostatic states, where magnetic forces are balanced by
plasma-pressure gradients, by using a simple 2D scenario involving a
hydromagnetic disturbance to a uniform magnetic field. The final equilibrium
state is predicted as a function of the initial disturbances, with aims to
demonstrate what happens to the plasma during the relaxation process and to see
what effects it has on the final equilibrium state. Methods. A set of numerical
experiments are run using a full MHD code, with the relaxation driven by
magnetoacoustic waves damped by viscous effects. The numerical results are
compared with analytical calculations made within the linear regime, in which
the whole process must remain adiabatic. Particular attention is paid to the
thermodynamic behaviour of the plasma during the relaxation. Results. The
analytical predictions for the final non force-free equilibrium depend only on
the initial perturbations and the total pressure of the system. It is found
that these predictions hold surprisingly well even for amplitudes of the
perturbation far outside the linear regime. Conclusions. Including the effects
of a finite plasma beta in relaxation experiments leads to significant
differences from the force-free case.

to the container walls, as is more evident in the case of a block immersed in a
liquid and in contact to the bottom, in which a \emph{downward} force that
\emph{increases with depth} is observed. In this work, by taking into account
the surface integral of the pressure force exerted by a fluid over the surface
of a body, the general validity of AP is checked. For a body fully surrounded
by a fluid, homogeneous or not, a gradient version of the divergence theorem
applies, yielding a volume integral that simplifies to an upward force which
agrees to the force predicted by AP, as long as the fluid density is a
\emph{continuous function of depth}. For the bottom case, this approach yields
a downward force that increases with depth, which contrasts to AP but is in
agreement to experiments. It also yields a formula for this force which shows
that it increases with the area of contact.

the radiatively driven implosion of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere (BES).
Radiation-hydrodynamical calculations are performed by using operator splitting
to combine Monte Carlo photoionization with grid-based Eulerian hydrodynamics
that includes self-gravity. It is found that the diffuse field has a
significant effect on the nature of radiatively driven collapse which is
strongly coupled to the strength of the driving shock that is established
before impacting the BES. This can result in either slower or more rapid star
formation than expected using the on-the-spot approximation depending on the
distance of the BES from the source object. As well as directly compressing the
BES, stronger shocks increase the thickness and density in the shell of
accumulated material, which leads to short, strong, photo-evaporative ejections
that reinforce the compression whenever it slows. This happens particularly
effectively when the diffuse field is included as rocket motion is induced over
a larger area of the shell surface. The formation and evolution of 'elephant
trunks' via instability is also found to vary significantly when the diffuse
field is included. Since the perturbations that seed instabilities are smeared
out elephant trunks form less readily and, once formed, are exposed to enhanced
thermal compression.
