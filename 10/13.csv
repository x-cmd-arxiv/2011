energy - large flux double scaling limit where the D1-branes action is
dominated by a Chern-Simons-Myers coupling term. As a classical solution to the
matrix model, we find a novel quantized geometry characterized by a quantum
Nambu 3-bracket. Infinite dimensional representations of the quantum Nambu
geometry are constructed which demonstrate that the quantum Nambu geometry is
intrinsically different from the ordinary Lie algebra type noncommutative
geometry. Matrix models for the IIB string, IIA string and M-theory in the
corresponding backgrounds are constructed. A classical solution of a quantum
Nambu geometry in the IIA Matrix string theory gives rise to an expansion of
the fundamental strings into a system of multiple D4-branes and the fluctuation
is found to describe an action for a non-abelian 3-form field strength which is
a natural non-abelian generalization of the PST action for a single D4-brane.
In view of the recent proposals of the M5-branes theory in terms of the
D4-branes, we suggest a natural way to include all the KK modes and propose an
action for the the multiple M5-branes in a constant C-field. The worldvolume of
the M5-branes in a C-field is found to be described by a quantum Nambu geometry
with self-dual parameters. It is intriguing that our action is naturally
formulated in terms of a 1-form gauge field living on a six dimensional quantum
Nambu geometry.

tomograms of the FUV lines are calculated which provide evidence for structures
where a gas stream interacts with the accretion disc. We conclude that the line

an asymmetry that has its origin in a line-emitting, localised disc-stream

dominated by complex bands of diatomic and triatomic molecules and not well
described at the line by line level by atmospheric models. M dwarf
metallicities are therefore most commonly derived through less direct
techniques. Several recent publications propose calibrations that provide the
metallicity of an M dwarf from its Ks band absolute magnitude and its V-Ks
color, but disagree at the \pm0.1 dex level. We compare these calibrations on a
sample of 23 M dwarfs, which we select as wide (> 5 arcsec) companions of F-,
G- or K- dwarfs with metallicities measured on a homogeneous scale, and which
we require to have V band photometry measured to better than \sim0.03
magnitude. We find that the Schlaufman & Laughlin (2010) calibration has lowest
offsets and residuals against our sample, and use our improved statistics to
marginally refine that calibration. With more strictly selected photometry than
in previous studies, the dispersion around the calibration is well in excess of
the [Fe/H] and photometric uncertainties. This suggests that the origin of the
remaining dispersion is astrophysical rather than observational.

ambiguity- resolution algorithms. Moreover, the findings of both Metcalf et al.

performance can be diminished when the observed field fails to conform to that

main difference of studied structure in contrast to the planar structure with a
single dielectric bar in the unit cell is appearing of a great red shift of a
trapped mode resonant wavelength. The red shift is caused by strong coupling of
electromagnetic fields in neighbor dielectric bar resonators. This property is
very attractive to design resonant periodic planar structures by using moderate
refractive index materials like semiconductors within their transparency
window. In the near infrared band, the trapped mode resonances of periodic
planar structure with bars made of germanium have been studied. It is shown
that decreasing of structure asymmetry degree results in increasing of both red

energy spectrum shows a power law continuum absorbed by a large equivalent
hydrogen column on the order of 10^24 cm^2 and a prominent Fe K-alpha
fluorescent emission line. Besides the Fe K-alpha line, evidence for Fe K-beta,
Ni K-alpha, Ni K-beta, S K-alpha, Ar K-alpha, Ca K-alpha, and Cr K-alpha
fluorescent lines is found. The observed line strengths are consistent with
fluorescence in a cold absorber. This is the first time that a Cr K-alpha line
is seen in emission in the X-ray spectrum of a HMXB. In addition to the
modulation by the strong pulse period of ~685 sec the source is highly variable
and shows different states of activity. We perform time-resolved as well as
pulse-to-pulse resolved spectroscopy to investigate differences between these
states of activity. We find that the fluorescent line fluxes are strongly
variable and generally follow the overall flux. The N_H value is variable by a
factor of 2, but not correlated to the continuum normalization. We find an
interval of low flux in the light curve in which the pulsations cease almost
completely, without any indication of an increasing absorption column. We
investigate this dip in detail and argue that it is most likely that during the
dip the accretion ceased and the afterglow of the fluorescent iron accounted
for the main portion of the X-ray flux. A similar dip was found earlier in RXTE
data, and we compare our findings to these results

spectral range is usually hampered by the lack of emission lines corresponding
to certain ionic stages. So far, the missing emission lines have been accounted
for by the ionisation correction factors (ICFs), constructed under simplistic
assumptions like spherical geometry by using 1-D photoionisation modelling.
  In this contribution we discuss the results (Goncalves et al. 2011, in prep.)
of our ongoing project to find a new set of ICFs to determine total abundances
of N, O, Ne, Ar, and S, with optical spectra, in the case of non-spherical PNe.
These results are based on a grid of 3-D photoionisation modelling of round,
elliptical and bipolar shaped PNe, spanning the typical PN luminosities,
effective temperatures and densities.
  We show that the additional corrections --to the widely used Kingsburgh and
Barlow (1994) ICFs-- are always higher for bipolars than for ellipticals.
Moreover, these additional corrections are, for bipolars, up to: 17% for
oxygen, 33% for nitrogen, 40% for neon, 28% for argon and 50% for sulphur.
Finally, on top of the fact that corrections change greatly with shape, they
vary also greatly with the central star temperature, while the luminosity is a
less important parameter.

here advance the latter with a more adequate community modeling based on
network clustering. The resulting algorithm is evaluated on various synthetic
benchmark networks and random graphs. It is shown to be comparable to current
state-of-the-art algorithms, however, in contrast to other approaches, it does
not require some prior knowledge of the true community structure. To
demonstrate its generality, we further employ the proposed algorithm for
community detection in different unipartite and bipartite real-world networks,
for generalized community detection and also predictive data clustering.

distributions of the vorticity two-form $\omega$ in $R^4$. These distributions
are supported on two-dimensional surfaces termed {\it membranes} and are the
analogs of vortex filaments in $R^3$ and point vortices in $R^2$. The
self-induced velocity field of a membrane is shown to be unbounded and is
regularized using a local induction approximation (LIA). The regularized
self-induced velocity field is then shown to be proportional to the mean
curvature vector field of the membrane but rotated by 90 degrees in the plane
of normals. Next, the Hamiltonian membrane model is presented. The symplectic
structure for this model is derived from a general formula for vorticity
distributions due to Marsden and Weinstein (1983). Finally, the dynamics of the
four-form $\omega \wedge \omega$ is examined. It is shown that Ertel's

technique employs multi-coset sampling and incorporates the advantages of
compressed sensing (CS) when the power spectrum is sparse, but applies to
sparse and nonsparse power spectra alike. The estimates are consistent
piecewise constant approximations whose resolutions (width of the piecewise
constant segments) are controlled by the periodicity of the multi-coset
sampling. We show that compressive estimates exhibit better tradeoffs among the
estimator's resolution, system complexity, and average sampling rate compared
to their noncompressive counterparts. For suitable sampling patterns,
noncompressive estimates are obtained as least squares solutions. Because of
the non-negativity of power spectra, compressive estimates can be computed by
seeking non-negative least squares solutions (provided appropriate sampling
patterns exist) instead of using standard CS recovery algorithms. This
flexibility suggests a reduction in computational overhead for systems
estimating both sparse and nonsparse power spectra because one algorithm can be
used to compute both compressive and noncompressive estimates.

point to the correlation between the quality of the deterministic solution and

designed to take into account uncertainties, unfeasible decisions, and
utilities. Even in a single formalism, several variants are often proposed to
model different types of uncertainty (probability, possibility...) or utility
(additive or not). In this article, we introduce an algebraic graphical model
that encompasses a large number of such formalisms: (1) we first adapt previous
structures from Friedman, Chu and Halpern for representing uncertainty,
utility, and expected utility in order to deal with generic forms of sequential
decision making; (2) on these structures, we then introduce composite graphical
models that express information via variables linked by ""local"" functions,
thanks to conditional independence; (3) on these graphical models, we finally
define a simple class of queries which can represent various scenarios in terms
of observabilities and controllabilities. A natural decision-tree semantics for
such queries is completed by an equivalent operational semantics, which induces
generic algorithms. The proposed framework, called the
Plausibility-Feasibility-Utility (PFU) framework, not only provides a better
understanding of the links between existing formalisms, but it also covers yet
unpublished frameworks (such as possibilistic influence diagrams) and unifies
formalisms such as quantified boolean formulas and influence diagrams. Our
backtrack and variable elimination generic algorithms are a first step towards

find a relatively uniform Sigma_HI ~ 6-8 Msun pc^-2 for both dark and

formation still remain as open questions. We also compare H2 and CO

unstructured peer-to-peer network, which typically follows for many hours after
a flash crowd initiation. The model includes the case that peers can have some
pieces at the time of arrival. The contribution of the paper is to identify how
much help is needed from the seeds, either fixed seeds or peer seeds (which are
peers remaining in the system after obtaining a complete collection) to
stabilize the system. The dominant cause for instability is the missing piece
syndrome, whereby one piece becomes very rare in the network. It is shown that
stability can be achieved with only a small amount of help from peer
seeds--even with very little help from a fixed seed, peers need dwell as peer
seeds on average only long enough to upload one additional piece. The region of
stability is insensitive to the piece selection policy. Network coding can
substantially increase the region of stability in case a portion of the new
peers arrive with randomly coded pieces.

we show that the excited-state properties of these unique chiral nanorings
exhibit anomalous and extremely interesting optoelectronic properties, with
excitation energies growing larger as a function of size (in contradiction with

armchair nanorings is forbidden with a weak oscillator strength, we find that
the same excitation in chiral nanorings is allowed due to a strong geometric
symmetry breaking. Most importantly, among all the possible nanorings
synthesized in this fashion, we show that only one ring, corresponding to a

photoinduced transitions that are most readily observable in spectroscopic

communicated to the soft scalar masses by extra gauge interactions at the tree

observability of sfermion masses at the Large Hadron Collider, it follows that
the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle is a gravitino with a mass of the order of

Level Gauge Mediation spectrum leads to an overabundance of the Dark Matter
relic density and a tension with the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
This suggests to relax the exact conservation of the R-parity. The underlying

a rationale for considering only bilinear R-parity violating operators. We
finally analyze the cosmological implications of this setup by identifying the

isovector vector ($\rho$) fields. The lagrangian exhibits a nonlinear

incorporates vector meson dominance. First, we discuss the EW interactions at
the quark level. Then we include EW interactions in QHD EFT by using the
background-field technique. The completed QHD EFT has a nonlinear realization
of $SU(2)_L \otimes SU(2)_R \otimes U(1)_B$ (chiral symmetry and baryon number
conservation), as well as realizations of other symmetries including
Lorentz-invariance, $C$, $P$, and $T$. Meanwhile, as we know, chiral symmetry
is manifestly broken due to the nonzero quark masses; the $P$ and $C$
symmetries are also broken because of weak interactions. These breaking
patterns are parameterized in a general way in the EFT. Moreover, we have
included the $\Delta$ resonance as manifest degrees of freedom in our QHD EFT,
with a discussion of the irrelevance of the well-known pathologies involving
high-spin fields from the modern EFT perspective. This enables us to discuss
physics at the kinematics where the resonance becomes important. As a result,
the effective theory uses hadronic degrees of freedom, satisfies the
constraints due to QCD (symmetries and their breaking pattern), and is
calibrated to strong-interaction phenomena. Applications to (anti)neutrino
scattering are briefly discussed.

that the agents do not know the opponents utility function). For this model, we
consider issues that are both independent and those that are interdependent and
determine equilibria for each case for each procedure. In so doing, we show
that the package deal is in fact the optimal procedure for each party. We then
go on to show that, although the package deal may be computationally more

This is an ideal target for asteroseismic investigations, because precise
astrometric measurements are available from Hipparcos that greatly help in
constraining the theoretical interpretation of the results. The star was
observed during six nights in August 2009 by means of the high-resolution
\'echelle spectrograph SARG operating with the TNG 3.58 m Italian telescope on
the Canary Islands, exploiting the iodine cell technique. We present the result
and the detailed analysis of high-precision radial velocity measurements, where
the possibility of detecting time individual p-mode frequencies for the first
and deriving their corresponding asymptotic values will be discussed. The
time-series analysis carried out from \sim 800 collected spectra shows the
typical p-mode frequency pattern with a maximum centered at 416 \muHz. In the
frequency range 300 - 600 \muHz we identified for the first time six high S/N
(\gtrsim 3.5) modes with l = 0,2 and 11 < n < 16 and three possible candidates
for mixed modes (l = 1), although the p-mode identification for this type of
star appears to be quite difficult owing to a substantial presence of avoided
crossings. The large frequency separation and the surface term from the set of
identified modes by means of the asymptotic relation were derived for the first
time. Their values are \Delta \nu = 29.56 \pm 0.10 \muHz and \epsilon = 1.29

velocities for 451 GCs around M87, with projected radii from ~ 5 to 185 kpc. We
combine these measurements with literature data for a total sample of 737
objects, which we use for a re-examination of the kinematics of the GC system
of M87. The velocities are analyzed in the context of archival wide-field
photometry and a novel Hubble Space Telescope catalog of half-light radii,
which includes sizes for 344 spectroscopically confirmed clusters. We use this
unique catalog to identify 18 new candidate ultra-compact dwarfs, and to help
clarify the relationship between these objects and true GCs.
  We find much lower values for the outer velocity dispersion and rotation of
the GC system than in earlier papers, and also differ from previous work in
seeing no evidence for a transition in the inner halo to a potential dominated
by the Virgo cluster, nor for a truncation of the stellar halo. We find little
kinematical evidence for an intergalactic GC population. Aided by the precision
of the new velocity measurements, we see significant evidence for kinematical
substructure over a wide range of radii, indicating that M87 is in active
assembly. A simple, scale-free analysis finds less dark matter within ~85 kpc
than in other recent work, reducing the tension between X-ray and optical
results. In general, out to a projected radius of ~ 150 kpc, our data are
consistent with the notion that M87 is not dynamically coupled to the Virgo
cluster; the core of Virgo may be in the earliest stages of assembly.

dwarf galaxies (UCDs) can be explained if their stellar initial mass function
(IMF) was top-heavy, i.e. that the IMF was skewed towards high mass stars. In
this case, neutron stars and black holes would provide unseen mass in the UCDs.
In order to test this scenario with an independent method, we use data on which
fraction of UCDs has a bright X-ray source. These X-ray sources are interpreted
as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), i.e. binaries where a neutron star accretes
matter from an evolving low-mass star. We find that LMXBs are indeed up to 10
times more frequent in UCDs than expected if the IMF was invariant. The
top-heavy IMF required to account for this overabundance is the same as needed
to explain the unusually high mass-to-light ratios of UCDs and a top-heavy IMF
appears to be the only simultaneous explanation for both findings. Furthermore,
we show that the high rate of type II supernovae (SNII) in the star-burst
galaxy Arp 220 suggests a top-heavy IMF in that system. This finding is
consistent with the notion that star-burst galaxies are sites where UCDs are
likely to be formed and that the IMF of UCDs is top-heavy. It is estimated that
the IMF becomes top-heavy whenever the star formation rate per volume surpasses
0.1 Solar masses per year and cubic parsec in pc-scale regions.

scales of L_J ~ 400pc. We identify star-forming regions on these scales and
show that they are 10x denser than those in quiescent environments in local
galaxies, and significantly offset from the local molecular cloud scaling
relations (Larson's relations). The large offset compared to local molecular
cloud linewidth-size scaling relations imply that supersonic turbulence should
remain dominant on scales ~100x smaller than in the kinematically quiescent ISM
of the Milky Way, while the molecular gas in SMMJ2135 is expected to be ~50x
denser than that in the Milky Way on all scales. This is most likely due to the
high external hydrostatic pressure we measure for the interstellar medium

result is useful in interpreting 'density functional +U' and 'density

the 'double counting correction' which dictates the occupancy of these

Density functional calculations yield d-occupancies very far from the Mott

that there are no technical challenges to obtaining fairly high precision light

sources of variability may dominate, it is even possible to reach into the

the Galaxy's dwarfs may have fallen in with the LMC and SMC, and were formed as
part of the Magellanic system in the nearby universe. We use the latest

radio emissivity to cluster magnetic field strength, intracluster turbulence,
and density. We vary several free parameters of this model and find that radio
halo number counts vary by up to a factor of two for average magnetic fields
ranging from 0.2 to 3.1 uG. However, we predict significantly fewer
low-frequency radio halos than expected from previous semi-analytic estimates,
although this discrepancy could be explained by frequency-dependent radio halo
probabilities as predicted in reacceleration models. We find that upcoming
surveys will have difficulty in distinguishing models because of large
uncertainties and low number counts. Additionally, according to our modeling we
find that expected number counts can be degenerate with both reacceleration and
hadronic secondary models of cosmic ray generation. We find that relations
between radio power and mass and X-ray luminosity may be used to distinguish
models, and by building mock radio sky maps we demonstrate that surveys such as

multi-wavelength analysis on Extremely Red Galaxy populations is first
presented in one of the most intensively observed patch of the sky, the Chandra
Deep Field South. By adopting a purely statistical methodology, we consider all
the photometric and spectroscopic information available on large samples of
Extremely Red Objects (EROs, 553 sources), IRAC EROs (IEROs, 259 sources), and
Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs, 289 sources). We derive general properties:
redshift distributions, AGN host fraction, star-formation rate densities, dust
content, morphology, mass functions and mass densities. The results point to
the fact that EROs, IEROs, and DRGs all belong to the same population, yet seen
at different phases of galaxy evolution. The second part of this thesis is
dedicated to the AGN selection in the IR, with particular relevance to the
James Webb Space Telescope, to be launched in 2018. We develop an improved IR
criterion (using K and IRAC bands) as an alternative to existing IR AGN
criteria for the z<2.5 regime, and develop another IR criterion which reliably
selects AGN hosts at 0<z<7 (using K, Spitzer-IRAC, and Spitzer-MIPS24um bands,
KIM). The ability to track AGN activity since the end of reionization holds
great advantages for the study of galaxy evolution. The thesis then focus on
the importance of dust. Based on deep IR data on the Cosmological Survey, we
derive rest-frame 1.6, 3.3, and 6.2um luminosity functions and their dependency
on redshift. We estimate the dust contribution to those wavelengths and show
that the hot dust luminosity density evolves since z=1-2 with a much steeper
drop than the star-formation history of the Universe. Future prospects are
finally discussed in the last chapter.

orbit around a G0-star with twice the metallicity of the Sun. A recent
thermochemical equilibrium analysis based on Spitzer and ground-based infrared
observations suggests that the presence of $\ch4$ in its atmosphere and the
lack of $\h2o$ features can only be explained if the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in
the planet's atmosphere is much greater than the solar ratio ($\ctoo = 0.54$).
Here, we use a 1-D photochemical model to study the effect of disequilibrium
chemistry on the observed abundances of $\h2o, \com, \co2$ and $\ch4$ in the
WASP-12b atmosphere. We consider two cases: one with solar $\ctoo$ and another
with $\ctoo = 1.08$. The solar case predicts that $\h2o$ and $\com$ are more
abundant than $\co2$ and $\ch4$, as expected, whereas the high $\ctoo$ model
shows that $\com$, C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and HCN are more abundant. This indicates
that the extra carbon from the high $\ctoo$ model is in hydrocarbon species.
$\h2o$ photolysis is the dominant disequilibrium mechanism that alters the
chemistry at higher altitudes in the solar $\ctoo$ case, whereas
photodissociation of C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and HCN is significant in the super-solar
case. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that $\c2h2$ is the major absorber in
the atmosphere of WASP-12b and the absorption features detected near 1.6 and 8
micron may be arising from C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ rather than $\ch4$. The Hubble Space
Telescope's WFC3 can resolve this discrepancy, as $\c2h2$ has absorption
between $1.51 - 1.54$ microns, while $\ch4$ does not.

precession by using detailed He WD models. We find that apsidal precession can

tides dominate the precession at orbital frequencies above ~0.01 mHz (~1 mHz).
Analyzing the apsidal precession of these sources only accounting for GR would

A
problem from VCSP is characterised by a \emph{constraint language}, a fixed set
of cost functions over a finite domain. An instance of the problem is specified
by a sum of cost functions from the language and the goal is to minimise the
sum.
  We consider the case of languages containing all possible unary cost
functions. In the case of languages consisting of only $\{0,\infty\}$-valued
cost functions (i.e. relations), such languages have been called
\emph{conservative} and studied by Bulatov [LICS'03] and recently by Barto
[LICS'11]. Since we study valued languages, we call a language conservative if
it contains all finite-valued unary cost functions. The complexity of
conservative valued languages has been studied by Cohen et al. [AIJ'06] for
languages over Boolean domains, by Deineko et al. [JACM'08] for
$\{0,1\}$-valued languages (a.k.a Max-CSP), and by Takhanov [STACS'10] for
$\{0,\infty\}$-valued languages containing all finite-valued unary cost
functions (a.k.a. Min-Cost-Hom).
  We prove a Schaefer-like dichotomy theorem for conservative valued languages:
if all cost functions in the language satisfy a certain condition (specified by
a complementary combination of \emph{STP and MJN multimorphisms}), then any
instance can be solved in polytime (via a new algorithm developed in this
paper), otherwise the language is NP-hard. This is the \emph{first} complete
complexity classification of \emph{general-valued constraint languages} over
non-Boolean domains.
  This generalises previous results by Takhanov [STACS'10] and (a subset of
results) by Cohen et al. [AIJ'06] and Deineko et al. [JACM'08]. Moreover, our
results do not rely on any computer-assisted search as in Deineko et al.
[JACM'08], and provide a powerful tool for proving hardness of finite- and
general-valued languages.

applications. In this work we provide novel perspectives on finding
(dis)similar vertices within a network and across two networks with the same
number of vertices (graph matching). With respect to the former problem, we
propose to optimize a geometric objective which allows us to express each
vertex uniquely as a convex combination of a few extreme types of vertices. Our
method has the important advantage of supporting efficiently several types of
queries such as ""which other vertices are most similar to this vertex?"" by the
use of the appropriate data structures and of mining interesting patterns in
the network. With respect to the latter problem (graph matching), we propose
the generalized condition number --a quantity widely used in numerical
analysis-- $\kappa(L_G,L_H)$ of the Laplacian matrix representations of $G,H$
as a measure of graph similarity, where $G,H$ are the graphs of interest. We
show that this objective has a solid theoretical basis and propose a
deterministic and a randomized graph alignment algorithm. We evaluate our
algorithms on both synthetic and real data. We observe that our proposed
methods achieve high-quality results and provide us with significant insights
into the network structure.

leads to metallic conductivity and below Tc to superconductivity. Plaquettes
disconnected from the percolating swath are found to have degenerate states at
the Fermi level that split and lead to the pseudogap. The pseudogap can be
calculated by simply counting the spatial distribution of isolated plaquettes,
leading to an excellent fit to experiment. This provides strong evidence in
favor of inhomogeneous plaquettes in cuprates.

above the thermal emission of the cooling compact objects (request-I) and also
dominate over the energy output due to the accretion of normal matter onto the

and the critical density sensitively depends on the residual surface

no analog in equilibrium systems. One of such features concerns large rare
excursions far from the stable state in the space of dynamical variables. For
equilibrium systems, the most probable fluctuational trajectory to a given
state is related to the fluctuation-free trajectory back to the stable state by
time reversal. This is no longer true for nonequilibrium systems, where the
pattern of the most probable trajectories generally displays singularities.
Here we study how the singularities emerge as the system is driven away from
equilibrium, and whether a driving strength threshold is required for their
onset. Using a resonantly modulated oscillator as a model, we identify two
distinct scenarios, depending on the speed of the optimal path in thermal
equilibrium. If the position away from the stable state along the optimal path
grows exponentially in time, the singularities emerge without a threshold. We
find the scaling of the location of the singularities as a function of the
control parameter. If the growth away from the stable state is faster than
exponential, characterized by the ability to reach infinity in finite time,
there is a threshold for the onset of singularities, which we study for the
model.

orders of magnitude in [Fe/H]. We fit the relationship between A(Be) and [O/H]
with both a single slope and with two slopes. The relationship between [Fe/H]
and [O/H] seems robustly linear and we conclude that the slope change in Be vs.
O is due to the Be abundance. Although Be is a by-product of CNO, we have used
Ti and Mg abundances as alpha-element surrogates for O in part because O
abundances are rather sensitive to both stellar temperature and surface
gravity. We find that A(Be) tracks [Ti/H] very well with a slope of 1.00

analyzed in detail, by using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and Thomas-Fermi

profiles at finite temperatures are explicitly obtained. Our results show that
when the temperature of the condensate and of the thermal cloud are much
smaller than the critical Bose-Einstein transition temperature, the zero

the early stages of the cosmological evolution of the dark matter condensates.

Brownian motion in the absence of control. The inventory continuously
accumulates cost at a rate that is a general convex function of the inventory
level, which can be negative when there is a backlog. At any time, the
inventory level can be adjusted by a positive or negative amount, which incurs
a fixed cost and a proportional cost. The challenge is to find an adjustment
policy that balances the holding cost and adjustment cost to minimize the
long-run average cost. When both upward and downward fixed costs are positive,
our model is an impulse control problem. When both fixed costs are zero, our
model is a singular or instantaneous control problem. For the impulse control
problem, we prove that a four-parameter control band policy is optimal among
all feasible policies. For the singular control problem, we prove that a
two-parameter control band policy is optimal.
  We use a lower-bound approach, widely known as ""the verification theorem"", to
prove the optimality of a control band policy for both the impulse and singular
control problems. Our major contribution is to prove the existence of a
""smooth"" solution to the free boundary problem under some mild assumptions on
the holding cost function. The existence proof leads naturally to numerical
algorithms to compute the optimal control band parameters. We demonstrate that
the lower-bound approach also works for Brownian inventory model in which no
inventory backlog is allowed. In a companion paper, we will show how the
lower-bound approach can be adapted to study a Brownian inventory model under a
discounted cost criterion.

the stellar populations and physical conditions. We compare star formation
rates as measured from the SED fit, the H-alpha and [OII] emission lines, and
the UV+IR bolometric luminosity where 24 micron photometry is available. The
SFR estimate from the SED fit is consistently higher than the other indicators,
which suggests that the Calzetti dust extinction law used in the SED fitting is
too flat for young star-forming galaxies at z~2. Our analysis finds similar
stellar population parameters for all four lensed galaxies: stellar masses
3-7*10^9 M_sun, young ages ~ 100 Myr, little dust content E(B-V)=0.10-0.25, and
star formation rates around 20-100 M_sun/yr. Compared to typical values for the

starbursting systems that have only recently started the build-up of stellar
mass. These results constitute the first detailed, uniform analysis of a sample

major inconsistency between theoretical LambdaCDM expectations and
measurements. Triaxiality and orientation biases might be at the origin of this
disagreement, as clusters elongated along the line-of-sight would have a
relatively higher projected mass density, boosting the resulting lensing
properties. Analyses of statistical samples can probe further these effects and
crucially reduce biases. In this work we perform a fully triaxial
strong-lensing analysis of the 12 MACS clusters at z > 0.5, a complete X-ray
selected sample, and fully account for the impact of the intrinsic 3D shapes on
their strong lensing properties. We first construct strong-lensing mass models
for each cluster based on multiple-images, and fit projected ellipsoidal
Navarro-Frenk-White halos with arbitrary orientations to each mass
distribution. We then invert the measured surface mass densities using Bayesian
statistics. Although the Einstein radii of this sample are significantly larger
than predicted by LambdaCDM, here we find that the mass-concentration relation
is in full agreement with results from N-body simulations. The z > 0.5 MACS
clusters suffer from a moderate form of orientation bias as may be expected for
X-ray selected samples. Being mostly unrelaxed, at a relatively high redshift,
with high X-ray luminosity and noticeable substructures, these clusters may lie

the importance of triaxiality and properly selected samples for understanding
galaxy clusters properties, and suggest that higher-z, unrelaxed
low-concentration clusters form a different class of prominent strong
gravitational lenses. Arc redshift confirmation and weak lensing data in the

elements, is widely used in machine learning and image processing. The basis
set, also called dictionary, is learned to adapt to specific data. This
approach has proven to be very effective in many image processing tasks.
Traditionally, the dictionary is an unstructured ""flat"" set of atoms. In this
paper, we study structured dictionaries which are obtained from an epitome, or
a set of epitomes. The epitome is itself a small image, and the atoms are all
the patches of a chosen size inside this image. This considerably reduces the
number of parameters to learn and provides sparse image decompositions with
shiftinvariance properties. We propose a new formulation and an algorithm for
learning the structured dictionaries associated with epitomes, and illustrate
their use in image denoising tasks.

matter properties is studied within the extended relativistic mean field (ERMF)

terms by using different parametrizations obtained by varying the neutron skin
thickness $\Delta$r and $\omega$-meson self-coupling ($\zeta$). We observed
that the symmetry energy and its slope and incompressibility coefficients
decrease with increasing temperatures up to saturation densities. The ERMF
parametrizations were employed to obtain a new set of equations of state (EOS)
of the protoneutron star (PNS) with and without inclusion of hyperons. In our
calculations, in comparison with cold compact stars, we obtained that the
gravitational mass of the protoneutron star with and without hyperons increased
by $\sim 0.4M_{\odot}$ and its radius increased by $\sim 3$km. Whereas in case
of the rotating PNS, the mass shedding limit decreased with increasing
temperature, and this suggested that the keplerian frequency of the PNS, at T =
10 MeV should be smaller by $14-20%$ for the EOS with hyperon, as compared to
the keplerian frequency of a cold compact star.

to pi^+ pi^- e^+ e^- transitions due to interference between M1, internal
bremsstrahlung and possible E1 amplitudes. Such an effect depends on the
strength of CP violation originating from the ND -- as discussed here for
Little Higgs Models with T parity and non-minimal Higgs sectors -- but also in
the interferences between these amplitudes even in the Standard Model (SM).
More general lessons can be learnt for T asymmetries in non-leptonic D decays
like D to h_1h_2 h_3 h_4. Such manifestations of ND can be tested at LHCb and
other Super-Flavour Factories like the projects at KEK near Tokyo and at Tor

cosmological expansion out to high redshift can be measured without the

a unique probe for dark energy. On the other hand, such a NS-binary foreground
should be subtracted to detect primordial GWs produced during inflation. Thus,
the constraining power on dark energy and the detectability of the primordial
gravitational waves strongly depend on the detector sensitivity and are in
close relation with one another. In this paper, we investigate the constraints
on the equation of state of dark energy with future space-based GW detectors

addition to the classic ""van der Meer scan"" method a novel technique has been
developed which makes use of direct imaging of the individual beams using
beam-gas and beam-beam interactions. This beam imaging method is made possible
by the high resolution of the LHCb vertex detector and the close proximity of
the detector to the beams, and allows beam parameters such as positions, angles
and widths to be determined. The results of the two methods have comparable
precision and are in good agreement. Combining the two methods, an overall
precision of 3.5% in the absolute luminosity determination is reached. The
techniques used to transport the absolute luminosity calibration to the full
2010 data-taking period are presented.

  Channel Information","27 pages, 5 figures, EURASIP Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider $K$ links operating concurrently in the same spectral band. Each
transmitter has multiple antennas, while each receiver uses a single antenna.
This setting corresponds to the multiple-input single-output interference
channel. We assume perfect channel state information at the single-user
decoding receivers whereas the transmitters only have estimates of the true
channels. The channel estimation errors are assumed to be bounded in elliptical
regions whose geometry is known at the transmitters. Robust beamforming
optimizes worst-case received power gains, and a Pareto optimal point is a
worst-case achievable rate tuple from which it is impossible to increase a
link's performance without degrading the performance of another. We
characterize the robust beamforming vectors necessary to operate at any Pareto
optimal point. Moreover, these beamforming vectors are parameterized by
$K(K-1)$ real-valued parameters. We analyze the system's spectral efficiency at
high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Zero forcing transmission achieves
full multiplexing gain at high SNR only if the estimation errors scale linearly
with inverse SNR. If the errors are SNR independent, then single-user
transmission is optimal at high SNR. At low SNR, robust maximum ratio
transmission optimizes the minimum energy per bit for reliable communication.
Numerical simulations illustrate the gained theoretical results.

First, we consider the links to be consumers that can trade goods within

coordination process that is realized by an arbitrator which distributes the
Walrasian prices to the consumers. The consumers then calculate in a
decentralized manner their optimal demand corresponding to beamforming vectors

dominates the noncooperative outcome of the systems. Thus, based on the game

framework for using particle filters (PFs) to construct proposal kernels for
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This framework, termed Particle Markov
chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC), was shown to provide powerful methods for joint
Bayesian state and parameter inference in nonlinear/non-Gaussian state-space
models. However, the mixing of the resulting MCMC kernels can be quite
sensitive, both to the number of particles used in the underlying PF and to the
number of observations in the data. In the discussion following (Andrieu et
al., 2010), Whiteley suggested a modified version of one of the PMCMC samplers,
namely the particle Gibbs (PG) sampler, and argued that this should improve its
mixing. In this paper we explore the consequences of this modification and show
that it leads to a method which is much more robust to a low number of
particles as well as a large number of observations. Furthermore, we discuss
how the modified PG sampler can be used as a basis for alternatives to all
three PMCMC samplers derived in (Andrieu et al., 2010). We evaluate these
methods on several challenging inference problems in a simulation study. One of
these is the identification of an epidemiological model for predicting
influenza epidemics, based on search engine query data.

the p-mode parameters of the solar eigenmode spectrum, which allow us to infer
unique information about the internal structure and dynamics of the Sun. It
also provides insights into the complex solar magnetism. Variations in the mean
strength of the solar magnetic field lead to significant shifts in the
frequencies of even the lowest-degree p modes with high levels of correlation
with surface activity proxies. These frequency shifts are explained to arise
from structural changes in the outer layers of the Sun during the 11-year
activity cycle, which is understood to be driven by a dynamo process. However,
clear differences between p-mode frequencies and surface activity during the
extended minimum of cycle 23 were observed. The origin of the p-mode
variability is thus far from being properly understood and a better
comprehension of its relationship with solar and stellar activity cycles will
help us in our understanding of the dynamo processes. Spectroscopic
measurements of Ca H and K emission lines revealed magnetic activity variations
in a large sample of solar-type stars with timescales ranging from 2.5 and 25
years. This broad range of cycle periods is thought to reflect differences in
the rotational properties and the depths of the surface convection zones with
various masses and ages. However, spectroscopic measurements are only good
proxies of surface magnetic fields. The recent discovery of variations with

observations have lacked the sensitivity and resolution to directly image the

identified unusual polarized structures that often have no counterparts in the

manifested as a complex filamentary web of discontinuities in gas density and
magnetic field. Through comparison with simulations, we demonstrate that
turbulence in the warm ionized medium has a relatively low sonic Mach number,
M_s <~ 2. The development of statistical tools for the analysis of polarization

low-frequency synchrotron component, implying that the inverse Compton SSC
losses of electrons are at least equal to or greater than the synchrotron
losses of electrons. We calculate from the analytical solution of the kinetic
equation of relativistic electrons, subject to the combined linear synchrotron
and nonlinear synchrotron self-Compton cooling, for monoenergetic injection the
time-integrated total synchrotron and SSC radiation fluences and spectral
energy distributions (SED). Depending on the ratio of the initial cooling
terms, displayed by the injection parameter $\alpha$, we find for $\alpha\ll

inverse Compton peak and the usual results of the spectra are recovered. For
$\alpha\gg 1$ the SSC peak dominates the synchrotron peak, proving our
assumption that in such a case the cooling becomes initially non-linear. The

non-linear cooling. To show the potential of the model, we apply it to

a cosmological system. This is not obtained from symmetry reduced variables

that are characteristic of the full theory. The Spinfoam Cosmology obtained in

second strategy exploits the Hamiltonian constraint of Loop Quantum Cosmology,

organization, e.g., the clustering of the constituent nodes into several
communities or modules. Often, such modularity is manifested at several
different hierarchical levels, where the clusters defined at one level appear
as elementary entities at the next higher level. Using a simple model of a
hierarchical modular network, we show that such a topological structure gives
rise to characteristic time-scale separation between dynamics occurring at
different levels of the hierarchy. This generalizes our earlier result for
simple modular networks, where fast intra-modular and slow inter-modular
processes were clearly distinguished. Investigating the process of
synchronization of oscillators in a hierarchical modular network, we show the
existence of as many distinct time-scales as there are hierarchical levels in
the system. This suggests a possible functional role of such mesoscopic
organization principle in natural systems, viz., in the dynamical separation of
events occurring at different spatial scales.

definition of the angle of the latitude in the geoid description leads to a
prolate spheroid (rugby ball shape) instead of an oblate spheroid with the

in the centripetal contribution term. And last but not least, a profound
conceptual mistake was done in believing that an atomic clock or any timekeeper
apparatus was carried in a journey by car or plane between CERN and Gran Sasso;
instead of that atomic clocks are continuously resynchronized through a GPS
device, and the variation of the potential term applies only for the neutrino
travel itself. Thus instead of a $\Delta t \approx 30ns $ correction claimed by
the author in a travel of 12 hours plus 4 days at rest for an atomic clock, we
have found a time correction only for the neutrino itself $\Delta t=3.88 \,
10^{-16} s$! That means, that this paper \cite{Contaldi} does not give the

direct numerical simulation of turbulence. The fact that it uses the fast
multipole method (FMM)--a hierarchical algorithm for N-body problems with
highly scalable parallel implementations--as numerical engine makes it a
potentially good candidate for exascale systems. However, there have been few
validation studies of Lagrangian vortex simulations and the insufficient
comparisons against standard DNS codes has left ample room for skepticism. This
paper presents a comparison between a Lagrangian vortex method and a
pseudo-spectral method for the simulation of decaying homogeneous isotropic
turbulence. This flow field is chosen despite the fact that it is not the most
favorable flow problem for particle methods (which shine in wake flows or where
vorticity is compact), due to the fact that it is ideal for the quantitative
validation of DNS codes. We use a 256^3 grid with Re_lambda=50 and 100 and look
at the turbulence statistics, including high-order moments. The focus is on the
effect of the various parameters in the vortex method, e.g., order of FMM
series expansion, frequency of reinitialization, overlap ratio and time step.
The vortex method uses an FMM code (exaFMM) that runs on GPU hardware using
CUDA, while the spectral code (hit3d) runs on CPU only. Results indicate that,
for this application (and with the current code implementations), the spectral
method is an order of magnitude faster than the vortex method when using a
single GPU for the FMM and six CPU cores for the FFT.

small fraction of the relic density of dark matter (DM) in the Universe. Due to
its strong coupling to the standard model particles, it can be probed by the
current direct detection experiments even it is a subdominant component of the
whole halo DM. Assuming that it contributes to the same fraction of the local
halo DM density as that of the DM relic density, we show that the current
Xenon100 data constrain the mass of the stable Majorana neutrino to be greater
than the mass of the top quark. In the mass range between 200 GeV and a few
hundred GeV, the effective spin-independent cross section for the neutrino
elastic scattering off nucleon is insensitive to the neutrino mass and is
predicted to be $\sim 1.5\times 10^{-44} cm^2$, which can be reached by the
direct DM search experiments soon. In the same mass region the predicted
effective spin-dependent cross section for the heavy neutrino scattering off
proton is in the range $2\times 10^{-40} cm^2\sim 2\times 10^{-39} cm^2$, which
is within the reach of the ongoing IceCube experiment. We demonstrate such

the derivation of the thermal structure and molecular abundances of H2O, CO2,

the technique of optimal estimation to determine the thermal structure and
composition of an exoplanet by solving the inverse problem. The development of
a suite of radiative transfer and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is
described, building upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the
study of our own solar system. First, we discuss the plausibility of detection
of different molecules in the dayside atmosphere of HD 189733b and the
best-fitting spectrum retrieved from all publicly available sets of secondary
eclipse observations between 1.45 and 24 {\mu}m. Additionally, we use
contribution functions to assess the vertical sensitivity of the emission
spectrum to temperatures and molecular composition. Over the altitudes probed
by the contribution functions, the retrieved thermal structure shows an
isothermal upper atmosphere overlying a deeper adiabatic layer (temperature
decreasing with altitude), which is consistent with previously-reported
dynamical and observational results. The formal uncertainties on retrieved
parameters are estimated conservatively using an analysis of the
cross-correlation functions and the degeneracy between different atmospheric
properties. The formal solution of the inverse problem suggests that the
uncertainties on retrieved parameters are larger than suggested in previous
studies, and that the presence of CO and CH4 is only marginally supported by
the available data. Nevertheless, by including as broad a wavelength range as
possible in the retrieval, we demonstrate that available spectra of HD 189733b

purifying selection. Yet in finite asexual populations, purifying selection
cannot completely prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to
Muller's ratchet: once lost by stochastic drift, the most-fit class of
genotypes is lost forever. If deleterious mutations are weakly selected,
Muller's ratchet turns into a mutational ""meltdown"" leading to a rapid
degradation of population fitness. Evidently, the long term stability of an
asexual population requires an influx of beneficial mutations that continuously
compensate for the accumulation of the weakly deleterious ones. Here we propose
that the stable evolutionary state of a population in a static environment is a
dynamic mutation-selection balance, where accumulation of deleterious mutations
is on average offset by the influx of beneficial mutations. We argue that this
state exists for any population size N and mutation rate $U$. Assuming that
beneficial and deleterious mutations have the same fitness effect s, we
calculate the fraction of beneficial mutations, \epsilon, that maintains the
balanced state. We find that a surprisingly low \epsilon suffices to maintain
stability, even in small populations in the face of high mutation rates and
weak selection. This may explain the maintenance of mitochondria and other
asexual genomes, and has implications for the expected statistics of genetic
diversity in these populations.

processes takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rate

mass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. We
use deep far-infrared PACS data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate the
total star formation rate of the Luminous Infrared Galaxy population of 9
clusters with mass ~10^{15} M_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5
x 10^{13} M_{\odot}. Estimates of the field \Sigma(SFR/M) are derived from the
literature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comoving
matter density of the universe. The field \Sigma(SFR/M) increases with redshift
up to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. The evolution of the \Sigma(SFR/M)-z
relation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. Up to redshift
z~0.2, the field has a higher \Sigma(SFR/M) than galaxy groups and galaxy
clusters. At higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar
\Sigma(SFR/M), while massive clusters have significantly lower \Sigma(SFR/M)
than both groups and the field. There is a hint of a reversal of the SFR
activity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \Sigma(SFR/M) lies above the
field \Sigma(SFR/M)-z relation. We discuss possible interpretations of our
results in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

effects and radiative shocks on scales <100 AU. We investigate the combined
effects of magnetic field, turbulence, and radiative transfer on the early
phases of the collapse and the fragmentation of massive dense cores. We
identify a new mechanism that inhibits initial fragmentation of massive dense
cores, where magnetic field and radiative transfer interplay. We show that this
interplay becomes stronger as the magnetic field strength increases. Magnetic
braking is transporting angular momentum outwards and is lowering the
rotational support and is thus increasing the infall velocity. This enhances
the radiative feedback owing to the accretion shock on the first core. We
speculate that highly magnetized massive dense cores are good candidates for
isolated massive star formation, while moderately magnetized massive dense
cores are more appropriate to form OB associations or small star clusters.

involves researchers worldwide, regardless of their place of work and
residence. Globalization of science, in this respect, implies that
collaboration among scientists takes place along the lines of common topics and
irrespective of the spatial distances between the collaborators. The networks
of collaborators, termed 'epistemic communities', should thus have a
space-independent structure. This paper shows that such a notion of globalized
scientific collaboration is not supported by empirical data. It introduces a
novel approach of analyzing distance-dependent probabilities of collaboration.
The results of the analysis of six distinct scientific fields reveal that
intra-country collaboration is about 10-50 times more likely to occur than
international collaboration. Moreover, strong dependencies exist between
collaboration activity (measured in co-authorships) and spatial distance when
confined to national borders. However, the fact that distance becomes
irrelevant once collaboration is taken to the international scale suggests a
globalized science system that is strongly influenced by the gravity of local
science clusters. The similarity of the probability functions of the six
science fields analyzed suggests a universal mode of spatial governance that is
independent from the mode of knowledge creation in science.

historical overview, the properties of cosmic rays are discussed with respect
to different energy ranges. The origin and the propagation of nuclei in the
Galaxy are dealt with from a theoretical point of view. The mechanisms leading
to the acceleration of nuclei by supernova remnants and to their subsequent
diffusion through the inhomogeneities of the galactic magnetic field are
discussed and some clue is given on the predictions and observations of fluxes
of antimatter, both from astrophysical sources and from dark matter
annihilation in the galactic halo. The experimental techniques and
instrumentations employed for the detection of cosmic rays at Earth are
described. Direct methods are viable up to 10^14 eV, by means of experiments
flown on balloons or satellites, while above that energy, due to their very low
flux, cosmic rays can be studied only indirectly by exploiting the particle
cascades they produce in the atmosphere. The possible physical interpretation
of the peculiar features observed in the energy spectrum of galactic cosmic
rays, and in particular the so-called ""knee"" at about 4x10^15 eV, are
discussed. A section is devoted to the region between about 10^18 and 10^19 eV,
which is believed to host the transition between galactic and extragalactic
cosmic rays. The conclusion gives some perspectives on the cosmic ray
astrophysics field. Thanks to a wealth of different experiments, this research
area is living a very flourishing era. The activity is exciting both from the
theoretical and the instrumental sides, and its interconnection with astronomy,

of potential outcomes. During the past century there have been remarkable
advances in the development of theory for this diversification, and the
theory's success rests, in part, on the scope of its applicability. A great
deal of this theory focuses on a relatively small subset of the space of
potential genotypes, chosen largely based on historical or contemporary
patterns, and then predicts the evolutionary dynamics within this pre-defined
set. To what extent can such an approach be pushed to a broader perspective
that accounts for the potential open-endedness of evolutionary diversification?
There have been a number of significant theoretical developments along these
lines but the question of how far such theory can be pushed has not been
addressed. Here a theorem is proven demonstrating that, because of the digital
nature of inheritance, there are inherent limits on the kinds of questions that
can be answered using such an approach. In particular, even in extremely simple
evolutionary systems a complete theory accounting for the potential
open-endedness of evolution is unattainable unless evolution is progressive.

bundles, wound in different stages, which are twisted to counter coupling loss
caused by time-changing external magnet fields. The selection of the twist
pitch lengths has major implications for the performance of the cable in the
case of strain sensitive superconductors, i.e. Nb3Sn, as the electromagnetic
and thermal contraction loads are large but also for the heat load from the AC
coupling loss. Reduction of the transverse load and warm-up cool-down
degradation can be reached by applying longer twist pitches in a particular
sequence for the sub-stages, offering a large cable transverse stiffness,
adequate axial flexibility and maximum allowed lateral strand support. Analysis
of short sample (TF conductor) data reveals that increasing the twist pitch can
lead to a gain of the effective axial compressive strain of more than 0.3 %
with practically no degradation from bending. For reduction of the coupling
loss, specific choices of the cabling twist sequence are needed with the aim to
minimize the area of linked strands and bundles that are coupled and form loops
with the applied changing magnetic field, instead of simply avoiding longer
pitches. In addition we recommend increasing the wrap coverage of the CS
conductor from 50 % to at least 70 %. The models predict significant
improvement against strain sensitivity and substantial decrease of the AC
coupling loss in Nb3Sn CICCs, but also for NbTi CICCs minimization of the
coupling loss can be achieved. Although the success of long pitches to
transverse load degradation was already demonstrated, the prediction of the
combination with low coupling loss needs to be validated by a short sample
test.

analyzed with the numerical cable model JackPot. The precise trajectories of
all individual strands, joint design, cabling configuration, spatial
distribution of the magnetic field, sample geometry and using experimentally
determined interstrand resistance distributions have been taken into account.
Although unable to predict the quench point due to the lack of a
thermal-hydraulic routine, the model allows to assess the instantaneous strand
power at quench and its local distribution in the cable, showing the hot spots,
once the quench conditions in terms of current and temperature are
experimentally known., The analysis points out the relation of the above
mentioned factors with the DC quench stability of both short samples and coils.
The possible small scale and local electrical-thermal interactions were ignored
in order to examine the relevance of such effects in the overall prediction of
the CICC performance The electromagnetic code shows an excellent quantitative
predictive potential for CICC transport properties, excluding any freedom for
matching the results. The influence of the local thermal effects in the
modeling is identified as being marginal and far less than the generally

gravitational energy along a hypothetical photon null path on the geoid non

may be interpreted as a small time-relative ""dressed"" physical rest mass
correction to the photon null mass. This relative gravitational potential
energy determines a proper time delay proportional to the laboratory non
inertial flying time interval along the trajectory with a small factor
5.276x10-5. We also use a geometric technique based on Ehresmann connections to
compare the parallel transport of the photon vector and the neutrino spinor on
null trajectories. The result is that there is a theoretical neutrino time
delay from its inertial path which is half the delay of the photon. Applying
these delays to a hypothetical particle trajectory from the CERN SPS/CNGS
target to the LNGS OPERA detector we find that the difference between the

smaller than the fundamental constant c. The results also indicate that

representing the underlying system. Varying population numbers of microstates
in statistical ensemble result in different expectation values corresponding to
different times. We show a single parameter which equates to the notion of time
is logarithm of the total number of microstates in statistical ensemble. We
discuss the implications of proposed model for some topics of modern physics:
Poincar\'e recurrence theorem vs. Second Law of Thermodynamics, matter vs.
anti-matter asymmetry of the universe, expansion of the universe, Big Bang.

  submission Exploring the virtual reality conjecture. It summarizes three
  chapters of a larger work with detail from a fourth chapter, in preparation.
  Annex A was composed from the ensuing FQXi essay discussion","Prespacetime Journal, Vol 2, No 9, p1404-1433, ISSN: 2153-8301",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We take our world to be an objective reality, but is it? The assumption that
the physical world exists in and of itself has struggled to assimilate the
findings of modern physics for some time now. For example, an objective space
and time would just ""be"", but in relativity, space contracts and time dilates.
Likewise objective ""things"" should just inherently exist, but the entities of
quantum theory are probability of existence smears, that spread, tunnel,
superpose and entangle in physically impossible ways. Cosmology even tells us
that our entire physical universe just ""popped up"", from nowhere, about 14
billion years ago. This is not how an objectively real world should behave! Yet
traditional alternatives don't work much better. That the world is just an
illusion of the mind doesn't explain its consistent realism and Descartes
dualism, that another reality beyond the physical exists, just doubles the
existential problem. It is time to consider an option we might normally dismiss
out of hand. This essay explores the virtual reality conjecture, that the
physical world is the digital output of non-physical quantum processing. It
finds it neither illogical, nor unscientific, nor incompatible with current
physics. In this model, quantum entities are programs, movement is the transfer
of processing, interactions are processing overloads and the fields of physics
are network properties. It has no empty space, no singularities and all the
conservations of physics just conserve processing. Its prediction, that the
collision of high frequency light in a vacuum can create permanent matter, will
test it. If the physical world has the properties of a processing output,
physics must rewrite the story behind its equations.

  symmetric functions",,,,,"math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let A be an associative algebra (or any other kind of algebra for that
matter). A derivation on A is an endomorphism \del of the underlying Abelian
group of A such that \del(ab)=a(\del b)+(\del a)b for all a,b\in A (1.1)
  A Hasse-Schmidt derivation is a sequence (d_0=id,d_1,d_2,...,d_n,...) of
endomorphisms of the underlying Abelian group such that for all n \ge 1
d_n(ab)= \sum_{i=0}^n (d_ia)(d_{n-i}b) (1.2)
  Note that d_1 is a derivation as defined by (1.1). The individual d_n that
occur in a Hasse-Schmidt derivation are also sometimes called higher
derivations. A question of some importance is whether Hasse-Schmidt derivations
can be written down in terms of polynomials in ordinary derivations. For
instance in connection with automatic continuity for Hasse-Schmidt derivations
on Banach algebras. Such formulas have been written down by, for instance,
Heerema and Mirzavaziri in [5] and [6]. They also will be explicitly given
below. It is the purpose of this short note to show that such formulas follow
directly from some easy results about the Hopf algebra NSymm of non-commutative
symmetric functions. In fact this Hopf algebra constitutes a universal example
concerning the matter.

new type of impulsive differential equations recently introduced. The main
result is a fishing effort threshold which determines either the sustainability
of the fishery or the extinction of the resource.
