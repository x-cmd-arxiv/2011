carry out this research we observed the SNR G338.3-0.0 using the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 235, 610, and 1280 MHz. We also reprocessed
archival data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 1290 and
2300 MHz. Also we conducted a search for radio pulsations towards a central
point-like source, using the GMRT antennas at 610 and 1280 MHz. The molecular
material in the region of the SNR was investigated based on observations made
with the NANTEN telescope in the 12^CO (J=1-0) emission line. The new radio
observations revealed a remnant with a bilateral morphology, which at 235 MHz
has the western wing completely attenuated because of absorption due to
foreground ionized gas. The quality of the new images allows us to provide
accurate estimates for the total radio flux density of the whole SNR at
different radio frequencies. From the new and existing flux density estimates
between 235 and 5000 MHz we derived for the whole remnant a spectral index
alpha=-0.51 +/-0.06 with a local free-free continuum optical depth at 235 MHz
tau_{235}=0.9+/-0.3. No radio pulsations were detected towards the only radio
point-like source within the HESS error circle. We derived upper limits of 2.0

source. No radio counterpart was found for the pulsar wind nebula discovered in

unique system with moving emission lines in the spectrum. The orbital
inclination is known from spectroscopic observations of moving lines; the
distance is derived from radio interferometry of relativistic jets; the mass
ratio of its components is determined from X-ray observations of jets'
eclipses. In 2005, the accretion donor was detected as an A4 - A8 giant, and
its contribution to eclipse light was measured spectroscopically. In the
present paper, the A-type star was detected via multicolor photometry on the
basis of its Balmer jump. A method is proposed to estimate the interstellar
reddening, able to measure the individual law of interstellar absorption for SS
433 from spectrophotometry. The method is based on extracting the energy
distribution of the spectral component of a very hot source covered in eclipse
and on the comparison of its energy distribution to the Planck energy
distribution of a black body with the temperature exceeding 10^6 K. The
determination of general parameters of SS 433 leads to fairly accurate
estimates of luminosity, radius, and mass of the A star in the system, and
consequently leads to an accurate estimate of the mass of the compact
component, the source of jets. The latter mass is between 1.25 and 1.87 solar
masses. The reasons for overestimating this mass when using the dynamical
method are discussed. In our opinion, the presence of a black hole in this

objects (S5 1803+784, PKS 0735+178, etc.) have revealed a new paradigm for the
pc-scale jet kinematics of these sources. Unlike the apparent superluminal
outward motions usually observed in blazars, most, if not all, jet components
in these sources appear to be stationary with respect to the core, while
exhibiting strong changes in their position angles. As a result, the jet ridge
lines of these sources evolve substantially, at times forming a wide
channel-flow. We investigate the Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum (CJF)
sample of radio-loud active galaxies to study this new kinematic scenario for
flat-spectrum AGN. We develop a number of tools that extract information about
the apparent linear and angular evolution of the CJF jet ridge lines, as well
as their morphology. In this way, we study both radial and non-radial apparent
motions in the CJF jets. We find that approximately half of the sample shows
appreciable apparent jet widths ($>10 degrees$), with BL Lac jet ridge lines
showing significantly larger apparent widths than both quasars and radio
galaxies. In addition, BL Lac jet ridge lines are found to change their
apparent width more strongly. Finally, BL Lac jet ridge lines show the least
apparent linear evolution, which translates to the smallest apparent expansion
speeds for their components. We find compelling evidence supporting a
substantially different kinematic scenario for flat-spectrum radio-AGN jets and
in particular for BL Lac objects. In addition, we find that variability is
closely related to the properties of a source's jet ridge line. Variable
quasars are found to show ""BL Lac like"" behavior, compared to their
non-variable counterparts.

and the polarity of dust ion acoustic solitary structures in an unmagnetized
collisionless nonthermal dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged static
dust grains, adiabatic warm ions and nonthermal electrons when the velocity of
the wave frame is equal to the linearized velocity of the dust ion acoustic
wave for long wave length plane wave perturbation, i.e., when the velocity of
the solitary structure is equal to the acoustic speed. A compositional
parameter space has been drawn which shows the nature of existence and the
polarity of dust ion acoustic solitary structures at the acoustic speed. This
compositional parameter space clearly indicates the regions for the existence
of positive and negative potential dust ion acoustic solitary structures.
Again, this compositional parameter space shows that the present system
supports the negative potential double layer at the acoustic speed along a
particular curve in the parametric plane. However, the negative potential
double layer is unable to restrict the occurrence of all negative potential
solitary waves. As a result, in a particular region of the parameter space,
there exist negative potential solitary waves after the formation of negative
potential double layer. But the amplitudes of these supersolitons are bounded.
A finite jump between amplitudes of negative potential solitons separated by
the negative potential double layer has been observed, and consequently, the
present system supports the supersolitons at the acoustic speed in a
neighbourhood of the curve along which negative potential double layer exist.
The effects of the parameters on the amplitude of the solitary structures at
the acoustic speed have been discussed.

properties like temperature and entropy and perform a model-independent

to make the first collider analysis of classicalization. In the model for

get spectacular multi-W/Z final states that decay into leptons, missing energy

Our sample can be divided into two types of objects: young isolated, embedded

and more evolved objects that are dominated by extended emission from
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pure H2 rotational lines. We are
able to constrain the illuminating FUV fields by classifying the PAH bands
below 9micron. For most of the sources we are able to detect several atomic
fine structure lines. In particular, the [NeII] line appearing in two regions
could originate from unresolved photodissociation regions (PDRs) or J-shocks.
We relate the identified spectral features to observations obtained from NIR
through submillimeter imaging. The spatial extent of several H2 and PAH bands
is matched with morphologies identified in previous Spitzer/IRAC observations.
This also allows us to distinguish between the different H2 excitation
mechanisms. In addition, we calculate the optical extinction from the silicate
bands and use this to constrain the spectral energy distribution fit, allowing

in which the metric is coupled to a scalar field, resulting in modified
Einstein field equations. In the dynamical theory, the scalar field is itself
sourced by the Pontryagin density of the space-time. In this paper, the coupled
system of equations for the metric and the scalar field is solved numerically
for slowly-rotating neutron stars described with realistic equations of state
and for slowly-rotating black holes. An analytic solution for a
constant-density nonrelativistic object is also presented. It is shown that the
black hole solution cannot be used to describe the exterior spacetime of a star
as was previously assumed. In addition, whereas previous analysis were limited
to the small-coupling regime, this paper considers arbitrarily large coupling
strengths. It is found that the CS modification leads to two effects on the
gravitomagnetic sector of the metric: (i) Near the surface of a star or the
horizon of a black hole, the magnitude of the gravitomagnetic potential is
decreased and frame-dragging effects are reduced in comparison to GR. (ii) In
the case of a star, the angular momentum J, as measured by distant observers,
is enhanced in CS gravity as compared to standard GR. For a large coupling
strength, the near-zone frame-dragging effects become significantly screened,
whereas the far-zone enhancement saturate at a maximum value max(Delta J) ~
(M/R) J. Using measurements of frame-dragging effects around the Earth by
Gravity Probe B and the LAGEOS satellites, a weak but robust constraint is set

through strong lensing of background galaxies in which the positions of
multiple images of the same source constrain the surface mass distribution of
the cluster. However, current parametrized mass models can often only reproduce
the observed positions to within one or a few arcsec which is worse than the
positional measurement uncertainty. One suggested explanation for this
discrepancy is the additional perturbations of the path of the light ray caused
by matter density fluctuations along the line of sight. We investigate this by
calculating the statistical expectation value for the angular deflections
caused by density fluctuations, which can be done given the matter power
spectrum. We find that density fluctuations can, indeed, produce deflections of
a few arcsec. We also find that the deflection angle of a particular image is
expected to increase with source redshift and with the angular distance on the
sky to the lens. Since the light rays of neighbouring images pass through much
the same density fluctuations, it turns out that the images' expected
deflection angles can be highly correlated. This implies that line-of-sight
density fluctuations are a significant and possibly dominant systematic for
strong lensing mass modeling and set a lower limit to how well a cluster mass
model can be expected to replicate the observed image positions. We discuss how
the deflections and correlations should explicitly be taken into account in the
mass model fitting procedure.

jet observables where the soft and collinear dynamics of QCD dominate. A
necessary condition for factorization is that the phase space constraints on
soft and collinear dynamics for a given observable are independent of each

place strong constraints on the form of jet substructure methods that can
factorize. We illustrate this approach by considering four substructure

not differentiate between elements of ultrarelativistic rigidity. By
considering an initial (injection-) phase of the diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA), where elemental similarity does not apply, we demonstrate that the
spectral difference is, in fact, a unique signature of the DSA. Collisionless
plasma SNR shocks inject more He2+ relative to protons when they are stronger
and so produce harder helium spectra. The injection bias is due to Alfven waves
driven by the more abundant protons, so the He2+ ions are harder to trap by
these waves because of the larger gyroradii. By fitting the p/He ratio to the

analysis. Although the star does display a radial velocity signal at the period
of the planet, this has been difficult to disentangle from the intrinsic
stellar variability, and pinning down the velocity amplitude has been very
challenging. As a result, the precise value of the mass of the planet - and
even the extent to which it can be considered to be confirmed - have been
debated in the recent literature, with six mass measurements published so far
based on the same spectroscopic observations, ranging from about 2 to 8 Earth
masses. Here we report on an independent validation of the planet discovery,
using one of the fundamental properties of a transit signal: its achromaticity.
We observed four transits of CoRoT-7 b with Spitzer, in order to determine
whether the depth of the transit signal in the near-infrared is consistent with

transit and found an average depth of 0.426 {\pm} 0.115 mmag at 4.5 {\mu}m,
which is in good agreement with the depth of 0.350 {\pm} 0.011 mmag found by
CoRoT. These observations place important constraints on the kinds of
astrophysical false positives that could mimic the signal. Combining this with
additional constraints reported earlier, we performed an exhaustive exploration
of possible blends scenarios for CoRoT-7 b using the BLENDER technique. We are
able to rule out the vast majority of false positives, and the remaining ones
are found to be much less likely than a true transiting planet. We thus
validate CoRoT-7 b as a bona-fide planet with a very high degree of confidence,
independently of any radial-velocity information. Our Spitzer observations have
additionally allowed us to significantly improve the ephemeris of the planet.

consisting of a uniform disk and a Gaussian disk, to obtain characteristic
angular sizes of the central stellar sources and their dust envelopes, as well
as the flux ratios between these components. Angular uniform disk diameters of
the three central components of the objects above have values between 3.2 mas
and 5.4 mas. For their dust envelopes, we find FWHM values between 17.1 mas and
25.2 mas. According to distance estimates from the literature, the central
stellar components have radii between 900 R_sun and 1400 R_sun, while their
dust envelopes reach FWHM values between 9000 R_sun and 13000 R_sun. The
visibility functions of all three sources exhibit wavelength variations that
resemble those of earlier VLTI/AMBER observations of semi-regular and Mira
variable AGB stars. These are interpreted as characteristic of atmospheric
molecular layers lying above the photosphere. We also find that the dust
envelopes have a clearly larger optical depth than those known for Mira stars.
We interpret this as an expected result of the ""superwind"" phase, the final 10
000 to 30 000 years of AGB-evolution, when the mass-loss rate increases by a

sigma) variation in ~30% of the quasars overall; the fraction of sources with
detected variability increases strongly with the number of available source
counts up to ~70% for sources with >1000 counts per epoch. Assuming the
distribution of fractional variation is Gaussian, its standard deviation is
~16% on >1 week time scales, which is not enough to explain the observed
scatter in quasar X-ray-to-optical flux ratios as due to variability alone. We
find no evidence in our sample that quasars are more variable at higher
redshifts (z > 2), as has been suggested in previous studies. Quasar X-ray
spectra vary similarly to some local Seyfert AGN in that they steepen as they
brighten, with evidence for a constant, hard spectral component that is more
prominent in fainter stages. We identify one highly-variable Narrow Line
Seyfert 1-type spectroscopic quasar in the Chandra Deep Field-North. We
constrain the rate of kilosecond-timescale flares in the quasar population

variation amplitudes between exposures; extreme changes (>100%) are quite rare,

convective motions in sub-photospheric layers. This scenario opens the door for
a natural explanation of the well established correlation between bolometric

situations but, in abrupt transitions such as during an economical crisis, the
random walk model fails and alternative descriptions are needed. For this
reason, several proposals have been recently forwarded which are based on the
formalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper we apply the 'SCoP formalism',
elaborated to provide an operational foundation of quantum mechanics, to the
stock market. We argue that a stock market is an intrinsically contextual
system where agents' decisions globally influence the market system and stocks
prices, determining a nonclassical behavior. More specifically, we maintain
that a given stock does not generally have a definite value, e.g., a price, but
its value is actualized as a consequence of the contextual interactions in the
trading process. This contextual influence is responsible of the
non-Kolmogorovian quantum-like behavior of the market at a statistical level.
Then, we propose a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement formalism'
that describes a buying/selling process of a stock and shows that it is
intuitively reasonable to assume that the stock has not a definite price until
it is traded. This result is relevant in our opinion since it provides a
theoretical support to the use of quantum models in finance.

is physically impossible to counterfeit, something that cannot be done in the
classical world. However, Wiesner's scheme required a central bank to verify
the money, and the question of whether there can be unclonable quantum money
that anyone can verify has remained open since. One can also ask a related
question, which seems to be new: can quantum states be used as copy-protected
programs, which let the user evaluate some function f, but not create more
programs for f? This paper tackles both questions using the arsenal of modern
computational complexity. Our main result is that there exist quantum oracles
relative to which publicly-verifiable quantum money is possible, and any family
of functions that cannot be efficiently learned from its input-output behavior
can be quantumly copy-protected. This provides the first formal evidence that
these tasks are achievable. The technical core of our result is a
""Complexity-Theoretic No-Cloning Theorem,"" which generalizes both the standard
No-Cloning Theorem and the optimality of Grover search, and might be of
independent interest. Our security argument also requires explicit
constructions of quantum t-designs. Moving beyond the oracle world, we also
present an explicit candidate scheme for publicly-verifiable quantum money,

copy-protecting the family of point functions. We do not know how to base the
security of these schemes on any existing cryptographic assumption. (Note that
without an oracle, we can only hope for security under some computational

that the mass flux in each zone must satisfy Mdot ~ R^n with n=1, in contrast
to previous work in which 0<n< 1 is a free parameter but in rough agreement
with numerical simulations. We also demonstrate that the resulting two-zone
ADIOS models are not dynamically self-consistent without the introduction of an
energy source close in to the central regions of the flow; we identify this
with the energy liberated by accretion. We explore the parameter space of
non-radiative models and show that both powerful winds and gentle breezes are
possible. When small radiative losses (with fixed efficiency) are included, any
centrally injected energy flux is radiated away and the system reverts to a
power-law behavior with n < 1, where n falls in a small range determined by the
fractional level of radiative losses. We also present an ADIOS model for
hypercritical (super-Eddington) disk accretion, in which the radiative losses

the dissolution time-scale of the cluster in our simulations is mainly
determined by the tidal forcing along the orbit and, for a given tidal forcing,

the largest (aperture 4 m) wide field of view (FOV) telescope and is equipped
with the largest amount (4000) of optical fibres in the world. For the LAMOST
North and the LAMOST South the FOV are 5 deg and 3.5 deg, the linear diameters
are 1.75 m and 1.22 m, respectively. A new kind of atmospheric dispersion
corrector (ADC) is put forward and designed for LAMOST. It is a segmented lens
which consists of many lens--prism strips. Although it is very big, its
thickness is only 12 mm. Thus the difficulty of obtaining big optical glass is
avoided, and the aberration caused by the ADC is small. Moving this segmented
lens along the optical axis, the different dispersions can be obtained. The
effects of ADC's slits on the diffraction energy distribution and on the
obstruction of light are discussed. The aberration caused by ADC is calculated
and discussed. All these results are acceptable. Such an ADC could also be used
for other optical fibre spectroscopic telescopes, especially those which a have
very large FOV.

increasing attentions from various research disciplines. Most previous works,
however, focus only on the dynamic behaviors of synchronization process in the
stable region, i.e., global synchronization. In this letter, we demonstrate
that synchronization process on complex networks can efficiently reveal the
substructures of networks when the coupling strength of chaotic oscillators is
under the lower boundary of stable region. Both analytic and numerical results
show that the nodes belonging to the same component in the hierarchical network
are tightly clustered according to the Euclidean distances between the state
vectors of the corresponding oscillators, and different levels of hierarchy can
be systematically unfolded by gradually tuning the coupling strength. When the
coupling strengths exceed the upper boundary of stable region, the hierarchy of
the network cannot be recognized by this approach. Extensive simulations
suggest that our method may provide a powerful tool to detect the hierarchical
community structure of complex systems and deep insight into the relationship
between structure and dynamics of complex systems.

centrality, to determine the relative importance of a species in an ecosystem
network with respect to ecosystem energy--matter exchange. We demonstrate the
uniqueness of environ centrality by comparing it to other common centrality
metrics and then show its ecological significance. Specifically, we tested two
hypotheses on a set of 50 empirically-based ecosystem network models. The first
concerned the distribution of centrality in the community. We hypothesized that
the functional importance of species would tend to be concentrated into a few
dominant species followed by a group of species with lower, more even
importance as is often seen in dominance--diversity curves. Second, we tested
the systems ecology hypothesis that indirect relationships homogenize the
functional importance of species in ecosystems. Our results support both
hypotheses and highlight the importance of detritus and nutrient recyclers such
as fungi and bacteria in generating the energy--matter flow in ecosystems. Our
homogenization results suggest that indirect effects are important in part
because they tend to even the importance of species in ecosystems. A core
contribution of this work is that it creates a formal, mathematical method to
quantify the importance species play in generating ecosystem activity by
integrating direct, indirect, and boundary effects in ecological systems.

would be regarded as compelling evidence for inflation. The canonical measure
of this is the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r. For single-field
slow-roll models of inflation with small field excursions, the Lyth bound
dictates that if the evolution of the slow-roll parameter epsilon is monotonic,
the tensor-to-scalar ratio must be below observationally detectable levels. We
describe how non-monotonic evolution of epsilon can evade the Lyth bound and
generate observationally large r, even with small field excursions. This has
consequences for the scalar power spectrum as it necessarily predicts an
enhancement in the spectrum at very small scales and significant
scale-dependent running at CMB scales. This effect has not been appropriately
accounted for in previous analyses. We describe a mechanism that will
generically produce the required behaviour in epsilon and give an example of
this mechanism arising in a well-motivated small-field model. This model can
produce r\geq0.05 while satisfying all current observational constraints.

neutrino oscillations, but only if one goes beyond the standard 3 family
scenario. Recently a different explanation of the events has been given, not in
terms of oscillations but by the production and decay of a massive sterile
neutrino with large transition magnetic moment. We study the effect of such a
sterile neutrino in the rare decays $\tau^- \rightarrow \mu^- \mu^+ \pi^- \nu$
and $\tau^{-}\rightarrow \mu^{-} \mu^{+} e^{-} \nu \nu$. We find that searches
for these decays featuring displaced vertices between the $\mu^-$ and the other
charged particles, constitute good tests for the existence of the sterile
neutrino proposed to explain the MiniBooNE anomaly. These searches could be
done with already existing experimental data.

discuss the $\gamma$-ray emission process within the context of the outer gap

accelerator controlled by the magnetic pair-creation process is preferable in
explaining the possible correlation between the $\gamma$-ray luminosity and the
spin down power. Our Monte-Calro simulation implies that most of the
$\gamma$-ray emitting MSPs are radio quiet in the present sensitivity of the
radio survey, indicating that most of the $\gamma$-ray MSPs have been
unidentified. We argue that the Galactic $Fermi$ unidentified sources located
at high latitudes should be dominated by MSPs, whereas the sources in the
galactic plane are dominated by radio-quiet canonical pulsars.

beams of light which have linked and knotted field lines. The preservation of
the topological structure of the field lines in these solutions has previously
been ascribed to the fact that the electric and magnetic helicity, a measure of
the degree of linking and knotting between field lines, are conserved. Here we
show that the elegant evolution of the field is due to the stricter condition
that the electric and magnetic fields be everywhere orthogonal. The field lines
then satisfy a `frozen field' condition and evolve as if they were unbreakable
filaments embedded in a fluid. The preservation of the orthogonality of the
electric and magnetic field lines is guaranteed for null, shear-free fields
such as the ones considered here by a theorem of Robinson. We calculate the
flow field of a particular solution and find it to have the form of a Hopf
fibration moving at the speed of light in a direction opposite to the
propagation of the pulsed light beam, a familiar structure in this type of
solution. The difference between smooth evolution of individual field lines and
conservation of electric and magnetic helicity is illustrated by considering a
further example in which the helicities are conserved, but the field lines are
not everywhere orthogonal. The field line configuration at time t=0 corresponds
to a nested family of torus knots but unravels upon evolution.

and mesoscopic numerical simulations, we estimate the threshold flux for the
translocation of chains of different number of monomers. The translocation of
the chains is controlled by the competition between entropic and hydrodynamic
effects, which set a critical penetration length for the chain before it can
translocate through the channel. We demonstrate that the polymers show two
different translocation regimes depending on how their length under confinement
compares to the critical penetration length. For polymer chains longer than the
threshold, the translocation process is insensitive to the number of monomers
in the chain as predicted in Sakaue {\it et al.}, {\it Euro. Phys. Lett.}, {\bf
72} 83 (2005). However, for chains shorter than the critical length we show
that the translocation process is strongly dependent on the length of the
chain. We discuss the possible relevance of our results to biological
transport.

analyzing the quality of self-emerging solutions in weighted congestion games.
With respect to traditional combinatorial approaches, the primal-dual schema
has at least three advantages: first, it provides an analytic tool which can
always be used to prove tight upper bounds for all the cases in which we are
able to characterize exactly the polyhedron of the solutions under analysis;
secondly, in each such a case the complementary slackness conditions give us an
hint on how to construct matching lower bounding instances; thirdly, proofs
become simpler and easy to check. For the sake of exposition, we first apply
our technique to the problems of bounding the prices of anarchy and stability
of exact and approximate pure Nash equilibria, as well as the approximation
ratio of the solutions achieved after a one-round walk starting from the empty
strategy profile, in the case of affine latency functions and we show how all
the known upper bounds for these measures (and some of their generalizations)
can be easily reobtained under a unified approach. Then, we use the technique
to attack the more challenging setting of polynomial latency functions. In
particular, we obtain the first known upper bounds on the price of stability of
pure Nash equilibria and on the approximation ratio of the solutions achieved
after a one-round walk starting from the empty strategy profile for unweighted
players in the cases of quadratic and cubic latency functions. We believe that
our technique, thanks to its versatility, may prove to be a powerful tool also
in several other applications.

of the classical Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice, we propose a specific
chiral spin liquid that reconciles different, well-established results
concerning both the classical and quantum models. This proposal is analyzed in
an extended mean-field Schwinger boson framework encompassing time reversal
symmetry breaking phases which allows both a classical and a quantum phase
description. At low temperatures, we find quantum fluctuations favor this
chiral phase, which is stable against small perturbations of second and third
neighbor interactions. For spin-1/2 this phase may be, beyond mean-field, a
chiral gapped spin liquid. Such a phase is consistent with Density Matrix
Renormalization Group results of Yan et al. (Science 322, 1173 (2011)).
Mysterious features of the low lying excitations of exact diagonalization
spectra also find an explanation in this framework. Moreover, thermal
fluctuations compete with quantum ones and induce a transition from this flux
phase to a planar zero flux phase at a non zero value of the renormalized
temperature (T/S^2), reconciling these results with those obtained for the
classical system.

Mecke transformed his construction into a continuous-time model. He put forward

of Kepler-17b, recently announced by Desert et al. 2011. Radial-velocity
measurements, taken with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the OHP, and Kepler
photometry (Q1 and Q2 data) were used to derive the orbital, stellar and
planetary parameters. KOI-135b and KOI-204b orbit their parent stars in 3.02
and 3.25 days, respectively. They have approximately the same radius,
Rp=1.20+/-0.06 R_jup and 1.24+/-0.07 R_jup, but different masses Mp=3.23+/-0.19
M_jup and 1.02+/-0.07 M_jup. As a consequence, their bulk densities differ by a
factor of four, rho_p=2.33+/-0.36 g.cm^-3 (KOI-135b) and 0.65+/-0.12 g.cm-3
(KOI-204b). Our SOPHIE spectra of Kepler-17b, used both to measure the
radial-velocity variations and determine the atmospheric parameters of the host
star, allow us to refine the characterisation of the planetary system. In
particular we found the radial-velocity semi-amplitude and the stellar mass to
be respectively slightly smaller and larger than Desert et al. These two
quantities, however, compensate and lead to a planetary mass fully consistent
with Desert et al.: our analysis gives Mp=2.47+/-0.10 M_jup and Rp=1.33+/-0.04
R_jup. We found evidence for a younger age of this planetary system, t<1.8 Gyr,
which is supported by both evolutionary tracks and gyrochronology. Finally, we
confirm the detection of the optical secondary eclipse and found also the
brightness phase variation with the Q1 and Q2 Kepler data. The latter indicates
a low redistribution of stellar heat to the night side (<16% at 1-sigma), if
the optical planetary occultation comes entirely from thermal flux. The
geometric albedo is A_g<0.12 (1-sigma).

present a new fraction-free algorithm for the computation of a diagonal form of
a matrix over a certain non-commutative Euclidean domain over a computable
field with the help of Gr\""obner bases. This algorithm is formulated in a
general constructive framework of non-commutative Ore localizations of
$G$-algebras (OLGAs). We split the computation of a normal form of a matrix
into the diagonalization and the normalization processes. Both of them can be
made fraction-free. For a matrix $M$ over an OLGA we provide a diagonalization
algorithm to compute $U,V$ and $D$ with fraction-free entries such that $UMV=D$
holds and $D$ is diagonal. The fraction-free approach gives us more information
on the system of linear functional equations and its solutions, than the
classical setup of an operator algebra with rational functions coefficients. In
particular, one can handle distributional solutions together with, say,
meromorphic ones. We investigate Ore localizations of common operator algebras
over $K[x]$ and use them in the unimodularity analysis of transformation
matrices $U,V$. In turn, this allows to lift the isomorphism of modules over an
OLGA Euclidean domain to a polynomial subring of it. We discuss the relation of
this lifting with the solutions of the original system of equations. Moreover,
we prove some new results concerning normal forms of matrices over non-simple
domains. Our implementation in the computer algebra system {\sc
Singular:Plural} follows the fraction-free strategy and shows impressive
performance, compared with methods which directly use fractions. Since we
experience moderate swell of coefficients and obtain simple transformation
matrices, the method we propose is well suited for solving nontrivial practical

cell exposed to a traveling wave of the chemoattractant. The model incorporates
two types of responses to stimulation by the chemoattractant, i.e., change in
polarity and change in motility of the cell. The periodic change in motility is
assumed to be induced by the periodic stimulation by the chemoattractant on the
basis of previous observations. Consequently, net migration of the cell occurs
in a particular direction with respect to wave propagation, which explains the
migration of Dictyostelium cells in aggregation processes. The difference
between two time delays from the stimulation to the two responses and the wave
frequency determined by the frequency of the secretion of the chemoattractant
are important parameters that determine the direction of migration and the
effective interaction between cells in a population. This result explains the
dispersed state of a population of vegetative cells and cells in preaggregation
without the assumption of a chemorepellent, and also explains the commencement
of the aggregation. The result is extended to a general fact as follows: the
temporal oscillation of the magnitude of the random motion for gradient-sensing
particles induces spontaneous movement, even when the particles are exposed to
a periodic wave of the chemoattractant, which results in the aggregation or
dispersion of the particles communicating via their attractant.

  Four distinct classes of wind-ISM interaction (i.e. ""fermata"", ""eyes"",

morphology are discussed. We detect bow shocks for ~40% of the sample and
detached rings for ~20%. De-projected stand-off distances (R_0) -- defined as
the distance between the central star and the nearest point of the interaction
region -- of the detected bow shocks (""fermata"" and ""eyes"") are derived from
the PACS images and compared to previous results, model predictions and the
simulations. All observed bow shocks have stand-off distances smaller than 1
pc. Observed and theoretical stand-off distances are used together to
independently derive the local ISM density.
  Both theoretical (analytical) models and hydrodynamical simulations give
stand-off distances for adopted stellar properties that are in good agreement
with the measured de-projected stand-off distance of wind-ISM bow shocks. The
possible detection of a bow shock -- for the distance limited sample -- appears
to be governed by its physical size as set roughly by the stand-off distance.
In particular the star's peculiar space velocity and the density of the ISM
appear decisive in detecting emission from bow shocks or detached rings.
Tentatively, the ""eyes"" class objects are associated to (visual) binaries,

(OM-reversibility) in Markov chains that are parametrized by a positive
parameter $\ep$. OM-reversibility is a weaker condition than reversibility, and
requires only the knowledge of order of magnitude of the transition
probabilities. For an irreducible, OM-reversible Markov chain on a finite state
space, we prove that the stationary distribution satisfies order of magnitude
detailed balance (analog of detailed balance in reversible Markov chains). The
result characterizes the states with positive probability in the limit of the
stationary distribution as $\ep \to 0$, which finds an important application in
the case of singularly perturbed Markov chains that are reducible for $\ep=0$.
We show that OM-reversibility occurs naturally in macroscopic systems,
involving many interacting particles. Clustering is a common phenomenon in
biological systems, in which particles or molecules aggregate at one location.
We give a simple condition on the transition probabilities in an interacting
particle Markov chain that characterizes clustering. We show that such
clustering processes are OM-reversible, and we find explicitly the order of
magnitude of the stationary distribution. Further, we show that the single pole
states, in which all particles are at a single vertex, are the only states with
positive probability in the limit of the stationary distribution as the rate of
diffusion goes to zero.

the width of the hydrophilic stripes. We compare the growth of the film on the

from Keck imaging and spectroscopy, as well as from HST/WFC3 imaging in the

the third is a QSO+galaxy pair. The velocity dispersion of the host galaxies,

metallicities and star-formation rates from host galaxies with active star
formation. From a final sample of ~ 40 emission-line galaxies, we find that
light-curve corrected Type Ia supernovae are ~ 0.1 magnitudes brighter in
high-metallicity hosts than in low-metallicity hosts. We also find a

Euler characteristic used in earlier analyses of cosmological models. The
richer information content of Betti numbers goes along with the availability of
fast algorithms to compute them. When measured as a function of scale they
provide a ""Betti signature"" for a point distribution that is a sensitive yet
robust discriminator of structure. The signature is highly effective in
revealing differences in structure arising in different cosmological models,
and is exploited towards distinguishing between different dark energy models

between the renormalized bands can be identified as the long-sought 'hidden'
order parameter. We report on the measurement of a hybridization gap in URu2Si2
employing a spectroscopic technique based on quasiparticle scattering across a
ballistic metallic junction. The differential conductance exhibits an
asymmetric double-peak structure, a clear signature for a Fano resonance in a
Kondo lattice. The extracted hybridization gap opens well above the transition
temperature, indicating that it is not the hidden order parameter. Our results
put stringent constraints on the origin of the hidden order transition in
URu2Si2 and demonstrate that quasiparticle scattering spectroscopy can probe
the band renormalizations in a Kondo lattice via detection of a novel type of

generalize the theory of Tannaka duality in two ways: first, we replace Hopf
algebras with weak Hopf algebras and strong monoidal functors with separable
Frobenius monoidal functors; second, we replace the category of vector spaces
with an arbitrary braided monoidal category. To accomplish this goal, we
introduce a new graphical notation for functors between monoidal categories,
using string diagrams with coloured regions. Not only does this notation extend
our capacity to give simple proofs of complicated calculations, it makes plain
some of the connections between Frobenius monoidal or separable Frobenius
monoidal functors and the topology of the axioms defining certain algebraic
structures. Finally, having generalized Tannaka to an arbitrary base category,
we briefly discuss the functoriality of the construction as this base is
varied.

superconducting transition of T_c \simeq 25 K. In order to elucidate the nature
of the superconducting state we have performed a low-energy muSR study. By
applying a magnetic field parallel (Meissner state) and perpendicular (vortex
state) to the film planes, we could show that superconductivity is sheet like,
resulting in a very anisotropic superconducting state. This result is
consistent with a simple charge-transfer model, which takes into account the
layered structure and the difference in the chemical potential between LCO and
LSCO, as well as Sr interdiffusion. Using a pancake-vortex model we could
estimate a strict upper limit of the London penetration depth to 380 nm in
these superlattices. The temperature dependence of the muon depolarization rate
in field cooling experiments is very similar to what is observed in
intercalated BSCCO and suggests that vortex-vortex interaction is dominated by
electromagnetic coupling but negligible Josephson interaction.

incompatibility between some fundamental interactions and the underlying
lattice geometry1-7. Geometric frustration gives rise to new fundamental
phenomena and is known to yield intriguing effects, such as the formation of
exotic states like spin ice, spin liquids and spin glasses1-7. It has also led
to interesting findings of fractional charge quantization and magnetic
monopoles5,6. Geometric frustration related mechanisms have been proposed to
understand the origins of relaxor behavior in some multiferroics, colossal
magnetocapacitive coupling and unusual and novel mechanisms of high Tc
superconductivity1-5. Although geometric frustration has been particularly well
studied in magnetic systems in the last 20 years or so, its manifestation in
the important class formed by ferroelectric materials (that are compounds
exhibiting electric rather than magnetic dipoles) is basically unknown. Here,
we show, via the use of a first-principles-based technique, that
compositionally graded ferroelectrics possess the characteristic ""fingerprints""
associated with geometric frustration. These systems have a highly degenerate
energy surface and exhibit original critical phenomena. They further reveal
exotic orderings with novel stripe phases involving complex spatial
organization. These stripes display spiral states, topological defects and
curvature. Compositionally graded ferroelectrics can thus be considered as the
""missing"" link that brings ferroelectrics into the broad category of materials
able to exhibit geometric frustration. Our ab-initio calculations allow a deep
microscopic insight into this novel geometrically frustrated system.

questions of principle since the usual minimal coupling obtained by replacing
ordinary derivatives with covariant derivatives is not available -- they are
the same operation on scalar fields. Conformal couplings in the Lagrangian
proportional to $\phi^2 R$ have been suggested before, usually to maintain
conformal invariance for massless scalar fields, but at the cost of breaking
the equivalence principle. Here we give intuitive arguments for the appearance
of such a term due to fluctuations of scalar particles about their classical
world lines. Remarkably, these arguments give precisely a correction of the
form required to maintain conformal invariance. We also show that such a term
would naturally be expected for the Higgs field in the Standard Model, making a
perhaps surprising connection between weak-scale physics and gravity. The
nonminimal coupling, whether induced by quantum corrections or already present
as a bare term, can be constrained from measurements of the Higgs width
assuming the Higgs particle is to be detected.

equations. These two forms correspond to two different definitions of
trigonometric functions, one geometrical using right triangles and unit
circles, and the other employing differential equations. Although the two
definitions must be equivalent, this equivalence is not demonstrated in
textbooks. In this manuscript, the equivalence between the geometrical and the
differential definition is presented assuming no a priori knowledge of the
properties of sine and cosine functions. We start with the usual length
projections on the unit circle and use elementary geometry and elementary
calculus to arrive to harmonic differential equations. This more general and
abstract treatment not only reveals the equivalence of the two definitions but
also provides an instructive perspective on circular and harmonic motion as
studied in kinematics. This exercise can help develop an appreciation of
