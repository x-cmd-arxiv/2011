detectors are totally active, segmented, liquid scintillator detectors and are
located 14 mrad off the NuMI beam axis. The Far Detector has begun construction
and will begin taking data in early 2013. The experiment aims to measure the
neutrino mixing angle theta_13 and will push the search for electron neutrino
appearance beyond the current limits by more than an order of magnitude. For
non-zero theta_13, it is possible for NOvA to observe CP violation in neutrinos
and establish the neutrino mass hierarchy. The NOvA prototype near detector on
the surface (NDOS) began running at Fermilab in November and registered its
first neutrinos from the NuMI beam in December 2010. An overview and current

classes of two-user state-dependent discrete memoryless broadcast channels,

comprises a sender broadcasting two independent messages to two non-cooperating
receivers; for channels of the second class, each receiver is given the message
it need not decode; and the third class comprises channels where the sender is
constrained to keep each message confidential from the unintended receiver. We
derive inner bounds for all the three classes of channels. For the first and
second class of channels, we discuss the rate penalty on the achievable region
for having to deal with side-information. For channels of third class, we
characterize the rate penalties for having to deal not only with
side-information, but also to satisfy confidentiality constraints. We then
derive outer bounds, where we present an explicit characterization of sum-rate
bounds for the first and third class of channels. For channels of the second
class, we show that our outer bounds are within a fixed gap away from the
achievable rate region, where the gap is independent of the distribution
characterizing this class of channels. The channel models presented in this

records is applied to Lagrangian trajectories from a numerical model of eddies
generated by an unstable equivalent barotropic jet on a beta plane. An
oscillation in a Lagrangian trajectory is represented mathematically as the
signal traced out as a particle orbits a time-varying ellipse, a model which
captures wavelike motions as well as the displacement signal of a particle
trapped in an evolving vortex. Such oscillatory features can be separated from
the turbulent background flow through an analysis founded upon a complex-valued
wavelet transform of the trajectory. Application of the method to a set of one
hundred modeled trajectories shows that the oscillatory motions of Lagrangian
particles orbiting vortex cores appear to be extracted very well by the method,
which depends upon only a handful of free parameters and which requires no
operator intervention. Furthermore, vortex motions are clearly distinguished
from wavelike meandering of the jet---the former are high frequency, nearly
circular signals, while the latter are linear in polarization and at much lower
frequencies. This suggests that the proposed method can be useful for
identifying and studying vortex and wave properties in large Lagrangian
datasets. In particular, the eccentricity of the oscillatory displacement
signals, a quantity which is not normally considered in Lagrangian studies,
emerges as an informative diagnostic for characterizing qualitatively different
types of motion.

recover results obtained previously. The 2-d solution obtained here also solves
the problem of an infinite parallelepiped. The method is easily extended by the
methods of a previous paper to treat the problem of polymer stars or of

Conventional multi-stage systems based on scatterers and absorbers offer robust
shielding and efficient collection of losses. Two complementary concepts have
been proposed to address some of the limitations of conventional systems:
channeling and volume reflection in bent crystals and collimation with hollow
electron beams. The main focus of this paper is the hollow electron beam
collimator, a novel concept based on the interaction of the circulating beam
with a 5-keV, magnetically confined, pulsed hollow electron beam in a 2-m-long
section of the ring. The electrons enclose the circulating beam, kicking halo
particles transversely and leaving the beam core unperturbed. By acting as
tunable diffusion enhancer and not as a hard aperture limitation, the hollow
electron beam collimator extends conventional collimation systems beyond the
intensity limits imposed by tolerable losses. The concept was tested
experimentally at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. Results on
the collimation of 980-GeV antiprotons are presented, together with prospects
for the future.

created, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time
multimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly
challenging task since these applications have strict quality-of-service (QoS)
requirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional Internet
protocol (IP)-based best effort service is not able to meet these stringent
requirements. The time-varying nature of wireless channels and resource
constrained wireless devices make the problem even more difficult. To improve
perceived media quality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can
be addressed in different layers, including application layer, transport layer

the rate, power, and coding at the physical (PHY) layer can adapted to meet the
requirements of the applications given the current channel and network

formulas and bounds for the condition number of the Total Least Squares (TLS)
problem. For the TLS problem with the coefficient matrix $A$ and the right-hand
side $b$, a new closed formula is presented for the condition number. Unlike an
important result in the literature that uses the SVDs of both $A$ and $[A,\
b]$, our formula only requires the SVD of $[A,\ b]$. Based on the closed
formula, both lower and upper bounds for the condition number are derived. It
is proved that they are always sharp and estimate the condition number
accurately. A few lower and upper bounds are further established that involve
at most the smallest two singular values of $A$ and of $[A,\ b]$. Tightness of
these bounds is discussed, and numerical experiments are presented to confirm
our theory and to demonstrate the improvement of our upper bounds over the two
upper bounds due to Golub and Van Loan as well as Baboulin and Gratton. Such
lower and upper bounds are particularly useful for large scale TLS problems
since they require the computation of only a few singular values of $A$ and
$[A, \ b]$ other than all the singular values of them.

nanowires under spin waves, external magnetic fields, and current induced spin
transfer torque are studied by micromagnetic simulations. It is found that in
contrast to a stable wall, it is possible to displace a metastable domain wall
in the absence of any external excitation. In addition, independent of the
domain wall excitation method, the velocity of a metastable wall is much
smaller than a stable wall and their displacement direction could be different
from the stable wall depending on the structure of metastable walls. Under the
current induced spin transfer torque excitation, the direction of domain wall
displacement is directly related to the intensity of nonadiabatic spin transfer
torque. In a rough nanowire, it is found that the displacement of a metastable
wall could happen much below the critical excitation of a stable wall.
Furthermore, we show that it is possible to have either a forward or backward
displacement of a metastable domain wall by changing the pulse width of the
excitation.

of the observables of dynamical systems rely, up to now, on the Gnedenko
approach. In this framework, extremes are basically identified with the block
maxima of the time series of the chosen observable, in the limit of infinitely
long blocks. It has been proved that, assuming suitable mixing conditions for
the underlying dynamical systems, the extremes of a specific class of
observables are distributed according to the so called Generalized Extreme
Value (GEV) distribution. Direct calculations show that in the case of
quasi-periodic dynamics the block maxima are not distributed according to the
GEV distribution. In this paper we show that, in order to obtain a universal
behaviour of the extremes, the requirement of a mixing dynamics can be relaxed
if the Pareto approach is used, based upon considering the exceedances over a
given threshold. Requiring that the invariant measure locally scales with a
well defined exponent - the local dimension -, we show that the limiting
distribution for the exceedances of the observables previously studied with the
Gnedenko approach is a Generalized Pareto distribution where the parameters
depends only on the local dimensions and the value of the threshold. This
result allows to extend the extreme value theory for dynamical systems to the
case of regular motions. We also provide connections with the results obtained
with the Gnedenko approach. In order to provide further support to our
findings, we present the results of numerical experiments carried out
considering the well-known Chirikov standard map.

energy dissipation than the energy Szilard's engine is able to produce even if
all sources of dissipation in the rest of these demons (due to measurement,
decision, memory, etc) are neglected.

are introduced. The channel input is an image created by a halftoning algorithm
and its output is the printed picture. Using this channel robustness to noise
between halftoning algorithms can be studied. We introduced relative entropy to
describe immunity of the algorithm to noise and tested several halftoning
algorithms.

nonlocal signals in Si-based multi-terminal devices with ferromagnetic Fe
electrodes. The AMR of the Fe electrodes was found to have a significant
influence on nonlocal signals when the in-plane device structure is not
optimized. Moreover, realization of a pure spin current by spin diffusion was
found to be virtually impossible because of the electric potential distribution
in the depth direction in the Si channel. Although apparent signals indicating
the spin-valve effect were not detected, we mainly present structural influence
on the electric potential distribution which is indispensable for the analyses
of spin-dependent transport.
