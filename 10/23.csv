to higher energy and a single electron tunnels through the device when (1,1,1)

electronic properties of a triple quantum dot are described by a Hubbard model

biased dot. The transport through the triple quantum dot molecule involves both
singly and doubly occupied configurations and necessitates the description of
the (1,1,1) configuration beyond the Heisenberg model. Exact eigenstates of the
triple quantum dot molecule with up to three electrons are used to compute
current assuming weak coupling to the leads and non-equilibrium occupation of
quantum molecule states obtained from the rate equation. The intra-molecular
relaxation processes due to acoustic phonons and cotunneling with the leads are
included, and are shown to play a crucial role in the spin blockade effect. We
find a quantum interference-based spin blockade phenomenon at low source-drain

show that, for an asymmetric quadruple point with

is analogous to the spin blockade in a double quantum dot.

method for simulating complex systems. In this algorithm simulations are
conducted in parallel at a series of temperatures, and the key feature of the
algorithm is a swap mechanism that exchanges configurations between the
parallel simulations at a given rate. The mechanism is designed to allow the
low temperature system of interest to escape from deep local energy minima
where it might otherwise be trapped, via those swaps with the higher

such schemes based on large deviation theory, and argue that the rate of
convergence is a monotone increasing function of the swap rate. This motivates
the study of the limit process as the swap rate goes to infinity. We construct
a scheme which is equivalent to this limit in a distributional sense, but which
involves no swapping at all. Instead, the effect of the swapping is captured by
a collection of weights that influence both the dynamics and the empirical
measure. While theoretically optimal, this limit is not computationally
feasible when the number of temperatures is large, and so variations that are
easy to implement and nearly optimal are also developed.

The small-scale nature of spacetime can be tested with observations of
distant quasars. We comment on a recent paper by Tamburini et al. (A&A, 533,
71) which claims that Hubble Space Telescope observations of the most distant
quasars place severe constraints on models of foamy spacetime.
  Methods. If space is foamy on the Planck scale, photons emitted from distant
objects will accumulate uncertainties in distance and propagation directions
thus affecting the expected angular size of a compact object as a function of
redshift. We discuss the geometry of foamy spacetime, and the appropriate
distance measure for calculating the expected angular broadening. We also
address the mechanics of carrying out such a test. We draw upon our previously
published work on this subject (Christiansen et al. 2011), which carried out
similar tests as Tamburini et al. and also went considerably beyond their work
in several respects.
  Results. When calculating the path taken by photons as they travel from a
distant source to Earth, one must use the comoving distance rather than the
luminosity distance. This then also becomes the appropriate distance to use
when calculating the angular broadening expected in a distant source. The use
of the wrong distance measure causes Tamburini et al. to overstate the
constraints that can be placed on models of spacetime foam. In addition, we
consider the impact of different ways of parametrizing and measuring the
effects of spacetime foam. Given the variation of the shape of the point-spread
function (PSF) on the chip, as well as observation-specific factors, it is
important to select carefully -- and document -- the comparison stars used as
well as the methods used to compute the Strehl ratio.

across the source. HXR photon polarization and spectra produced via
electron-ion bremsstrahlung are calculated from electron distributions typical
for solar flares. Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption are then
modelled using Monte Carlo simulations of photon transport in the photosphere.
Polarization maps across HXR sources (primary and albedo components) for each
of the modelled electron distributions are calculated at various source
locations from the solar centre to the limb. We show that Compton scattering
produces a distinct polarization variation across the albedo patch at peak
albedo energies of 20-50 keV for all anisotropies modelled. The results show
that there are distinct spatial polarization changes in both the radial and
perpendicular to radial directions across the extent of the HXR source at a
given disk location. In the radial direction, the polarization magnitude and
direction at specific positions along the HXR source will either increase or
decrease with increased photon distribution directivity towards the
photosphere. We also show how high electron cutoff energies influence the
direction of polarization at above ~100 keV. Spatially resolved HXR
polarization measurements can provide important information about the
directivity and energetics of the electron distribution. Our results indicate
the preferred angular resolution of polarization measurements required to
distinguish between the scattered and primary components. We also show how

compress-and-forward relaying strategy and ideas from network coding, has
recently drawn much attention for its simplicity and optimality in achieving to
within constant gap of the capacity of the multisource multicast Gaussian
network. The constant-gap result, however, applies only to Gaussian relay
networks with independent noises. This paper investigates the application of
noisy network coding to networks with correlated noises. By focusing on a
four-node Gaussian relay chain network with a particular noise correlation
structure, it is shown that noisy network coding can no longer achieve to
within constant gap to capacity with the choice of Gaussian inputs and Gaussian
quantization. The cut-set bound of the relay chain network in this particular
case, however, can be achieved to within half a bit by a simple concatenation
of a correlation-aware noisy network coding strategy and a decode-and-forward
scheme.

  The main result of this paper is a qualitative description of approximate
groups as being essentially finite-by-nilpotent, answering a conjecture of H.
Helfgott and E. Lindenstrauss. This may be viewed as a generalisation of the
Freiman-Ruzsa theorem on sets of small doubling in the integers to arbitrary

results recently established in a fundamental paper of Hrushovski. In
particular we establish that approximate groups can be approximately modeled by
Lie groups.
  To prove our main theorem we apply some additional arguments essentially due
to Gleason. These arose in the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem in the
1950s.
  Applications of our main theorem include a finitary refinement of Gromov's

deformable shape analysis. For example, they have been successfully employed in
correspondence, registration, and retrieval tasks. In the recent years,
significant attention has been devoted to descriptors obtained from the
spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the
shape. Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and
the wave kernel signature (WKS). Laplacian-based descriptors achieve
state-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are
computationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can
gracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate
a generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that in order to
be optimal for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the
statistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the ""signal"") and
those of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the
""noise""). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be
learned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal
processing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimal spectral
descriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of
the proposed approach is demonstrated on the SHREC'10 benchmark.

gravitational collapse of fermionic spin-fluid matter with the stiff equation
of state in a stellar black hole. Such a collapse increases the mass of the
matter, which occurs through the Parker-Zel'dovich-Starobinskii quantum
particle production in strong, anisotropic gravitational fields. The subsequent
pair annihilation changes the stiff matter into an ultrarelativistic fluid. We

  Rev. D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.84.113012",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that the Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) parametrization of the 3 X 3 lepton
flavor mixing matrix is a useful language to describe the phenomenology of
neutrino oscillations. In particular, it provides us with a convenient way to
link the genuine flavor mixing parameters (\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 and
\delta_KM) to their effective counterparts in matter (\tilde{\theta}_1,
\tilde{\theta}_2, \tilde{\theta}_3 and \tilde{\delta}_KM). We rediscover the
Toshev-like relation sin \tilde{\delta}_KM sin 2\tilde{\theta}_2 = sin
\delta_KM sin 2\theta_2 in the KM parametrization. We make reasonable
analytical approximations to the exact relations between the genuine and
matter-corrected flavor mixing parameters in two different experimental
scenarios: (a) the neutrino beam energy E is above O(1) GeV and (b) E is below
O(1) GeV. As an example, the probability of \nu_\mu -> \nu_e oscillations and
CP-violating effects are calculated for the upcoming NOvA and Hyper-K
experiments.

consists in showing that there exist two (p-1)-dimensional convex polytopes P_1

polytopes coincide. Introduced in \cite{C1}, P_1 is the set of spectra

\partialF^{\infty}=-gJ with a current J as source and such that the Lorentz

J={\gamma}^{5}J_{m}is a spacelike field (even if F is not a superluminal

there exists a solution F of the free Maxwell \partialF=0 that is equivalent to
the non homogeneous equation for F^{\infty}. Once this result is proved it
suggests by itself to look for more general subluminal and superluminal
solutions F of the free Maxwell equation equivalent to a non homogeneous
Maxwell equation for a field F_{0} with a current term as source which may be
subluminal or superluminal. We exhibit one such subluminal solution, for which
the Dirac-Hestenes spinor field {\psi} associated the electromagnetic field
F_{0} satisfies a Dirac equation for a bradyonic neutrino under the ansatz that
the current is ce^{{\lambda}{\gamma}^{5}}g{\psi}{\gamma}^{0}{\psi}, with g the
quantum of magnetic charge and {\lambda} a constant to be determined in such a
way that the auto-force be null. Together with Dirac's quantization condition
this gives a quantized mass spectrum (Eq.49) for the neutrinos, with the masses
of the different flavor neutrinos being of the same order of magnitude (Eq.50)
which is in accord with recent experimental findings. As a last surprise we
show that the mass spectrum found in the previous case continues to hold if the
current is taken spacelike, i.e.,
ce^{{\lambda}{\gamma}^{5}}g{\psi}_{>}{\gamma}^{3}{\psi}_{>} with {\psi}_{>}, in

perturbed the terrestrial planets. We identify six secular resonances between
the nu_5 apsidal eigenfrequency of Jupiter and Saturn and the four
eigenfrequencies of the terrestrial planets (g_{1-4}). We derive analytic upper
limits on the eccentricity and orbital migration timescale of Jupiter and
Saturn when these resonances were encountered to avoid perturbing the
eccentricities of the terrestrial planets to values larger than the observed
ones. If Jupiter and Saturn migrated with eccentricities comparable to their
present day values, smooth migration with exponential timescales characteristic
of planetesimal-driven migration (\tau~5-10 Myr) would have perturbed the
eccentricities of the terrestrial planets to values greatly exceeding the
observed ones. This excitation may be mitigated if the eccentricity of Jupiter
was small during the migration epoch, migration was very rapid (e.g. \tau<~ 0.5
Myr perhaps via planet-planet scattering or instability-driven migration) or
the observed small eccentricity amplitudes of the j=2,3 terrestrial modes
result from low probability cancellation of several large amplitude
contributions. Further, results of orbital integrations show that very short
migration timescales (\tau<0.5 Myr), characteristic of instability-driven
migration, may also perturb the terrestrial planets' eccentricities by amounts
comparable to their observed values. We discuss the implications of these
constraints for the relative timing of terrestrial planet formation, giant
planet migration, and the origin of the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment of the
Moon 3.9+/-0.1 Ga ago. We suggest that the simplest way to satisfy these
dynamical constraints may be for the bulk of any giant planet migration to be
complete in the first 30-100 Myr of solar system history.

representations of the Poincare group with an arbitrary Young tableaux having k
rows, on a basis of the universal BRST approach. Starting with a description of
bosonic mixed-symmetry higher-spin fields in a flat space of any dimension in
terms of an auxiliary Fock space associated with special Poincare module, we
realize a conversion of the initial operator constraint system (constructed
with respect to the relations extracting irreducible Poincare-group
representations) into a first-class constraint system. For this purpose, we
find, for the first time, auxiliary representations of the constraint
subalgebra, to be isomorphic due to Howe duality to sp(2k) algebra, and
containing the subsystem of second-class constraints in terms of new oscillator
variables. We propose a universal procedure of constructing unconstrained
gauge-invariant Lagrangians with reducible gauge symmetries describing the
dynamics of both massless and massive bosonic fields of any spin. It is shown
that the space of BRST cohomologies with a vanishing ghost number is determined
only by the constraints corresponding to an irreducible Poincare-group
representation. As examples of the general procedure, we formulate the method
of Lagrangian construction for bosonic fields subject to arbitrary Young
tableaux having 3 rows and derive the gauge-invariant Lagrangian for new model
of massless rank-4 tensor field with spin $(2,1,1)$ and second-stage reducible
gauge symmetries.

are of essential interest in combinatorics and coding theory. They are
formulated in terms of metric balls of vertices. We consider a new problem in
graph theory which is also based on the consideration of metric balls of
vertices, but which is distinct from the traditional packing and covering
problems. This problem is motivated by applications in information transmission
when redundancy of messages is not sufficient for their exact reconstruction,
and applications in computational biology when one wishes to restore an
evolutionary process. It can be defined as the reconstruction, or
identification, of an unknown vertex in a given graph from a minimal number of
vertices (erroneous or distorted patterns) in a metric ball of a given radius r
around the unknown vertex. For this problem it is required to find minimum
restrictions for such a reconstruction to be possible and also to find
efficient reconstruction algorithms under such minimal restrictions.
  In this paper we define error graphs and investigate their basic properties.
A particular class of error graphs occurs when the vertices of the graph are
the elements of a group, and when the path metric is determined by a suitable
set of group elements. These are the undirected Cayley graphs. Of particular
interest is the transposition Cayley graph on the symmetric group which occurs
in connection with the analysis of transpositional mutations in molecular
biology. We obtain a complete solution of the above problems for the
transposition Cayley graph on the symmetric group.

parallel to QCD, a quantum-mechanical potential model. In the latter case, the
exact form factor may be calculated from the solutions of the Schr\""odinger

local-duality sum rule. We find that the local-duality sum rule is expected to
yield reliable predictions for both F_pi(Q^2) and F_{pi gamma}(Q^2) in the
region Q^2 > 5-6 GeV^2. Moreover, in this region the accuracy of this approach
improves rather fast with increasing Q^2. For the elastic form factor
F_pi(Q^2), we are therefore forced to conclude that large deviations from the
local-duality limit in the region Q^2 = 20-50 GeV^2 reported in some recent
theoretical studies seem to us unlikely. The data on the eta, eta' to gamma

of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of different types of
supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of galaxies, require
complete and homogeneous sets of stellar models at different metallicities in
order to be studied during the whole of cosmic history. We present here a first
set of models for solar metallicity, where the effects of rotation are
accounted for in a homogeneous way.
  We computed a grid of 48 different stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating
and non-rotating, at Z=0.014, spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 Msun.
For each of the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data for
400 stages along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of 43 physical
data are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and detailed data basis
for comparisons with the observations. The rotating models start on the ZAMS
with a rotation rate Vini/Vcrit=0.4. The evolution is computed until the end of
the central carbon-burning phase, the early AGB phase, or the core helium-flash
for, respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass
stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and collaborators,
which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars in the solar
neighbourhood. We update both the opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and
introduce new prescriptions for the mass-loss rates as stars approach the
Eddington and/or the critical velocity. We account for both atomic diffusion
and magnetic braking in our low-mass star models. [...]

of Bloggers by using the agent-based modeling and the parameters inferred from
the related empirical data.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: A bipartite network of emotional agents and
posts evolves through the addition of agents and their actions on posts. The
emotion state of an agent,quantified by the arousal and the valence, fluctuates
in time due to events on the connected posts, and in the moments of agent's
action it is transferred to a selected post. We claim that the indirect
communication of the emotion in the model rules, combined with the action-delay
time and the circadian rhythm extracted from the empirical data, can explain
the genesis of emotional bursts by users on popular Blogs and similar Web
portals. The model also identifies the parameters and how they influence the
course of the dynamics.
  Conclusions: The collective behavior is here recognized by the emergence of
communities on the network and the fractal time-series of their emotional
comments, powered by the negative emotion (critique). The evolving agents
communities leave characteristic patterns of the activity in the phase space of
the arousal--valence variables, where each segment represents a common emotion
described in psychology.
