the second law of thermodynamics by evaluating a probability measure-valued
process. In order to establish a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic
behaviors, we consider the thermodynamic limit of a stochastic dynamical system
following the fundamental procedure often used in statistical mechanics. The
thermodynamic path characterizing a macroscopic dynamical behavior can be
formulated as an infimum of the action functional for the probability
measure-valued process. In our formulation, the second law of thermodynamics
can be derived by symmetry of the action functional, which is generated from
the fluctuation theorem. We find that our formulation not only confirms that
the ordinary Jarzynski equality in the thermodynamic limit can be rederived,
but also enables us to establish a nontrivial nonequilibrium work relation for
metastable states.

Although there is ample experimental evidence for such correlations, there has
been disagreement about how high in temperature they may persist, their role in
the phenomenology of the pseudogap, and their significance for understanding
high-temperature superconductivity. In this work we use THz time-domain

tachocline. The model consists of a global spherical shell of differentially
rotating fluid, which has a deformable top, thus allowing motions in radial
directions along with latitude and longitude directions. When the system is
perturbed, in the course of its nonlinear evolution it can generate unstable
low-frequency shallow-water shear modes from the differential rotation,
high-frequency gravity waves, and their interactions. Radiative and overshoot
tachoclines are characterized in this model by high and low effective gravity
values respectively. Building a semi-implicit spectral scheme containing very
low numerical diffusion, we perform nonlinear evolution of shallow-water modes.
Our first results show that, (i) high latitude jets or polar spin-up occurs due
to nonlinear evolution of unstable hydrodynamic shallow-water disturbances and
differential rotation, (ii) Reynolds stresses in the disturbances together with
changing shell-thickness and meridional flow are responsible for the evolution
of differential rotation, (iii) disturbance energy primarily remains
concentrated in the lowest longitudinal wavenumbers, (iv) an oscillation in
energy between perturbed and unperturbed states occurs due to evolution of
these modes in a nearly dissipation-free system, and (v) disturbances are
geostrophic, but occasional nonadjustment in geostrophic balance can occur,
particularly in the case of high effective gravity, leading to generation of
gravity waves. We also find that a linearly stable differential rotation
profile remains nonlinearly stable.

the CMB's polarization anisotropy, specifically its curl component (called
""B-mode"" polarization), which remains undetected. The inflationary paradigm
predicts the existence of a primordial gravitational wave background that
imprints a unique B-mode signature on the CMB's polarization at large angular
scales. The CMB B-mode signal also encodes gravitational lensing information at
smaller angular scales, bearing the imprint of cosmological large scale
structures (LSS) which in turn may elucidate the properties of cosmological
neutrinos. The quest for detection of these signals; each of which is orders of
magnitude smaller than the CMB temperature anisotropy signal, has motivated the
development of background-limited detectors with precise control of systematic
effects. The POLARBEAR experiment is designed to perform a deep search for the
signature of gravitational waves from inflation and to characterize lensing of
the CMB by LSS. POLARBEAR is a 3.5 meter ground-based telescope with 3.8
arcminute angular resolution at 150 GHz. At the heart of the POLARBEAR receiver
is an array featuring 1274 antenna-coupled superconducting transition edge

systems/behaviors. For various reasons, in the context of uncontrollable
systems/behaviors, a more appropriate definition of dissipativity is in terms
of the dissipation inequality, namely the {\em existence} of a storage
function. A storage function is a function such that along every system
trajectory, the rate of increase of the storage function is at most the power
supplied. While the power supplied is always expressed in terms of only the
external variables, whether or not the storage function should be allowed to
depend on unobservable/hidden variables also has various consequences on the
notion of dissipativity: this paper thoroughly investigates the key aspects of
both cases, and also proposes another intuitive definition of dissipativity.
  We first assume that the storage function can be expressed in terms of the
external variables and their derivatives only and prove our first main result
that, assuming the uncontrollable poles are unmixed, i.e. no pair of
uncontrollable poles add to zero, and assuming a strictness of dissipativity at
the infinity frequency, the dissipativities of a system and its controllable
part are equivalent. We also show that the storage function in this case is a
static state function.
  We then investigate the utility of unobservable/hidden variables in the
definition of storage function: we prove that lossless autonomous behaviors
require storage function to be unobservable from external variables. We next
propose another intuitive definition: a behavior is called dissipative if it
can be embedded in a controllable dissipative {\em super-behavior}. We show
that this definition imposes a constraint on the number of inputs and thus
explains unintuitive examples from the literature in the context of
lossless/orthogonal behaviors.

active-sterile supernova neutrino oscillations. We always include the feedback
effect on the electron fraction Y_e due to neutrino oscillations. In all

affect the conditions for heavy-element formation in the supernova ejecta, even

Pl_R, compute its effect on the discrete and continuous series components of
the space of functions H(H_R) and obtain a surprising formula for the
Plancherel measure of SL(2,R). The proof is based on a transition to the
Minkowski space M and some pretty lengthy computations. In this paper we
introduce an operator d/dR Pl_R on H(H_R) and show that its effect on the
discrete and continuous series components can be easily computed using the
Schrodinger model for the minimal representation of O(p,q) (with p=q=3) and the
results of Kobayashi-Mano from [KM], particularly their computation of the
integral expression for the operator F_C. This provides an independent
verification of the coefficients involved in the formula for Pl_R. This paper
once again demonstrates a close connection between quaternionic analysis and
representation theory of various O(p,q)'s.

hydro-magnetic coupling between the solid crust and the fluid core. In this
paper we set up a ""spectral"" computational framework in which the magnetar's
motion is decomposed into a series of basis functions which are associated with
the crust and core vibrational eigenmodes. A general-relativistic formalism is
presented for evaluation of the core Alfven modes in the magnetic-flux
coordinates, as well for eigenmode computation of a strongly magnetized crust
of finite thickness. By considering coupling of the crustal modes to the
continuum of Alfven modes in the core, we construct a fully relativistic
dynamical model of the magnetar which allows: i) Fast and long simulations
without numerical dissipation. ii) Very fine sampling of the stellar structure.
We find that the presence of strong magnetic field in the crust results in
localizing of some high-frequency crustal elasto-magnetic modes with the radial
number n>1 to the regions of the crust where the field is nearly horizontal.
While the hydro-magnetic coupling of these localized modes to the Alfven
continuum in the core is reduced, their energy is drained on a time-scale much
less than 1 second. Therefore the puzzle of the observed QPOs with frequencies
larger than 600 Hz still stands.

include a new aspect of the relative velocity effect found in recent

three separate effects: suppression of the halo abundance, suppression of the
gas content within each halo, and boosting of the minimum cooling mass. We show
that the two suppressions (of gas content and of halo abundance) are the
primary effects on the small minihalos that cannot form stars, while the
cooling mass boost combines with the abundance suppression to produce order
unity fluctuations in stellar density. We quantify the large-scale
inhomogeneity of galaxies, finding that 68% of the star formation (averaged on
a 3 Mpc scale) is confined to 35% of the volume at z=20 (and just 18% at z=40).

K, x=0.125 with T_c ~ 2.4 K, and x=0.145 with T_c ~ 24 K. The in-plane behavior
of the optical conductivity for these materials at high temperature is
described by a Drude-like response with a scattering rate that decreases with
temperature. Below T_c in the x=0.095 and 0.145 materials there is a clear
signature of the formation of a SC state in the optical properties allowing the
strength of the condensate (\rho_{s0}) and the penetration depth to be
determined. In the anomalous 1/8 phase, some spectral weight shifts from lower
to higher frequency (above 300 cm^{-1}) on cooling below the spin-ordering
temperature T_{so} ~ 42 K, associated with the onset of spin-stripe order; we
discuss alternative interpretations in terms of a conventional density-wave gap
versus the response to pair-density-wave SC. The disappearance of the
low-frequency spectral weight at low temperature may indicate the formation of
a 2D SC state below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at about 16
K prior to the onset of bulk 3D SC. The two dopings for which a SC response is
observed both fall on the universal scaling line \rho_{s0}/8 ~ 4.4 \sigma_{dc}

insulating character dominated by lattice vibrations, superimposed on a weak
electronic background. In the x=0.095 and 0.145 materials a Josephson plasma
edge is observed in the reflectance below T_c. No Josephson plasma edge is
observed in the 1/8 phase, suggesting that the presence of charge and spin
order frustrates the formation of a supercurrent and bulk 3D SC.

specific situation is very instructive, for it makes it easy to realize that
the Lindblads represent the effect on the main system caused by the interaction
with the bath, and that the Markov approximation is a fundamental condition for
the emergence of the Lindbladian operator. The formal derivation of the

barrel layers and three endcap disks is being designed. We will present the key
points of the design: the new geometry, which minimizes the material budget and
increases the tracking points, and the development of a fast digital readout
architecture, which ensures readout efficiency even at high rate. The expected
performances for tracking and vertexing of the new pixel detector are also
addressed.

quantum field induced by a generalized cosmic string in D-dimensional anti-de
Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In order to develop this analysis we evaluate the
corresponding Wightman function. As we shall observe, this function is
expressed as the sum of two terms: the first one corresponds to the Wightman
function in pure AdS bulk and the second one is induced by the presence of the
string. The second contribution is finite at coincidence limit and is used to
provide closed expressions for the parts in the VEVs of the field squared and
the energy-momentum tensor induced by the presence of the string. Because the
analysis of vacuum polarizations effects in pure AdS spacetime have been
developed in the literature, here we are mainly interested in the investigation
of string-induced effects. We show that the curvature of the background
spacetime has an essential influence on the VEVs at distances larger than the
curvature radius. In particular, at large distances the decay of the
string-induced VEVs is power-law for both massless and massive fields. The
string-induced parts vanish on the AdS boundary and they dominate the pure AdS

Recently it was suggested that quantum coherence and its interplay with thermal

work we present an experimental strategy for using time resolved infrared
spectroscopy to investigate these effects. We show the feasibility by
demonstrating the IR absorption and Raman spectroscopic signatures of potassium
binding model molecules that mimic the transient interactions of potassium with
binding sites of the selectivity filter during ion conduction. In addition to
guide our experiments on the real system we have performed molecular
dynamic-based simulations of the FTIR and 2DIR spectra of the entire KcsA
complex, which is the largest complex for which such modeling has been
performed. We found that by combing isotope labeling with 2D IR spectroscopy,
the signatures of potassium interaction with individual binding sites would be
experimentally observable and identified specific labeling combinations that
would maximize our expected experimental signatures.

$\omega\simeq\Delta/\sqrt{5}$. Excitation of the high-frequency spin
oscillations in the condensate occurs through the tensor interactions between

  Neutrino energy losses through neutral weak currents are found to consist of
three separate contributions caused by a recombination of broken Cooper pairs

finite lattice method (FLM) with exact transfer matrix enumerations. The models
encompass all integrable curves of the Q-state Potts model on the square and
triangular lattices, including the antiferromagnetic transition curves and the
Ising model (Q=2) at temperature T, as well as a fully-packed O(n) type loop
model on the square lattice. The expansions are around the trivial fixed points
at infinite Q, n or 1/T.
  By using a carefully chosen expansion parameter, q << 1, all expansions turn
out to be of the form \prod_{k=1}^\infty (1-q^k)^{\alpha_k + k \beta_k}, where
the coefficients \alpha_k and \beta_k are periodic functions of k. Thanks to
this periodicity property we can conjecture the form of the expansions to all
orders (except in a few cases where the periodicity is too large). These
expressions are then valid for all 0 <= q < 1.
  We analyse in detail the q \to 1^- limit in which the models become critical.
In this limit the divergence of the corner free energy defines a universal term
which can be compared with the conformal field theory (CFT) predictions of
Cardy and Peschel. This allows us to deduce the asymptotic expressions for the
correlation length in several cases.
  Finally we work out the FLM formulae for the case where some of the system's
boundaries are endowed with particular (non-free) boundary conditions. We apply
this in particular to the square-lattice Potts model with Jacobsen-Saleur
boundary conditions, conjecturing the expansions of the surface and corner free
energies to arbitrary order for any integer value of the boundary interaction
parameter r. These results are in turn compared with CFT predictions.

occur on accreting neutron stars. We create the first multi-zone models of
series of superbursts using a stellar evolution code. We self-consistently
build up the fuel layer at different rates, spanning the entire range of
observed mass accretion rates for superbursters. For all models light curves
are presented. They generally exhibit a shock breakout, a precursor burst due
to shock heating, and a two-component power-law decay. Shock heating alone is
sufficient for a bright precursor, that follows the shock breakout on a short
dynamical time scale due to the fall-back of expanded layers. Models at the
highest accretion rates, however, lack a shock breakout, precursor, and the
first power law decay component. The ashes of the superburst that form the
outer crust are predominantly composed of iron, but a superburst leaves a
silicon-rich layer behind in which the next one ignites. Comparing the model
light curves to an observed superburst from 4U 1636-53, we find for our
accretion composition the best agreement with a model at three times the
observed accretion rate. We study the dependence on crustal heating of
observables such as the recurrence time and the decay time scale. It remains
difficult, however, to constrain crustal heating, if there is no good match
with the observed accretion rate, as we see for 4U 1636-53.

bounds on arbitrary correlation functions. These bounds enforce an {\em

certain symmetries. {\em Exact} dimensional reduction can stem from a duality
that (i) follows from properties of the local density of states, and/or (ii)
from properties of Hamiltonian-dependent algebras of interactions. Dualities of
the first type (i) are illustrated with large-$n$ vector theories whose local
density of states may remain invariant under transformations that change the
dimension. We argue that a broad class of examples of dimensional reduction may
be understood in terms of the functional dependence of observables on the local

algebras}, a recently developed algebraic tool. We apply this technique to
systems displaying topological quantum order, and also discuss the implications

levels and matrix elements. Finite size corrections that decay exponentially in
the volume are usually neglected or taken into account using perturbation
expansion in effective field theory. Using two-dimensional sine-Gordon field
theory as ""toy model"" it is shown that some exponential finite size effects
could be much larger than previously thought, potentially spoiling the
determination of matrix elements in frameworks such as lattice QCD. The
particular class of finite size corrections considered here are mu-terms
arising from bound state poles in the scattering amplitudes. In sine-Gordon
model, these can be explicitly evaluated and shown to explain the observed
discrepancies to high precision. It is argued that the effects observed are not
special to the two-dimensional setting, but rather depend on general field
theoretic features that are common with models relevant for particle physics.
It is important to understand these finite size corrections as they present a
potentially dangerous source of systematic errors for the determination of

find a critical electronic density at which the transport switches from single

LaAlO3 thickness and electron mobility. The characteristics of the transition,
its universality, and its compatibility with spectroscopic measurements
establish it as a transition between d-orbitals of different symmetries. A
simple band model, allowing for spin-orbit coupling at the atomic level,
connects the observed universal transition to a range of reported
magnetotransport properties. Interestingly, we also find that the maximum of
the superconducting transition temperature occurs at the same critical
transition, indicating a possible connection between the two phenomena. Our
observations demonstrate that orbital degeneracies play an important role in
the fascinating behavior observed so far in these oxides.

develop fast and robust algorithms for evaluating radiative cooling. Here we
undertake a critical evaluation of what is currently a popular method for
prescribing cooling in SPH simulations, i.e. the polytropic cooling due
originally to Stamatellos et al. This method uses the local density and
potential to estimate the column density and optical depth to each particle and
then uses these quantities to evaluate an approximate expression for the net
radiative cooling. We evaluate the algorithm by considering both spherical and
disc-like systems with analytic density and temperature structures. In
spherical systems, the total cooling rate computed by the method is within
around 20 for the astrophysically relevant case of opacity dominated by ice
grains and is correct to within a factor of order unity for a range of opacity
laws. In disc geometry, however, the method systematically under-estimates the
cooling by a large factor at all heights in the disc. For the self-gravitating
disc studied, we find that the method under-estimates the total cooling rate by
a factor of 200. This discrepancy may be readily traced to the method's
systematic over-estimate of the disc column density and optical depth, since
(being based only on the local density and potential) it does not take into
account the low column density route for photon escape normal to the disc
plane. These results raise an obvious caution about the method's use in disc
geometry whenever an accurate cooling rate is required, although we note that
there are situations where the discrepancies highlighted above may not
significantly affect the global outcome of simulations. Finally, we draw
attention to our introduction of an analytic self-gravitating disc structure
that may be of use in the calibration of future cooling algorithms.

theories leads to tension with unitarity because it allows for processes that
apparently violate the second law of thermodynamics. The crucial ingredient of
this argument is the existence of black hole solutions with the interior
shielded from infinity by a causal horizon. We study how the paradox can be
resolved in the healthy extension of Horava gravity. To this aim we analyze
classical solutions describing large black holes in this theory with the
emphasis on their causal structure. The notion of causality is subtle in this
theory due to the presence of instantaneous interactions. Despite this fact, we
find that within exact spherical symmetry a black hole solution contains a
space-time region causally disconnected from infinity by a surface of finite
area -- the `universal horizon'. We then consider small perturbations of
arbitrary angular dependence in the black hole background. We argue that
aspherical perturbations destabilize the universal horizon and, at non-linear
level, turn it into a finite-area singularity. The causal structure of the
region outside the singularity is trivial. If the higher-derivative terms in
the equations of motion smear the singularity while preserving the trivial
causal structure of the solutions, the thermodynamics paradox would be
obviated. As a byproduct of our analysis we prove that the black holes do not
have any non-standard long-range hair. We also comment on the relation with
Einstein-aether theory, where the solutions with universal horizon appear to be
stable.

swimming direction (towards or away from the cap); the particle size determines
the rotational diffusion and, therefore, the random reorientation of the

These approaches generalize the fixpoint-based and the level mapping based

definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs. The
standard fixpoint-based semantics of logic programs is generalized in two
directions, called answer set by reduct and answer set by complement. These
definitions, which differ from each other in the treatment of
negation-as-failure (naf) atoms, make use of an immediate consequence operator
to perform answer set checking, whose definition relies on the notion of
conditional satisfaction of c-atoms w.r.t. a pair of interpretations. The other
two definitions, called strongly and weakly well-supported models, are
generalizations of the notion of well-supported models of normal logic programs
to the case of programs with c-atoms. As for the case of fixpoint-based
semantics, the difference between these two definitions is rooted in the
treatment of naf atoms. We prove that answer sets by reduct (resp. by
complement) are equivalent to weakly (resp. strongly) well-supported models of
a program, thus generalizing the theorem on the correspondence between stable
models and well-supported models of a normal logic program to the class of
programs with c-atoms. We show that the newly defined semantics coincide with
previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone c-atoms, and
they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs. We also
study some properties of answer sets of programs with c-atoms, and relate our

including nogood-based pruning techniques that allow further exploitation of
the dominance criterion. Bin completion is applied to four problems: multiple

essential and coexisting aspects. We present a formalism where quantitative
temporal constraints with both preferences and uncertainty can be defined. We
show how three classical notions of controllability (that is, strong, weak, and
dynamic), which have been developed for uncertain temporal problems, can be
generalized to handle preferences as well. After defining this general
framework, we focus on problems where preferences follow the fuzzy approach,
and with properties that assure tractability. For such problems, we propose
algorithms to check the presence of the controllability properties. In

time granularity and its applications. A first stream of research investigated
the mathematical models behind the notion of granularity and the algorithms to
manage temporal data based on those models. A second stream of research
investigated symbolic formalisms providing a set of algebraic operators to
define granularities in a compact and compositional way. However, only very
limited manipulation algorithms have been proposed to operate directly on the
algebraic representation making it unsuitable to use the symbolic formalisms in
applications that need manipulation of granularities.
  This paper aims at filling the gap between the results from these two streams
of research, by providing an efficient conversion from the algebraic
representation to the equivalent low-level representation based on the
mathematical models. In addition, the conversion returns a minimal
representation in terms of period length. Our results have a major practical
impact: users can more easily define arbitrary granularities in terms of
algebraic operators, and then access granularity reasoning and other services
operating efficiently on the equivalent, minimal low-level representation. As
an example, we illustrate the application to temporal constraint reasoning with
multiple granularities.
  From a technical point of view, we propose an hybrid algorithm that
interleaves the conversion of calendar subexpressions into periodical sets with
the minimization of the period length. The algorithm returns set-based
granularity representations having minimal period length, which is the most
relevant parameter for the performance of the considered reasoning services.
Extensive experimental work supports the techniques used in the algorithm, and
shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB$_2$ chain has a flat band even in the presence of magnetic flux. We show
that the respective localized states can be written in the most compact form as
standing waves in one or two consecutive plaquettes. We show that this result
is easily generalized to other frustrated lattices such as the Lieb lattice. A
restricted Hartree-Fock study of the $V/t$ versus filling phase diagram of the

is determined using the mean-field approach and exactly for infinite or zero
$V$. In the strong-coupling limit, two kinds of localized states occur:
one-particle localized states due to geometry and two-particle localized states
due to interaction and geometry. These localized fermions create open boundary
regions for itinerant carriers. At filling $\rho=2/9$ and in order to avoid the
existence of itinerant fermions with positive kinetic energy, phase separation
occurs between a high-density phase ($\rho=2/3$) and a low-density phase
($\rho=2/9$) leading to a metal-insulator transition. The ground-state energy
reflects such phase separation by becoming linear on filling above 2/9. We
argue that for filling near or larger than 2/9, the spectrum of the t-V AB$_2$

close agreement with Alvi's analytic predictions, and the remnant hole's final

radius outside a dead zone, if the mass loss rate due to photoevaporative winds
exceeds the mass accretion rate in the dead zone region. Since the dead zone
survives even after the gap opens, mass accretion onto the central star
continues for a long time. This model can reproduce large gap sizes and high

model includes the long-term fluctuations of the \alpha-effect and two types of
the nonlinear feedback of the mean-field on the \alpha-effect including the
algebraic quenching and the dynamic quenching due to the magnetic helicity
generation. We found that the models are able to reproduce qualitatively and
quantitatively the inclination and dispersion across the Waldmeier relations
with the 20% fluctuations of the \alpha-effect. The models with the dynamic
quenching are in a better agreement with observations than the models with the
algebraic \alpha-quenching. We compare the statistical distributions of the

radial velocity technique. But at the accuracy level of 1 m.s-1, required for
super-Earth characterization, stability of fiber-fed spectrograph performance
is crucial considering variable observing conditions such as seeing, guiding
and centering errors and, telescope vignetting. In fiber-fed spectrographs such
as HARPS or SOPHIE, the fiber link scrambling properties are one of the main
issues. Both the stability of the fiber near-field uniformity at the
spectrograph entrance and of the far-field illumination on the echelle grating
(pupil) are critical for high-precision radial velocity measurements due to the
spectrograph geometrical field and aperture aberrations. We conducted tests on
the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93-m OHP telescope to measure the instrument
sensitivity to the fiber link light feeding conditions: star decentering,
telescope vignetting by the dome,and defocussing.
  To significantly improve on current precision, we designed a fiber link
modification considering the spectrograph operational constraints. We have
developed a new link which includes a piece of octagonal-section fiber, having
good scrambling properties, lying inside the former circular-section fiber, and
we tested the concept on a bench to characterize near-field and far-field
scrambling properties.
  This modification has been implemented in spring 2011 on the SOPHIE
spectrograph fibers and tested for the first time directly on the sky to
demonstrate the gain compared to the previous fiber link. Scientific validation
for exoplanet search and characterization has been conducted by observing
standard stars.

The proper interpretation of the loop corrections is via particle creation
revealing itself through the generation of the quantum averages $<a^+_p a_p>$,
$<a_p a_{-p}>$ and $<a^+_p a^+_{-p}>$, which slowly change in time. We show
that this observation in particular means that loop corrections to correlation

those calculated on the sphere.
  We find harmonics for which the particle number $<a^+_p a_p>$ dominates over
the anomalous expectation values $<a_p a_{-p}>$ and $<a^+_p a^+_{-p}>$. For
these harmonics the Dyson--Schwinger equation reduces in the IR limit to the

Point Spread Functions (PSFs) extracted from each speckle frame and the
(optional) simultaneous use of multiple reference stars. In this way, high
signal-to-noise and accuracy can be achieved on the PSF for each short
exposure, which results in sensitive, high-Strehl re- constructed images. We
have tested our method with different instruments, on a range of targets, and
from the N- to the I-band. In terms of PSF cosmetics, stability and Strehl
ratio, holographic imaging can be equal, and even superior, to the capabilities
of currently available Adaptive Optics (AO) systems, particularly at short
near-infrared to optical wavelengths. It outperforms lucky imaging because it
makes use of the entire PSF and reduces the need for frame selection, thus
leading to higher Strehl and improved sensitivity. Image reconstruction a
posteriori, the possibility to use multiple reference stars and the fact that
these reference stars can be rather faint means that holographic imaging offers
a simple way to image large, dense stellar fields near the diffraction limit of
large telescopes, similar to, but much less technologically demanding than, the
capabilities of a multi-conjugate adaptive optics system. The method can be
used with a large range of already existing imaging instruments and can also be
combined with AO imaging when the corrected PSF is unstable.

represented as the stationary signal over a short interval of time, most of

subtracting the reconstructed noise from the speech degraded by additive

causes: collision and channel noise. However, in 802.11 WLAN, a station cannot
know the cause of a transmission failure, thus the adaptive schemes assume the
ideal situation in which all transmission failures occur by only one of two
causes. For this reason, they may behave erroneously in a real world where
transmission failures occur by both causes. In this paper, we propose a novel

scattering processes with medium constituents. The magnitude of this energy
loss contribution depends crucially on the effective mass of the medium
constituents - in the limit of non-recoiling static scattering centers, elastic
energy loss vanishes. Thus, it is important to constrain the amount of elastic
energy loss in order to gain information about the nature of the degrees of
freedom in the medium as resolved by a hard parton. So far, the relative
fraction of elastic (or rather incoherent) energy loss has been constrained
from above by using pathlength dependent observables. However, using the
observation that subleading gluon energy dissipation into the medium is probed
by some observables, such as hard dihadron correlations or the dijet asymmetry,
a constraint from below can also be found. In this work, this idea is worked

engineering such as steady state distribution of heat, fluid dynamics,
structural/mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering and seismology etc. In
three dimensions it is well known that the solutions of elliptic boundary value
problems have singular behavior near the corners and edges of the domain. The
singularities which arise are known as vertex, edge, and vertex-edge
singularities. We propose a nonconforming h-p spectral element method to solve
three dimensional elliptic boundary value problems on non-smooth domains to
exponential accuracy. To overcome the singularities which arise in the
neighbourhoods of the vertices, vertex-edges and edges we use local systems of
coordinates. These local coordinates are modified versions of spherical and
cylindrical coordinate systems in their respective neighbourhoods. Away from
these neighbourhoods standard Cartesian coordinates are used. In each of these
neighbourhoods we use a geometrical mesh which becomes finer near the corners
and edges. We then derive differentiability estimates in these new set of
variables and a stability estimate on which our method is based for a
non-conforming h-p spectral element method. The Sobolev spaces in vertex-edge
and edge neighbourhoods are anisotropic and become singular at the corners and
edges.
  The method is essentially a least-squares collocation} method and a solution
can be obtained using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Method (PCGM). To solve
the minimization problem we need to solve the normal equations for the
least-squares problem. The residuals in the normal equations can be obtained
without computing and storing mass and stiffness matrices. Computational
results for a number of model problems confirm the theoretical estimates
obtained for the error and computational complexity.

deterministic and non-deterministic, with compressed transition labels is
studied. The compression is represented by straight-line programs (SLPs), i.e.
context-free grammars generating exactly one string. A novel technique of
dealing with SLPs is introduced: the SLPs are recompressed, so that substrings
of the input text are encoded in SLPs labelling the transitions of the NFA
(DFA) in the same way, as in the SLP representing the input text. To this end,
the SLPs are locally decompressed and then recompressed in a uniform way.
Furthermore, such recompression induces only small changes in the automaton, in
particular, the size of the automaton remains polynomial.
  Using this technique it is shown that the compressed membership for NFA with
compressed labels is in NP, thus confirming the conjecture of Plandowski and
Rytter and extending the partial result of Lohrey and Mathissen; as it is
already known, that this problem is NP-hard, we settle its exact computational
complexity. Moreover, the same technique applied to the compressed membership
for DFA with compressed labels yields that this problem is in P; for this
problem, only trivial upper-bound PSPACE was known.

simulations is that bundles of quantized vortices appear in finite-temperature
superfluids, but from the interaction with existing coherent structures in the
turbulent (viscous) normal fluid, rather than due to the intrinsic superfuid
dynamics. In this report we show that, in very intense quantum turbulence
(whose simulation was made possible by a tree algorithm), the vortex tangle
contains small coherent vortical structures (bundles of quantized vortices)

compact Einstein spaces combined with continuation in the dimension of the

This relates (fairly complicated) black hole solutions of EMD theories to
simple black hole/brane solutions of AdS-Maxwell gravity and explains their
properties. The generalized dimensional reduction is used to infer the
holographic dictionary and the hydrodynamic behavior for this class of theories
from those of AdS. As a specific example, we analyze the case of a black brane
carrying a wave whose universal sector is described by gravity coupled to a
Maxwell field and two neutral scalars. At thermal equilibrium and finite
chemical potential the two operators dual to the bulk scalar fields acquire
expectation values characterizing the breaking of conformal and generalized
conformal invariance. We compute holographically the first order transport
coefficients (conductivity, shear and bulk viscosity) for this system.

important role in understanding any intrinsic differences between sources in
different classes. In this respect any clue based on spectral properties will
be very useful toward understanding the mechanisms responsible for the origin
of rapid small scale optical variations, or microvariability. Here we have
added spectra of 46 radio-quiet quasars (RQQSOs) and Seyfert 1 galaxies to
those of our previous sample of 37 such objects, all of which had been
previously searched for microvariability. We took new optical spectra of 33

emission lines were carefully fit to determine line widths (FWHM) as well as
equivalent widths (EW) due to the broad emission line components. The line
widths were used to estimate black hole masses and Eddington ratios, $\ell$.
Both EW and FWHM are anticorrelated with $\ell$. Nearly all trends were in
agreement with our previous work, although the tendency for sources exhibiting
microvariability to be of lower luminosity was not confirmed. Most importantly,
this whole sample of EW distributions provides no evidence for the hypothesis
that a weak jet component in the radio quiet AGNs is responsible for their
microvariability.

emission measure distribution, Emd-app(Te), between temperatures characteristic
of the low transition region and the low corona. The true emission measure
distribution, Emd-t(Te), is determined by the energy balance and geometry
adopted and, with a numerical model, can be used to predict Emd-app(Te), to
guide further modelling. The scaling laws that exist between coronal parameters
arise from the dimensions of the terms in the energy balance equation. Here,
analytical approximations to numerical solutions for Emd-t(Te) are presented,
which show how the constants in the coronal scaling laws are determined. The
apparent emission measure distributions show a minimum value at some
temperature (T0) and a maximum at the mean coronal temperature Tc (although in
some stars, emission from active regions can contribute). It is shown that, for
the energy balance and geometry adopted, the analytical values of the emission
measure and electron pressure at T0 and Tc, depend on only three parameters:
the stellar surface gravity and the values of T0 and Tc. The results are tested
against full numerical solutions for Epsilon Eri (K2 V) and are applied to
Procyon (alpha CMi; F5 IV/V). The analytical approximations can be used to

loss spectra is to introduce a ~10% shift in the peak centroid energy towards
lower channel numbers. The total efficiency is however not affected, showing
that the net result of inclusions is a reduction in the Charge Collection

the emergence of two distinct peaks, both downshifted in channel number. We
note that the observed spectral behavior shows strong similarities with that

Jordan himself inscribed his works (1860-1922). On the other hand, we shall
address the issue of the collectives in which Jordan's works have circulated
(1860-1940). Moreover, the time-period during which Jordan has been publishing
his works, i.e., 1860-1922, provides an opportunity to investigate some
collective organizations of knowledge that pre-existed the development of
object-oriented disciplines such as group theory (Jordan-H\""older theorem),
linear algebra (Jordan's canonical form), topology (Jordan's curve), integral
theory (Jordan's measure), etc. At the time when Jordan was defending his
thesis in 1860, it was common to appeal to transversal organizations of
knowledge, such as what the latter designated as the ""theory of order."" When
Jordan died in 1922, it was however more and more common to point to
object-oriented disciplines as identifying both a corpus of specialized
knowledge and the institutionalized practices of transmissions of a group of

factors are measured, i.e. electron scattering off the bound state, or the
semileptonic weak decay of the bound state. These processes are treated by
means of a coupled-channel framework for a Bakamjian-Thomas type mass operator.
A current with the correct covariance properties is then derived from the
pertinent leading-order electroweak scattering or decay amplitude. As it turns
out, the electromagnetic current is affected by unphysical contributions which
can be traced back to wrong cluster properties inherent in the Bakamjian-Thomas
construction. These spurious contributions, however, can be separated uniquely,
as in the covariant light-front approach. In this way we end up with form
factors which agree with those obtained from the covariant light-front
approach. As an example we will present results for electroweak form factors of
heavy-light systems and discuss the heavy-quark limit which leads to the famous
Isgur-Wise function.

homogeneous relations of degree 2. In this paper we give a sufficient criterion
(called the PVH Criterion) for grK to be quadratic. When K is the group algebra
of a group G, quadraticity is known to be equivalent to the existence of a (not

Criterion also implies the existence of such a universal finite type invariant
for the group G. We apply the PVH Criterion to the group algebra of the pure

the corresponding associated graded algebra is quadratic, and hence that these

mass, M_ej ~ 4.7 M_sol, and total kinetic energy, E_K ~ 11x10^51 ergs. The
ratio of M_Ni to M_ej is ~2 times as large for SN 2010ay as typical GRB-SNe and
may suggest an additional energy reservoir. The metallicity (log(O/H)_PP04 + 12
= 8.19) of the explosion site within the host galaxy places SN 2010ay in the
low-metallicity regime populated by GRB-SNe, and ~0.5(0.2) dex lower than that
typically measured for the host environments of normal (broad-lined) Ic
supernovae. We constrain any gamma-ray emission with E_gamma < 6x10^{48} erg
(25-150 keV) and our deep radio follow-up observations with the Expanded Very
Large Array rule out relativistic ejecta with energy, E > 10^48 erg. We
therefore rule out the association of a relativistic outflow like those which
accompanied SN 1998bw and traditional long-duration GRBs, but place
less-stringent constraints on a weak afterglow like that seen from XRF 060218.
These observations challenge the importance of progenitor metallicity for the
production of a GRB, and suggest that other parameters also play a key role.

nanocavity with timesymmetric single photon pulses. The simulations, based on a
wavefunction approach, reveal that almost perfect single photon absorption
occurs for quantum dot-cavity systems operating on the edge between strong and
weak coupling regime. The computed maximum absorptions probability is close to
unity for pulses with a typical length comparable to the half of the Rabi
period. Furthermore, the dynamic control of the quantum dot energy via electric
fields allows the freezing of the light-matter interaction leaving the quantum
dot in its excited state. Shaping of single photon wavepackets by the electric
field control is limited by the occurrence of chirping of the single photon
pulse. This understanding of the interaction of single photon pulses with the
quantum dot-cavity system provides the basis for the development of advanced
protocols for quantum information processing in the solid state.

seismology and extrasolar planets search. Its surveys of large stellar fields
generate numerous planetary candidates whose lightcurves have transit-like
features. An extensive analytical and observational follow-up effort is

candidates from the CoRoT LRa01 star field in the Monoceros constellation

lasted from 24 October 2007 to 3 March 2008. Methods: 7470 chromatic and 3938
monochromatic lightcurves were acquired and analysed. Instrumental noise and
stellar variability were treated with several filtering tools by different
teams from the CoRoT community. Different transit search algorithms were
applied to the lightcurves. Results: Fifty-one stars were classified as
planetary transit candidates in LRa01. Thirty-seven (i.e., 73 % of all
candidates) are ""good"" planetary candidates based on photometric analysis only.
Thirty-two (i.e., 87 % of the ""good"" candidates) have been followed-up. At the
time of this writing twenty-two cases have been solved and five planets have
been discovered: three transiting hot-Jupiters (CoRoT-5b, CoRoT-12b, and
CoRoT-21b), the first terrestrial transiting planet (CoRoT-7b), and another
planet in the same system (CoRoT-7c, detected by radial velocity survey only).
Evidences of another non-transiting planet in the CoRoT-7 system, namely
CoRoT-7d, have been recently found.

in a gravitational field it is necessary to have an equation which in the
limiting transition to the classical (non-quantum) case corresponds to the
exact Mathisson-Papapetrou equations. According to these equations the spin in
general relativity is Fermi-transported, and the parallel transport of spin is
realized only in some approximation. The traditional general-relativistic Dirac
equation (1929) is based on the parallel transported spinors and does not
ensure the correspondent transition. Second, because in the range of very high
velocity (close to the speed of light) of a spinning particle relative to the
Schwarzschild or Kerr sources the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations have the
solutions which reveal that the spin-gravity interaction acts as a strong
antigravity force, we suppose that this fact can be useful for explanation some
astrophysical phenomena. Some association with the OPERA results is possible.

characterizing stimuli) and a set of several stochastically non-independent
outputs (e.g., random variables describing different aspects of responses), how
can one determine, for each of the outputs, which of the inputs it is
influenced by? The problem has applications ranging from modeling pairwise
comparisons to reconstructing mental processing architectures to conjoint
testing. A necessary and sufficient condition for a given pattern of selective
influences is provided by the Joint Distribution Criterion, according to which
the problem of ""what influences what"" is equivalent to that of the existence of
a joint distribution for a certain set of random variables. For inputs and
outputs with finite sets of values this criterion translates into a test of
consistency of a certain system of linear equations and inequalities (Linear
Feasibility Test) which can be performed by means of linear programming. While
new in the behavioral context, both this test and the Joint Distribution
Criterion on which it is based have been previously proposed in quantum
physics, in dealing with generalizations of Bell inequalities for the quantum
entanglement problem. The parallels between this problem and that of selective
influences in behavioral sciences is established by observing that noncommuting
measurements in quantum physics are mutually exclusive and can therefore be
treated as different levels of one and the same factor.

resistive modes is determined by semi-collisional electron dynamics and is much
less than the ion Larmor radius. Firstly a dispersion relation valid in this
regime is derived which provides a unified description of drift-tearing modes,
kinetic Alfven waves and the internal kink mode at low beta. Tearing mode
stability is investigated analytically recovering the stabilising ion orbit
effect, obtained previously by Cowley et al. [Phys. Fluids (29) 3230 1986],
which implies large values of the tearing mode stability parameter ""Delta
prime"" are required for instability. Secondly, at high beta it is shown that
the tearing mode interacts with the kinetic Alfven wave and that there is an
absolute stabilisation for all ""Delta prime"" due to the shielding effects of
the electron temperature gradients, extending the result of Drake et. al [Phys.
Fluids (26) 2509 1983] to large ion orbits. The nature of the transition
between these two limits at finite values of beta is then elucidated. The low
beta formalism is also relevant to the m=n=1 tearing mode and the dissipative
internal kink mode, thus extending the work of Pegoraro et al. [Phys. Fluids B
(1) 364 1989] to a more realistic electron model incorporating temperature
perturbations, but then the smallness of the dissipative internal kink mode
frequency is exploited to obtain a new dispersion relation valid at arbitrary
beta. A diagram describing the stability of both the tearing mode and
dissipative internal kink mode, in the space of ""Delta prime"" and beta, is
obtained. The trajectory of the evolution of the current profile during a
sawtooth period can be plotted in this diagram, providing a model for the
triggering of a sawtooth crash.

c-C3H2, and HCO in the Horsehead Nebula have shown these species to have higher
abundances towards the edge of the source than towards the center.
  Aims: Given the determination of a wide range of values for zeta (s-1), the
total ionization rate of hydrogen atoms, and the proposal of a column-dependent
zeta(N_H), where N_H is the total column of hydrogen nuclei, we desire to
determine if the effects of zeta(N_H) in a single object with spatial variation
can be observable. We chose the Horsehead Nebula because of its geometry and
high density.
  Method: We model the Horsehead Nebula as a near edge-on photon dominated
region (PDR), using several choices for zeta, both constant and as a function
of column. The column-dependent zeta functions are determined by a Monte Carlo
model of cosmic ray penetration, using a steep power-law spectrum and
accounting for ionization and magnetic field effects. We consider a case with
low-metal elemental abundances as well as a sulfur-rich case.
  Results: We show that use of a column-dependent zeta(N_H) of 5(-15) s-1 at
the surface and 7.5(-16) s-1 at Av = 10 on balance improves agreement between
measured and theoretical molecular abundances, compared with constant values of
zeta.

cosmological model has been studied in general relativity in the presence of
two minimally interacting fluids; a perfect fluid as the matter fluid and a
hypothetical anisotropic fluid as the dark energy fluid. The Einstein's field
equations have been solved by applying two kinematical ans\""{a}tze: we have
assumed the variation law for the mean Hubble parameter that yields a constant
value of deceleration parameter, and one of the components of the shear tensor
has been considered proportional to the mean Hubble parameter. We have
particularly dwelled on the accelerating models with non-divergent expansion
anisotropy as the Universe evolves. Yielding anisotropic pressure, the fluid we
consider in the context of dark energy, can produce results that can be
produced in the presence of isotropic fluid in accordance with the \Lambda CDM
cosmology. However, the derived model gives additional opportunities by being
able to allow kinematics that cannot be produced in the presence of fluids that
yield only isotropic pressure. We have obtained well behaving cases where the
anisotropy of the expansion and the anisotropy of the fluid converge to finite
values (include zero) in the late Universe. We have also showed that although
the metric we consider is totally anisotropic, the anisotropy of the dark
energy is constrained to be axially symmetric, as long as the overall energy
momentum tensor possesses zero shear stress.

This system admits a variety of exact solutions (we focus on solitons), which
are subject to a specific subexponential instability. We demonstrate that the
application of a ""management"", in the form of periodic simultaneous switch of
the sign of the gain, loss, and inter-coupling, effectively stabilizes
solitons, without destroying the supersymmetry. The management turns the
solitons into attractors, for which an attraction basin is identified. The
initial amplitude asymmetry and phase mismatch between the components
transforms the solitons into quasi-stable breathers.

branch, whose metric is inversely proportional to the total area of the Riemann

us a genuine 4d theory, can involve a Wigner-Inonu contraction of global
symmetries of the six-dimensional theory. We show how this explains why
subgroups of SU(N) can appear as the gauge group in the 4d limit. As a
by-product we suggest that half-BPS codimension-two defects in the

the attractive gravity of matter, there exists in our universe some other form
of energy (dark energy or cosmological constant) producing a repulsive force.
The natural interpretation of dark energy is the vacuum energy. However, the
density of vacuum energy expected by the quantum field theory is 120 orders of
magnitude larger than what is allowed by cosmological observations, which is
called the cosmological constant problem and remains one of the most
significant unsolved problems in fundamental physics. Here we show that the
huge discrepancy can be resolved by assuming that our universe is an
attraction-repulsion coupled system with energy conservation, and that the
pre-inflation vacuum is in equilibrium between attraction and repulsion (in
flat Minkowski spacetime, not de Sitter or anti de Sitter). The
attraction-repulsion coupling picture can also easily explain why both kinds of
energy in our universe have similar magnitude today, and avoid singularity
problems in general relativity and cosmology.

velocity change has increased at higher velocity values. This increase has been
predicted in principle in the framework of special theory of relativity.
However, any comparison of the corresponding prediction with experimental data
obtained already in the first half of the past century has not been provided
until now.It will be shown in the presented paper that quite arbitrary inertia
mass increase with velocity may be described also in the framework of the
classical physics on the basis of Hamilton's equations if the force law of
Newton will be generalized; i.e., if time change of particle momentum (not
directly acceleration) will be determined by corresponding force. More general
velocity-dependent formulas (containing some free parameters) for kinetic
energy, momentum and force will be then derived. It will be further shown that
this generalized Hamiltonian mechanics describing general mass increase with
velocity may be reduced to known result of classical physics of Newton if mass
value is taken to be constant, and also that the result of special theory of
relativity may be derived if the given increasing function is taken as
predicted in this theory.

"1110.3068","Robert Simon","Robert Samuel Simon","Locally Finite Knowledge Structures",,,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a game of incomplete information, an infinite state space can create
problems. When the space is uncountably large, the strategy spaces of the
players may be unwieldly, resulting in a lack of measurable equilibria. When
the knowledge of a player allows for an infinite number of possibilities,
without conditions on the behavior of the other players, that player may be
unable to evaluate and compare the payoff consequences of her actions. We argue
that local finiteness is an important and desirable property, namely that at
every point in the state space every player knows that only a finite number of
points are possible. Local finiteness implies a kind of common knowledge of a
countable number of points. Unfortunately its relationship to other forms of
common knowledge is complex. In the context of the multi-agent propositional
calculus, if the set of formulas held in common knowledge is generated by a
finite set of formulas but a finite structure is not determined then there are
uncountably many locally finite structures sharing this same set of formulas in
common knowledge and likewise uncountably many with uncountable size. This
differs radically from the infinite generation of formulas in common knowledge,
and we show some examples of this. One corollary is that if there are
infinitely many distinct points but a uniform bound on the number of points any
player knows is possible then the set of formulas in common knowledge cannot be
finitely generated.
