random frequencies $P_k=W_1... W_{k-1}(1-W_k)$, where $(W_k)_{k\in\mn}$ are
independent copies of a random variable $W$ taking values in $(0,1)$. Assuming
that the number of balls equals $n$, let $L_n$ denote the number of empty boxes
within the occupancy range. In the paper we investigate convergence in
distribution of $L_n$ in the two cases which remained open after the previous
studies. In particular, provided that $\me |\log W|=\me |\log (1-W)|=\infty$
and that the law of $W$ assigns comparable masses to the neighborhoods of 0 and
1, it is shown that $L_n$ weakly converges to a geometric law. This result is
derived as a corollary to a more general assertion concerning the number of
zero decrements of nonincreasing Markov chains. In the case that $\me |\log
W|<\infty$ and $\me |\log (1-W)|=\infty$ we derive several further possible
modes of convergence in distribution of $L_n$. It turns out that the class of
possible limiting laws for, properly normalized and centered, $L_n$ includes
normal laws and spectrally negative stable laws with finite mean. While
investigating the second problem we develop some general results concerning the
weak convergence of renewal shot-noise processes. This allows us to answer a
question asked in Mikosch and Resnick (2006).

subsequence that converges to a complete limiting Ricci flow. A widely quoted
extension of this result allows the curvature to be bounded uniformly only in a
local sense. However, in this note we give a counterexample.

expression data, and secondary data sources, such as protein-protein
interaction networks, have been proposed for predicting outcome in breast
cancer. In these approaches, new composite features are typically constructed
by aggregating the expression levels of several genes. The secondary data
sources are employed to guide this aggregation. Although many studies claim
that these approaches improve classification performance over single gene
classifiers, the gain in performance is difficult to assess. This stems mainly
from the fact that different breast cancer data sets and validation procedures
are employed to assess the performance. Here we address these issues by
employing a large cohort of six breast cancer data sets as benchmark set and by
performing an unbiased evaluation of the classification accuracies of the
different approaches. Contrary to previous claims, we find that composite
feature classifiers do not outperform simple single gene classifiers. We
investigate the effect of (1) the number of selected features; (2) the specific
gene set from which features are selected; (3) the size of the training set and
(4) the heterogeneity of the data set on the performance of composite feature
and single gene classifiers. Strikingly, we find that randomization of
secondary data sources, which destroys all biological information in these
sources, does not result in a deterioration in performance of composite feature
classifiers. Finally, we show that when a proper correction for gene set size
is performed, the stability of single gene sets is similar to the stability of
composite feature sets. Based on these results there is currently no reason to
prefer prognostic classifiers based on composite features over single gene
classifiers for predicting outcome in breast cancer.

rotations depend on the height and direction of the SD. The oscillations of
local density of states (LDOS) are characterized by a wave vector connecting
two points on the hexagonal constant-energy contour at higher energies. The
period of the oscillation caused by the SD along y axis is $\sqrt 3$

positive (negative) bias voltage. With increasing the bias voltage, the period
of the oscillation, insensitive to the strength of the SD, becomes smaller. At
lower energies near the Fermi surface, the two types of wave vectors coexist in
the LDOS modulations. These results are consistent qualitatively with recent

has gained lots of momentum. This includes revisiting the performance of
classic pairwise models with closures at the level of pairs and/or triples as
well as effective-degree-type models and those based on the probability
generating function formalism. In this paper, for a fully connected graph and
the simple $SIS$ (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemic model, a novel
closure is introduced. This is done via using the equations for the moments of
the distribution describing the number of infecteds at all times combined with
the empirical observations that this is well described/approximated by a
binomial distribution with time dependent parameters. This assumption allows us
to express higher order moments in terms of lower order ones and this leads to
a new closure. The significant feature of the new closure is that the
difference of the exact system, given by the Kolmogorov equations, from the
solution of the newly defined approximate system is of order $1/N^2$. This is
in contrast with the $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ difference corresponding to the
approximate system obtained via the classic triple closure.

anomalous behavior, often referred to as anomaly detection. In most anomaly
detection algorithms, the dissimilarity between data samples is calculated by a
single criterion, such as Euclidean distance. However, in many cases there may
not exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous
patterns. In such a case, multiple criteria can be defined, and one can test
for anomalies by scalarizing the multiple criteria using a linear combination
of them. If the importance of the different criteria are not known in advance,
the algorithm may need to be executed multiple times with different choices of
weights in the linear combination. In this paper, we introduce a novel
non-parametric multi-criteria anomaly detection method using Pareto depth
analysis (PDA). PDA uses the concept of Pareto optimality to detect anomalies
under multiple criteria without having to run an algorithm multiple times with
different choices of weights. The proposed PDA approach scales linearly in the
number of criteria and is provably better than linear combinations of the

regulating cellular fate activities such as proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis. Their fundamental importance has attracted considerable attention on
different aspects of the MAPK signaling dynamics; this is particularly true for
the Erk/Mek system, which has become the canonical example for MAPK signaling
systems. Erk exists in many different isoforms, of which the most widely
studied are Erk1 and Erk2. Until recently, these two kinases were considered
equivalent as they differ only subtly at the sequence level; however, these
isoforms exhibit radically different trafficking between cytoplasm and nucleus.
Here we use spatially resolved data on Erk1/2 to develop and analyze
spatio-temporal models of these cascades; and we discuss how sensitivity
analysis can be used to discriminate between mechanisms. We are especially
interested in understanding why two such similar proteins should co-exist in
the same organism, as their functional roles appear to be different. Our models
elucidate some of the factors governing the interplay between processes and the
Erk1/2 localization in different cellular compartments, including competition
between isoforms. This methodology is applicable to a wide range of systems,
such as activation cascades, where translocation of species occurs via signal
pathways. Furthermore, our work may motivate additional emphasis for
considering potentially different roles for isoforms that differ subtly at the

it to contribute a significant amount of flux to spatially unresolved infrared

Earth's atmosphere is absorbing. We have paired the NASA Astrobiology
Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional spectral Earth model
with a model of the phase dependent IR spectrum of a Moonlike satellite to
investigate the effects of an unresolved companion on IR observations of
Earthlike extrasolar planets. For an extrasolar twin Earth-Moon system observed
at full phase at IR wavelengths, the Moon consistently comprises about 20% of
the total signal, approaches 30% of the signal in the 9.6 micron ozone band and
the 15 micron carbon dioxide band, makes up as much as 80% of the total signal
in the 6.3 micron water band, and more than 90% of the signal in the 4.3 micron
carbon dioxide band. These excesses translate to inferred brightness
temperatures for Earth that are too large by about 20-40 K, and demonstrate
that the presence of an undetected satellite can have a significant impact on
the spectroscopic characterization of terrestrial exoplanets. The thermal flux
contribution from an airless companion depends strongly on the
star-planet-observer angle (i.e., the phase angle), allowing moons to mimic or
mask seasonal variations in the host planet's IR spectrum, and implying that
observations of exoplanets should be taken when the phase angle is as small as
feasibly possible if contributions from airless companions are to be minimized.
We show that, by differencing IR observations of an Earth twin with a companion
taken at both gibbous phase and at crescent phase, Moonlike satellites may be
detectable by future exoplanet characterization missions for a wide range of
system inclinations.

These
objects show optical outbursts which are thought to be related to runaway
accretion onto the star. In a previous study we observed in-situ crystal
formation in the disk of EX Lup during its latest outburst in 2008, making the
object an ideal laboratory to investigate circumstellar crystal formation and
transport. This outburst was monitored by a campaign of ground-based and
Spitzer Space Telescope observations. Here we modeled the spectral energy
distribution of EX Lup in the outburst from optical to millimeter wavelengths
with a 2D radiative transfer code. Our results showed that the shape of the SED
at optical wavelengths was more consistent with a single temperature blackbody
than a temperature distribution. We also found that this single temperature
component emitted 80-100 % of the total accretion luminosity. We concluded that
a thermal instability, the most widely accepted model of EXor outbursts, was
likely not the triggering mechanism of the 2008 outburst of EX Lup. Our
mid-infrared Spitzer spectra revealed that the strength of all crystalline
bands between 8 and 30 um increased right after the end of the outburst. Six
months later, however, the crystallinity in the 10 um silicate feature complex
decreased. Our modeling of the mid-infrared spectral evolution of EXLup showed
that, although vertical mixing should be stronger during the outburst than in
the quiescent phase, fast radial transport of crystals (e.g., by stellar/disk
wind) was required to reproduce the observed mid-infrared spectra.

has been elusive. Through in situ transmission electron microscopy, we image
the real-time formation and evolution of the filament in a silicon oxide
resistive switch. The electroforming process is revealed to involve the local
enrichment of silicon from the silicon oxide matrix. Semi-metallic silicon
nanocrystals with structural variations from the conventional diamond cubic
form of silicon are observed, which likely accounts for the conduction in the
filament. The growth and shrinkage of the silicon nanocrystals in response to
different electrical stimuli show energetically viable transition processes in
the silicon forms, offering evidence to the switching mechanism. The study here
also provides insights into the electrical breakdown process in silicon oxide
layers, which are ubiquitous in a host of electronic devices.

$H$-coloring} of $G$, is an adjacency preserving map from the vertex set of $G$
to the vertex set of $H$. Writing ${\rm hom}(G,H)$ for the number of
$H$-colorings admitted by $G$, we conjecture that for any simple finite graph
$H$ (perhaps with loops) and any simple finite $n$-vertex, $d$-regular,
loopless graph $G$ we have $$ {\rm hom}(G,H) \leq \max{{\rm
hom}(K_{d,d},H)^{\frac{n}{2d}}, {\rm hom}(K_{d+1},H)^{\frac{n}{d+1}}} $$ where
$K_{d,d}$ is the complete bipartite graph with $d$ vertices in each partition
class, and $K_{d+1}$ is the complete graph on $d+1$ vertices.
  Results of Zhao confirm this conjecture for some choices of $H$ for which the
maximum is achieved by ${\rm hom}(K_{d,d},H)^{n/2d}$. Here we exhibit
infinitely many non-trivial triples $(n,d,H)$ for which the conjecture is true
and for which the maximum is achieved by ${\rm hom}(K_{d+1},H)^{n/(d+1)}$.
  We also give sharp estimates for ${\rm hom}(K_{d,d},H)$ and ${\rm
hom}(K_{d+1},H)$ in terms of some structural parameters of $H$. This allows us
to characterize those $H$ for which ${\rm hom}(K_{d,d},H)^{1/2d}$ is eventually
(for all sufficiently large $d$) larger than ${\rm hom}(K_{d+1},H)^{1/(d+1)}$
and those for which it is eventually smaller, and to show that this dichotomy
covers all non-trivial $H$. Our estimates also allow us to obtain asymptotic
evidence for the conjecture in the following form. For fixed $H$, for all
$d$-regular $G$ we have $$ {\rm hom}(G,H)^{\frac{1}{|V(G)|}} \leq
(1+o(1))\max{{\rm hom}(K_{d,d},H)^{\frac{1}{2d}}, {\rm
hom}(K_{d+1},H)^{\frac{1}{d+1}}} $$ where $o(1)\rightarrow 0$ as $d \rightarrow

propagation between CERN and the LNGS. Cohen and Glashow argued that such
neutrinos should lose energy by producing photons and e+e- pairs, through Z0
mediated processes analogous to Cherenkov radiation. In terms of the parameter
delta=(v^2_nu-v^2_c)/v^2_c, the OPERA result implies delta = 5 x 10^-5. For
this value of \delta a very significant deformation of the neutrino energy
spectrum and an abundant production of photons and e+e- pairs should be
observed at LNGS. We present an analysis based on the 2010 and part of the 2011
data sets from the ICARUS experiment, located at Gran Sasso National Laboratory
and using the same neutrino beam from CERN. We find that the rates and
deposited energy distributions of neutrino events in ICARUS agree with the
expectations for an unperturbed spectrum of the CERN neutrino beam. Our results
therefore refute a superluminal interpretation of the OPERA result according to
the Cohen and Glashow prediction for a weak current analog to Cherenkov
radiation. In particular no superluminal Cherenkov like e+e- pair or gamma
emission event has been directly observed inside the fiducial volume of the
""bubble chamber like"" ICARUS TPC-LAr detector, setting the much stricter limit
of delta < 2.5 10^-8 at the 90% confidence level, comparable with the one due
to the observations from the SN1987A.

We determine the induced gravito-static polarization constants (electric Love

namely the induced mass multipole as a result of an external gravitational
field. We demonstrate that in 4d these constants vanish thereby settling a
disagreement in the literature. Yet in higher dimensions these constants are
non-vanishing, thereby disproving (at least in d>4) speculations that black
holes have no effective couplings beyond the point particle action. In
particular, when l/(d-3) is half integral these constants demonstrate a
(classical) renormalization flow consistent with the divergences of the
effective field theory. In some other cases the constants are negative
indicating a novel non-spherical instability.

scattering by thermal electrons provided the wave energy density is large
enough. Nonlinear scattering can substantially change the direction of the wave
vector of whistler waves and hence the direction of energy flux with only a
small change in the frequency. A portion of whistler waves return to the
ionosphere with a smaller perpendicular wave vector resulting in diminished
linear damping and enhanced ability to pitch-angle scatter trapped electrons.
In addition, a portion of the scattered wave packets can be reflected near the
ionosphere back into the magnetosphere. Through multiple nonlinear scatterings

pitch-angle scatter trapped electrons. The primary consequence on the Earth's

function of the $m$ most recent increments and sample values. Since only past
samples are used in computing time increments, it is not necessary to save
sampling times (time stamps) for use in the reconstruction process. We focus on
two TANS schemes for discrete-time stochastic signals: a greedy method, and a
method based on dynamic programming. We analyze the performances of these
schemes by computing (or bounding) their trade-offs between sampling rate and
expected reconstruction distortion for autoregressive and Markovian signals.
Simulation results support the analysis of the sampling schemes. We show that,
by opportunistically adapting to local signal characteristics, TANS may lead to
improved power efficiency in some applications.

measurements. Our sample consists of 2812 candidate galaxies at z > 3.5,
including 113 at z = 7 to 8. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution
to a suite of synthetic stellar population models, and measure the value of the
UV spectral slope (beta) from the best-fit model spectrum. The median value of
beta evolves significantly from -1.82 (+0.00,-0.04) at z = 4, to -2.37
(+0.26,-0.06) at z = 7. Additionally, we find that faint galaxies at z = 7 have
beta = -2.68 (+0.39,-0.24) (~ -2.4 after correcting for observational bias);
this is redder than previous claims in the literature, and does not require
""exotic"" stellar populations to explain their colors. This evolution can be
explained by an increase in dust extinction, with the timescale consistent with
low-mass AGB stars forming the bulk of the dust. We find no significant (<
2-sigma) correlation between beta and M_UV when measuring M_UV at a consistent
rest-frame wavelength of 1500 A. This is particularly true at bright
magnitudes, though our results do show evidence for a weak correlation at faint
magnitudes when galaxies in the HUDF are considered separately, hinting that
dynamic range in sample luminosities may play a role. We do find a strong
correlation between beta and the stellar mass at all redshifts, in that more
massive galaxies exhibit redder colors. The most massive galaxies in our sample
have red colors at each redshift, implying that dust can build up quickly in
massive galaxies, and that feedback is likely removing dust from low-mass
galaxies at z > 7. Thus the stellar-mass - metallicity relation, previously
observed up to z ~ 3, may extend out to z = 7 - 8.

rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity and galaxy
structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z=2.2 to the present day in
the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3e10M_sun reported by
others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have
concentrated light profiles, as parametrized by the Sersic index, and the
population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the
joint distribution of star formation activity, Sersic index, stellar mass,
inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence
correlates poorly with stellar mass at all z<2.2. Quiescence correlates well
with Sersic index at all redshifts. Quiescence correlates well with `velocity
dispersion' and stellar surface density at z>1.3, and somewhat less well at
lower redshifts. Yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence and
galaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominent
bulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominated
galaxies have significant star formation. Noting the rarity of quiescent
galaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (and
perhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important condition
for quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10Gyr, in
qualitative agreement with the AGN feedback paradigm.

\sim0.5-2.0 and declines thereafter. The redshift of the peak in the density is
luminosity dependent, with more luminous sources peaking at earlier times; thus
the LF of {\gamma}-ray FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution
similarly to that of radio-quiet AGN. Also using data from the Swift Burst
Alert Telescope we derive the average spectral energy distribution of FSRQs in
the 10 keV-100 GeV band and show that there is no correlation of the peak

uncertainty) in the 0.1-100GeV band. Finally we determine the LF of unbeamed

supernovae (SNeIa) is investigated using early-time spectroscopy obtained by
the CSP. The tell-tale signature of pristine material from a C+O white dwarf
progenitor star is the presence of carbon. The most prominent carbon lines in
optical spectra of SNeIa are due to C II. We find that at least 30% of the
objects in the sample show an absorption at ~6300 AA which is attributed to C
II 6580. An association to H_alpha is considered to be unlikely. These findings
imply a larger incidence of carbon in SNeIa ejecta than previously noted. We
show how observational biases and physical conditions may hide these C II
lines, and account for the scarcity of previous carbon detections. This
relatively large frequency of carbon detections has crucial implications on our
understanding of the explosive process. The observations indicate that carbon
is present merely ~1000 km s^-1 above the bulk of Si II. Spectral modeling
shows the detections are consistent with a mass of carbon of 10^-3--10^-2
M_sun. This would imply substantial mixing, which may be related to asymmetries
of the flame propagation or clumps of unburned material along the line of
sight. However, the uniformity of the relation between C II and Si II
velocities is not consistent with the latter scenario. The observational
properties of SNeIa with and without carbon signatures are compared. A trend
toward bluer color and lower luminosity is found for objects with carbon.

molecular gas mass requires the use of a conversion factor (Xco). While in the
Milky Way this quantity does not appear to vary significantly, there is good
reason to believe that Xco will depend on the larger-scale galactic
environment. Utilising numerical models, we investigate how varying
metallicities, gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in galaxies impact the
way CO line emission traces the underlying H2 gas mass, and under what
circumstances Xco may differ from the Galactic mean value. We find that, due to
the combined effects of increased gas temperature and velocity dispersion, Xco
is depressed below the Galactic mean in high surface density environments such
as ULIRGs. In contrast, in low metallicity environments, Xco tends to be higher
than in the Milky Way, due to photodissociation of CO in metal-poor clouds. At
higher redshifts, gas-rich discs may have gravitationally unstable clumps which
are warm (due to increased star formation) and have elevated velocity
dispersions. These discs tend to have Xco values ranging between present-epoch
gas-rich mergers and quiescent discs at low-z. This model shows that on
average, mergers do have lower Xco values than disc galaxies, though there is
significant overlap. Xco varies smoothly with the local conditions within a
galaxy, and is not a function of global galaxy morphology. We combine our
results to provide a general fitting formula for Xco as a function of CO line
intensity and metallicity. We show that replacing the traditional approach of
using one constant Xco for starbursts and another for discs with our best-fit
function produces star formation laws that are continuous rather than bimodal,
and that have significantly reduced scatter.

We study both linear and non-linear deformations of four-dimensional de Sitter

conformal metric and trace of the extrinsic curvature unchanged for a fixed
hypersurface. This hypersurface is either timelike within the static patch or
spacelike in the future diamond. We require the deformations to be regular at
the future horizon of the static patch observer. For linearized perturbations
in the future diamond, this corresponds to imposing incoming flux solely from
the future horizon of a single static patch observer. When the slices are
arbitrarily close to the cosmological horizon, the finite deformations are
characterized by solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation for
both spacelike and timelike hypersurfaces. We then study, at the level of
linearized gravity, the change in the discrete dispersion relation as we push
the timelike hypersurface toward the worldline of the static patch. Finally, we
study the spectrum of linearized solutions as the spacelike slices are pushed
to future infinity and relate our calculations to analogous ones in the context

straggler stars are typically observed to be brighter and bluer than
hydrogen-burning main-sequence stars, and therefore should already have evolved
into giant stars and stellar remnants. Correlations between blue straggler
frequency and cluster binary fraction, core mass, and radial position suggest
that mass transfer or mergers in binary stars dominates the production of blue
stragglers in open clusters. Analytic models, detailed observations, and
sophisticated N-body simulations, however, argue in favor of stellar
collisions. Here we report that the blue stragglers in long-period binaries in
the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 have companions with masses of about half
a solar mass, with a surprisingly narrow mass distribution. This conclusively
rules out a collisional origin, as the collision hypothesis predicts a
companion-mass distribution with significantly higher masses. Mergers in
hierarchical triple stars are marginally permitted by the data, but the
observations do not favor this hypothesis. The data are closely consistent with
a mass transfer origin for the long-period blue straggler binaries in NGC 188,
in which the companions would be white dwarfs of about half a solar mass.

z=1.62 proto-cluster using near-IR imaging data from Hubble Space Telescope
Wide Field Camera 3 data of the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic
Legacy Survey (CANDELS). The cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphology
relation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally have
morphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistent
with ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. The size
distribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact (<
1kpc), massive galaxies compared to CANDELS field galaxies at z=1.6. As a
result the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizes
compared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90% significance.
Combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent cluster
galaxies is relatively slow from z~1.6 to the present, growing as
(1+z)^(-0.6+/-0.1). If this result is generalizable, then it implies that
physical processes associated with the denser cluster region seems to have
caused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z=1.6 and slower
subsequent growth at z<1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. The
quiescent cluster galaxies at z=1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lower
redshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggest
that they contain extended stellar disks. We argue the cluster galaxies require
dissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or ""dry"") mergers to reorganize the disk
material and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, and
color of early-type galaxies in z<1 clusters.

we show that for any finite speed v with c<v<infinity, such models predict
correlations that can be exploited for faster-than-light communication. This
superluminal communication does not require access to any hidden physical
quantities, but only the manipulation of measurement devices at the level of
our present-day description of quantum experiments. Hence, assuming the
impossibility of using nonlocal correlations for superluminal communication, we
exclude any possible explanation of quantum correlations in terms of influences
propagating at any finite speed. Our result uncovers a new aspect of the
complex relationship between multipartite quantum nonlocality and the
impossibility of signalling.

determines the chirality of the quarks which produced them. Information about
the top spins can be extracted by measuring the angular distribution of the

distribution, the threshold lepton asymmetry, vanishes in tree-level QCD but is
non-zero if new physics modifies the relative contribution of right-handed and

realistic models addressing the anomalous ttbar asymmetry have chiral couplings

covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory renormalized in the

in the chiral expansion, systematically includes the effects of the
$\Delta(1232)$ in the $\delta$-counting, has the right analytic properties and
is renormalization-scale independent. This approach overcomes the limitations
that previous chiral analyses of the $\pi N$ scattering amplitude had,
providing an accurate description of the partial wave phase shifts of the
Karlsruhe-Helsinki and George-Washington groups up to energies just below the
resonance region. We also study the solution of the Matsinos group which
focuses on the parameterization of the data at low energies. Once the values of
the low-energy constants are determined by adjusting the center-of-mass energy
dependence of the amplitude to the scattering data, we obtain predictions on
different observables. In particular, we extract an accurate value for the
pion-nucleon sigma term, $ \sigma_{\pi N}$. This allows us to avoid the usual
method of extrapolation to the unphysical region of the amplitude. Our study
indicates that the inclusion of modern meson-factory and pionic-atom data

high-resolution HST/WFC3 and ACS images enable us to resolve structures of z~2
galaxies down to kpc scale in the rest-frame UV and optical bands as well as to
detect clumps toward the faint end. The physical properties of clumps are
measured through fitting spatially resolved seven-band (BVizYJH) spectral
energy distribution to models. On average, the clumps are blue and have similar
median rest-frame UV--optical color as the diffuse components of their host
galaxies, but the clumps have large scatter in their colors. Although the star
formation rate (SFR)--stellar mass relation of galaxies is dominated by the
diffuse components, clumps emerge as regions with enhanced specific SFRs,
contributing individually ~10% and together ~50% of the SFR of the host
galaxies. However, the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV/optical
luminosity and stellar mass are smaller, typically a few percent individually
and ~20% together. On average, clumps are younger by 0.2 dex and denser by a
factor of 8 than diffuse components. Clump properties have obvious radial
variations in the sense that central clumps are redder, older, more extincted,
denser, and less active on forming stars than outskirts clumps. Our results are
broadly consistent with a widely held view that clumps are formed through
gravitational instability in gas-rich turbulent disks and would eventually
migrate toward galactic centers and coalesce into bulges. Roughly 40% of the
galaxies in our sample contain a massive clump that could be identified as a
proto-bulge, which seems qualitatively consistent with such a bulge-formation
scenario.

designed to select both star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and passively-evolving
galaxies (PEGs) at 2.3<z<3.5 by using rest-frame UV--optical (V-J vs. J-L)
colors. The criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar population
synthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to evaluate
their efficiency and contamination. We apply the well-tested VJL criteria to
the HST/WFC3 Early Release Science field and study the physical properties of
selected galaxies. The redshift distribution of selected SFGs peaks at z~2.7,
slightly lower than that of Lyman Break Galaxies at z~3. Comparing the observed
mid-infrared fluxes of selected galaxies with the prediction of pure stellar
emission, we find that our VJL method is effective at selecting massive dusty
SFGs that are missed by the Lyman Break Technique. About half of the star
formation in massive (M_{star}>10^{10}M_{Sun}) galaxies at 2.3<z<3.5 is
contributed by dusty (extinction E(B-V)>0.4) SFGs, which however, only account
for ~20% of the number density of massive SFGs. We also use the mid-infrared
fluxes to clean our PEG sample, and find that galaxy size can be used as a
secondary criterion to effectively eliminate the contamination of dusty SFGs.
The redshift distribution of the cleaned PEG sample peaks at z~2.5. We find 6
PEG candidates at z>3 and discuss possible methods to distinguish them from
dusty contamination. We conclude that at least part of our candidates are real
PEGs at z~3, implying that this type of galaxies began to form their stars at
z>5. We measure the integrated stellar mass density of PEGs at z~2.5 and set
constraints on it at z>3. We find that the integrated stellar mass density

non-steady mass loss can be one way to explain the spectral diversity of Type
II luminous supernovae (LSNe). The interaction of SN ejecta and wind
surrounding it is considered to be a power source to illuminate LSNe because
many LSNe show the wind signature in their spectra (Type IIn LSNe). However,
there also exist LSNe without the spectral features caused by the wind (Type
IIL LSNe). We show that, even if LSNe are illuminated by the interaction, it is
possible that they do not show the narrow spectra from the wind if we take into
account of non-steady mass loss of their progenitors. When the shock breakout
takes place in the dense wind with the density structure \rho\propto r^{-w},
the ratio of the diffusion timescale in the optically thick region of the wind
(td) and the shock propagation timescale of the entire wind after the shock
breakout (ts) strongly depends on w. For the case w<~1, both timescales are
comparable (td/ts \simeq 1) and td/ts gets smaller as w gets larger. For the
case td/ts\simeq 1, the shock goes through the entire wind just after the light
curve (LC) peak and narrow spectral lines from the wind cannot be observed
after the LC peak (Type IIL LSNe). If td/ts is much smaller, the shock wave
continues to propagate in the wind after the LC peak and unshocked wind remains
(Type IIn LSNe). This difference can be obtained only through a careful
treatment of the shock breakout condition in a dense wind. The lack of narrow
Lorentzian line profiles in Type IIL LSNe before the LC peak can also be
explained by the difference in the density slope. Furthermore, we apply our
model to Type IIn LSN 2006gy and Type IIL LSN 2008es and find that our model is
consistent with the observations.

models that are not matched by RV surveys of mature stars. These targets have
been extremely elusive to date, with no exoplanets younger than 10--20 Myr and
only a handful of direct-imaged exoplanets at all ages. We report the direct
imaging discovery of a likely (proto)planet around the young (~2 Myr) solar
analog LkCa 15, located inside a known gap in the protoplanetary disk (a
""transitional disk""). Our observations use non-redundant aperture masking
interferometry at 3 epochs to reveal a faint and relatively blue point source
($M_K'=9.1+/-0.2, K'-L'=0.98+/-0.22), flanked by approximately co-orbital
emission that is red and resolved into at least two sources (M_L'=7.5+/-0.2,
K'-L'=2.7+/-0.3; M_L'=7.4+/-0.2, K'-L'=1.94+/-0.16). We propose that the most
likely geometry consists of a newly-formed (proto)planet that is surrounded by
dusty material. The nominal estimated mass is ~6 M_{Jup} according to the 1 Myr
hot-start models. However, we argue based on its luminosity, color, and the
presence of circumplanetary material that the planet has likely been caught at
its epoch of assembly, and hence this mass is an upper limit due to its extreme
youth and flux contributed by accretion. The projected separations (71.9 +/-
1.6 mas, 100.7 +/- 1.9 mas, and 88.2 +/- 1.8 mas) and deprojected orbital radii
(16, 21, and 19 AU) correspond to the center of the disk gap, but are too close
to the primary star for a circular orbit to account for the observed inner edge
of the outer disk, so an alternate explanation (i.e., additional planets or an
eccentric orbit) is likely required. This discovery is the first direct
evidence that at least some transitional disks do indeed host newly-formed (or
forming) exoplanetary systems, and the observed properties provide crucial
insight into the gas giant formation process.

deviation from the Standard Model. These parameters were calculated at one loop
in the basis-independent CP-violating Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). The
scalar parameter space of the 2HDM was randomly sampled within limits imposed
by unitarity and found to produce values of the oblique parameters within
experimental bounds, with the exception of T. The experimental limits on T were
used to predict information about the mass of the charged Higgs boson and the
difference in mass between the charged Higgs boson and the heaviest neutral
Higgs boson (m_ch - m_3). In particular, it was found that the 2HDM predicts
-600 GeV < m_ch - m_3 < 100 GeV, with values of m_ch > 250 GeV being preferred.
The mass scale of the new physics produced by random sampling was consistently
fairly high, with the average of the scalar masses falling between 400 and 800
GeV for Y_2 = m_W^2, although the model can be tuned to produce a light neutral
Higgs mass (eg, 120 GeV). Hence, the values produced for V, W, and X fell well
within .01 of zero, confirming the robustness of the linear expansion
approximation. Taking the CP-conserving limit of the model was found to not
significantly affect the values generated for the oblique parameters.

side by a charged black hole. We address the following questions of such a

  1. Does the system have a Fermi surface? What are the properties of low

  2. Does the system have an instability to condensation of scalar operators?
What is the critical behavior near the corresponding quantum critical point?
  We find interesting parallels with those of high T_c cuprates and heavy

regular flutter and tumble motion can be obtained for plates with small and
large Froude numbers respectively. Belmonte et al. (1998) conducted
experimental study on thin flat strips falling in a vertical cell. They
categorized the Froude number at which the transition from fluttering to

dynamic equations based on quasi-steady models. They also found that the fluid
circulation is mainly generated by the plate rotation and its angular velocity.

atmospheric lines as a natural, freely available wavelength reference. Figueira
et al. (2010) measured the RV of O2 lines using HARPS and showed that the
scatter was only of ~10 m/s over a timescale of 6 yr. Using a simple but
physically motivated empirical model, they demonstrated a precision of 2 m/s,
roughly twice the average photon noise contribution. In this paper we take
advantage of a unique opportunity to confirm the sensitivity of the telluric
absorption lines RV to different atmospheric and observing conditions: by means
of contemporaneous in-situ wind measurements by radiosondes.
  The RV model fitting yielded similar results to that of Figueira et al.
(2010), with lower wind magnitude values and varied wind direction. The probes
confirmed the average low wind magnitude and suggested that the average wind
direction is a function of time as well. The two approaches deliver the same
results in what concerns wind magnitude and agree on wind direction when
fitting is done in segments of a couple of hours. Statistical tests show that
the model provides a good description of the data on all timescales, being
always preferable to not fitting any atmospheric variation. The smaller the
timescale on which the fitting can be performed (down to a couple of hours),
the better the description of the real physical parameters. We conclude then
that the two methods deliver compatible results, down to better than 5 m/s and
less than twice the estimated photon noise contribution on O2 lines RV
measurement. However, we cannot rule out that parameters alpha and gamma
(dependence on airmass and zero-point, respectively) have a dependence on time

galaxies in terms of a long-lived wave structure with a constant pattern speed
in order to avoid the winding dilemma. The pattern is consequently a rigidly
rotating, long-lived feature. We run an N-body/SPH simulation of a Milky
Way-sized barred disk, and find that the spiral arms are transient features
whose pattern speeds decrease with radius, in such a way that the pattern speed
is almost equal to the rotation curve of the galaxy. We trace particle motion
around the spiral arms. We show that particles from behind and in front of the
spiral arm are drawn towards and join the arm. Particles move along the arm in
the radial direction and we find a clear trend that they migrate toward the
outer (inner) radii on the trailing (leading) side of the arm. Our simulations
demonstrate that at all radii where there is a co-rotating spiral arm the
particles continue to be accelerated (decelerated) by the spiral arm for long
periods, which leads to strong migration.

centrifugally supported disk occurs during the first $\sim$10 seconds following
the collapse of the iron core in a massive star. This only occurs in a small
fraction of massive stellar deaths, however, and requires unusual conditions. A
much more frequent occurrence could be the death of a star that makes a black
hole and a weak or absent outgoing shock, but in a progenitor that only has
enough angular momentum in its outermost layers to make a disk. We consider
several cases where this is likely to occur - blue supergiants with low mass
loss rates, tidally-interacting binaries involving either helium stars or giant
stars, and the collapse to a black hole of very massive pair-instability
supernovae. These events have in common the accretion of a solar mass or so of
material through a disk over a period much longer than the duration of a common
gamma-ray burst. A broad range of powers is possible, $10^{47}$ to
$10^{50}\,$erg s$^{-1}$, and this brightness could be enhanced by beaming. Such
events were probably more frequent in the early universe where mass loss rates
were lower. Indeed this could be one of the most common forms of gamma-ray
transients in the universe and could be used to study first generation stars.
Several events could be active in the sky at any one time. A recent example of
this sort of event may have been the SWIFT transient Sw-1644+57.

possibility that an action at point A cannot immediately affect what happens at
point B creates the opportunity for spatial nonuniformity. This nonuniformity
must change our understanding of evolutionary dynamics, as the same organism in
different places can have different expected evolutionary outcomes. Since
organism origins and fates are both determined locally, we must consider
heterogeneity explicitly to determine its effects. We use simulations of
spatially extended host--pathogen and predator--prey ecosystems to reveal the
limitations of standard mathematical treatments of spatial heterogeneity. Our
model ecosystem generates heterogeneity dynamically; an adaptive network of
hosts on which pathogens are transmitted arises as an emergent phenomenon. The
structure and dynamics of this network differ in significant ways from those of
related models studied in the adaptive-network field. We use a new technique,
organism swapping, to test the efficacy of both simple approximations and more
elaborate moment-closure methods, and a new measure to reveal the timescale
dependence of invasive-strain behavior. Our results demonstrate the failure not
only of the most straightforward (""mean field"") approximation, which smooths
over heterogeneity entirely, but also of the standard correction (""pair
approximation"") to the mean field treatment. In spatial contexts, invasive
pathogen varieties can prosper initially but perish in the medium term,
implying that the concepts of reproductive fitness and the Evolutionary Stable
Strategy have to be modified for such systems.

to recover $x*$ such that ||x-x*||_p <= C min_{k-sparse x'} ||x-x'||_q for some

  In this paper we show that if one is allowed to perform measurements that are
adaptive, then the number of measurements can be considerably reduced.
Specifically, for $C=1+eps$ and $p=q=2$ we show - A scheme with $m=O((1/eps)k

reactants are initially separated by infinite gradients. We focus on the
initial regime, characterized by a well-defined one-dimensional contact line
between the reactants. The amount of reactant consumed is given by the
diffusive flux along this line, and hence relates directly to its length and to
the gradients along it. We show both theoretically and numerically that the
probability distribution of the modulus of the gradient of the reactants along
this contact line multiplied by {\kappa} does not depend on the diffusion
{\kappa} and can be inferred, after a few turnover times, from the joint
distribution of the finite time Lyapunov exponent {\lambda} and the frequency
1/{\tau} . The equivalent time {\tau} measures the stretching time scale of a
Lagrangian parcel in the recent past, while {\lambda} measures it on the whole
chaotic orbit. At smaller times, we predict the shape of this gradient
distribution taking into account the initial random orientation between the
contact line and the stretching direction. We also show that the probability
distribution of the reactants is proportional to {\kappa} and to the product of
the ensemble mean contact line length with the ensemble mean of the inverse of
the gradient along it. Besides contributing to the understanding of fast
chemistry in chaotic flows, the present study based on a Lagrangian stretching
theory approach provides results that pave the way to the development of
accurate sub- grid parametrizations in models with insufficient resolution for
capturing the length scales relevant to chemical processes, for example in

applications in many diverse areas. The stochastic block model is a common tool
for model-based community detection, and asymptotic tools for checking
consistency of community detection under the block model have been recently
developed. However, the block model is limited by its assumption that all nodes
within a community are stochastically equivalent, and provides a poor fit to
networks with hubs or highly varying node degrees within communities, which are
common in practice. The degree-corrected stochastic block model was proposed to
address this shortcoming and allows variation in node degrees within a
community while preserving the overall block community structure. In this paper
we establish general theory for checking consistency of community detection
under the degree-corrected stochastic block model and compare several community
detection criteria under both the standard and the degree-corrected models. We
show which criteria are consistent under which models and constraints, as well
as compare their relative performance in practice. We find that methods based
on the degree-corrected block model, which includes the standard block model as
a special case, are consistent under a wider class of models and that
modularity-type methods require parameter constraints for consistency, whereas
likelihood-based methods do not. On the other hand, in practice, the degree
correction involves estimating many more parameters, and empirically we find it
is only worth doing if the node degrees within communities are indeed highly
variable. We illustrate the methods on simulated networks and on a network of
political blogs.

to the largest Mathieu group. This may be compared to monstrous moonshine, in
which modular functions are attached to elements of the Monster group. One of
the most remarkable aspects of monstrous moonshine is the following genus zero
property: the modular functions turn out to be the generators for the function
fields of their invariance groups. In particular, these invariance groups
define genus zero quotients of the upper half plane. It is therefore natural to
ask if there is an analogue of this property in the Mathieu case, and at first
glance the answer appears to be negative since not all the discrete groups
arising there have genus zero. On the other hand, in this article we prove that
each (mock) modular form appearing in the Mathieu correspondence coincides with
the Rademacher sum constructed from its polar part. This property, inspired by
the AdS/CFT correspondence in physics, was shown previously to be equivalent to
the genus zero property of monstrous moonshine. Hence we conclude that this
""Rademacher summability"" property serves as the natural analogue of the genus
zero property in the Mathieu case. Our result constitutes further evidence that
the Rademacher method provides a powerful framework for understanding the
modularity of moonshine, and leads to interesting physical questions regarding
the gravitational duals of the relevant conformal field theories.

15 protoplanetary disk at high angular resolution (with a characteristic scale

supplemented by slightly lower resolution observations from the Submillimeter
Array. We fit these data with simple morphological models to characterize the
spectacular ring-like emission structure of this disk. Our analysis indicates
that a small amount of 870 micron dust emission (~5 mJy) originates inside a
large (40-50 AU radius) low optical depth cavity. This result can be
interpreted either in the context of an abrupt decrease by a factor of ~5 in
the radial distribution of millimeter-sized dust grains or as indirect evidence
for a gap in the disk, in agreement with previous inferences from the
unresolved infrared spectrum and scattered light images. A preliminary model
focused on the latter possibility suggests the presence of a low-mass
(planetary) companion, having properties commensurate with those inferred from
the recent discovery of LkCa 15b.

magnetic field strengths of all pulsars, can be well explained by magnetic
field decay with core temperatures of $~2\times10^{8}$ K, $\sim2\times10^{7}$
K, and $\sim10^{5}$ K, for magnetars, normal radio pulsars, and millisecond
pulsars, respectively; assuming that their characteristic ages are about two
orders of magnitude larger than their true ages, the required core temperatures
may be reduced by about a factor of 10. The magnetic decay follows a power-law
and is dominated by the solenoidal component of the ambipolar diffusion mode.
In this model, all NSs are assumed to have the same initial magnetic field
strength, but different core temperature which do not change as the magnetic
field decays. This suggests that the key distinguishing property between
magnetars and normal pulsars is that magnetars were born much hotter than
normal pulsars, and thus have much longer magnetic field decay time scales,
resulting in higher surface magnetic field strength even with the same ages of
normal pulsars. The above conclusion agrees well with the observed correlations
between the surface temperatures of magnetars and other young NSs, which do not
agree with the cooling dominated evolution of neutron stars. This suggests a
possible scenario that heating, perhaps due to magnetic field decay, balances
neutron star cooling for observed pulsars.

Cameron and CO$_2^+$ UV doublet bands have been calculated for dif{}ferent
observations (Viking condition, Mariner and Mars Express SPICAM observations)

using the S2K model are $\sim$40% higher than those calculated using the EUVAC

below 250 \AA\ in the EUVAC model, intensities calculated using EUVAC model are
slightly higher ($\sim$20%) than those calculated using S2K model. Irrespective
of the solar activity condition, production of Cameron band due to

loss of coherency in the {100} direction. Elastic relaxation near surfaces

is the normal direction of quintuple layer of 3D TI (see inset of Fig.1). The
quantized conductance are found to be $<G_{zz}>=1$, $<G_{xx}>=4/3$ and
$<G_{zx}>=6/5$ with corresponding quantized conductance fluctuation 0.54, 0.47,

lesser for sources having steeper spectra (measured near rest-frame 1 GHz). We
argue based on existing theoretical and observational evidence that it is
premature to conclude that the particle acceleration mechanism in sources
having straight, ultra-steep radio spectra gives rise to an ultra-steep
injection spectrum of the radiating electrons. In empirical support to this we
show that the estimated injection spectral indices, available for a
representative sample of 35 compact steep spectrum (CSS) radio sources are not
correlated with their rest-frame (intrinsic) rotation measures, which are known
to be typically large, indicating a dense environment, as is also the case for
high-$z$ radio galaxies.

reveal that the strong and weak gravitational lensing convergence $\kappa$-map
has an $8\sigma$ offset from the $\Sigma$-map. The observed $\Sigma$-map is a
direct measurement of the surface mass density of the Intracluster medium(ICM)
gas. It accounts for 83% of the averaged mass-fraction of the system. This
suggests a modified gravity theory at large distances different from Newton's
inverse-square gravitational law. In this paper, as a cluster scale
generalization of Grumiller's modified gravity model (D. Grumiller, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 105, 211303 (2010)), we present a gravity model with a generalized linear
Rindler potential in Randers-Finslerian spacetime without invoking any dark
matter. The galactic limit of the model is qualitatively consistent with the
MOND and Grumiller's. It yields approximately the flatness of the rotational
velocity profile at the radial distance of several kpcs and gives the velocity
scales for spiral galaxies at which the curves become flattened. Plots of
convergence $\kappa$ for a galaxy cluster show that the peak of the
gravitational potential has chances to lie on the outskirts of the baryonic
mass center. Assuming an isotropic and isothermal ICM gas profile with
temperature $T=14.8$ keV (which is the center value given by observations), we
obtain a good match between the dynamical mass $M_\textmd{T}$ of the main
cluster given by collisionless Boltzmann equation and that given by the King
$\beta$-model. We also consider a Randers+dark matter scenario \textbf{and a
$\Lambda$-CDM model} with the NFW dark matter distribution profile. We find
that a mass ratio $\eta$ between dark matter and baryonic matter about 6 fails
to reproduce the observed convergence $\kappa$-map for the isothermal
temperature $T$ taking the observational center value.

responsible for the ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) and can substitute the
Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson in keeping perturbative unitarity in the
longitudinal WW scattering up to a cut-off \Lambda\approx 4\pi v. These new
states can be sufficiently light to be observed at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) and they can even be the first manifestation of new physics at the LHC.
Their couplings among themselves and with the SM particles, can be described
using reasonable effective Lagrangians and Chiral Perturbation Theory. In the
first part of this thesis different possibilities for a strongly interacting
EWSB are discussed in details with particular attention to the roles of
unitarity in the longitudinal WW scattering and of ElectroWeak Precision Tests
(EWPT). Higgsless models with composite vectors and scalars, based on the
SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}/SU(2)_{L+R} custodial symmetry, are discussed in the
context of ElectroWeak Chiral Lagrangians and the phenomenology of the pair
productions is studied for the high energy and high luminosity phase of the
LHC. In the second part of the thesis the possible signals of single particle
production at the early LHC, with 7 TeV of center of mass energy and 1-5
fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity, are treated with a phenomenological
Lagrangian approach. The final states containing at least one photon emerge as
the most promising channels for an early discovery already with tens of inverse
picobarns of integrated luminosity. Finally, in the last part of this work, the
role of a composite iso-singlet vector in Dark Matter models is discussed and
the related LHC phenomenology is studied, giving particular attention to the
Z\gamma final state.

LogitBoost for classification. Motivated by the statistical view, LogitBoost
can be seen as additive tree regression. Two important factors in this setting
are: 1) coupled classifier output due to a sum-to-zero constraint, and 2) the
dense Hessian matrices that arise when computing tree node split gain and node
value fittings. In general, this setting is too complicated for a tractable
model learning algorithm. However, too aggressive simplification of the setting
may lead to degraded performance. For example, the original LogitBoost is
outperformed by ABC-LogitBoost due to the latter's more careful treatment of
the above two factors.
  In this paper we propose techniques to address the two main difficulties of
the LogitBoost setting: 1) we adopt a vector tree (i.e. each node value is
vector) that enforces a sum-to-zero constraint, and 2) we use an adaptive block
coordinate descent that exploits the dense Hessian when computing tree split
gain and node values. Higher classification accuracy and faster convergence
rates are observed for a range of public data sets when compared to both the
original and the ABC-LogitBoost implementations.

a locally free sheaf over the retract of (M,O) which is called the retract of

the tangent sheaf of a split supermanifold is studied in more details. Then we
study locally free sheaves of modules over projective superspaces. A spectral

the mirror-field system, where a perfectly reflecting mirror is illuminated by
a single-mode coherent state of the massless scalar field. The associated
radiation pressure is described by a surface integral of the stress-tensor of
the field. The read-out field is measured by a monople detector, form which the
effective distance between the detector and mirror can be obtained. In the
slow-motion limit of the mirror, we are able to identify various sources of
quantum noise that lead to uncertainty of the read-out measurement. Since the
mirror is driven by radiation pressure, the sources of noise, other than the
shot nose given by the intrinsic fluctuations of the incident state, may also
result from random motion of mirror due to radiation pressure fluctuations and
from modified field fluctuations induced by the displacement of the mirror.
Correlation between different sources of noise can be established as the
consequence of interference between the incident field and the reflected field
out of the mirror in the read-out measurement. The overall uncertainty is found
to decrease (increase) due to the negative (positive) correlation. In the case
of negative correlation, the uncertainty can be lowered than the value
predicted by the standard quantum limit. We also examine the validity of the
particle number approach, which is often used in quantum optics, and compared
its results with those given by the field theoretical approach. Finally we
discuss the backreaction effects, induced by the radiation pressure, that alter
the dynamics of the mean displacement of the mirror, and we argue this
backreaction can be ignored for a slowly moving mirror.

visualization has recently inspired the development of quality assessment
measures, in order to evaluate the resulting low-dimensional representation
independently from a methods' inherent criteria. Several (existing) quality
measures can be (re)formulated based on the so-called co-ranking matrix, which
subsumes all rank errors (i.e. differences between the ranking of distances
from every point to all others, comparing the low-dimensional representation to
the original data). The measures are often based on the partioning of the
co-ranking matrix into 4 submatrices, divided at the K-th row and column,
calculating a weighted combination of the sums of each submatrix. Hence, the
evaluation process typically involves plotting a graph over several (or even
all possible) settings of the parameter K. Considering simple artificial
examples, we argue that this parameter controls two notions at once, that need
not necessarily be combined, and that the rectangular shape of submatrices is
disadvantageous for an intuitive interpretation of the parameter. We debate
that quality measures, as general and flexible evaluation tools, should have
parameters with a direct and intuitive interpretation as to which specific
error types are tolerated or penalized. Therefore, we propose to replace K with
two parameters to control these notions separately, and introduce a differently
shaped weighting on the co-ranking matrix. The two new parameters can then
directly be interpreted as a threshold up to which rank errors are tolerated,
and a threshold up to which the rank-distances are significant for the
evaluation. Moreover, we propose a color representation of local quality to
visually support the evaluation process for a given mapping, where every point
in the mapping is colored according to its local contribution to the overall
quality.

technique in which ions with energies in the 0.1-10 keV range impact against a
solid target inducing defect creation and dynamics, and eroding its surface
leading to formation of ordered nanostructures. Despite its technological
interest, a basic understanding of nanopattern formation processes occurring
under IBS of amorphizable targets has not been clearly established, recent
experiments on Si having largely questioned knowledge accumulated during the
last two decades. A number of interfacial equations have been proposed in the
past to describe these phenomena, typically by adding together different
contributions coming from surface diffusion, ion sputtering or mass
redistribution, etc. in a non-systematic way. Here, we exploit the general idea

sputtering) can be incorporated, under generic physical conservation laws. As

equivalent to the correlator of a n-cusp null polygonal Wilson loop with the
remaining operator in general position, normalized by the expectation value of
the Wilson loop itself, as recently conjectured by Alday, Buchbinder and

correlators. Finally, we study the natural extension where n operators become
pairwise null separated with k operators in general position. As an example, we
perform an analysis of the resulting correlator for k=2 and discuss some of the

interaction in the hadronic and quark gluon plasma (QGP) phases. The detailed
study of systematics of meson spectra is important also because it acts as
ingredient for estimating the hadronic decay backgrounds in the photon, single
lepton and dilepton spectra which are the penetrating probes of quark gluon
plasma. In this work, we parameterize experimentally measured pion spectra and
then obtain the spectra of other light mesons using a property known as $m_T$
scaling. The $m_{T}$ scaled spectra for each meson is compared with
experimental data for p+p, d+Au and Au+Au systems at $\surd s_{NN} $ = 200 GeV.
The agreement of the $m_{T}$ scaled and experimental data shapes are excellent
in most cases and their fitted relative normalization gives ratio of meson to
pion $m_T$ spectra. These ratios are useful to obtain the hadronic decay
contribution in photonic and leptonic channels but also point to the
quantitative changes in the dynamics of the heavy ion collision over p+p
collisions. It is shown that, the particles with charm contents behave
differently as compared to pions in d+Au systems and particles either with
strange or charm contents behave differently from pions in Au+Au systems. For
Au+Au system, three centrality classes have been studied which reveal that for
the particles like kaon and $\phi$, peripheral collision data is better
reproduced as compared to central and their relative ratios with pions also
increase as the collisions become more central.

In the first few minutes of a newborn neutron star's life the Hall
effect and differential rotation may both be important. We demonstrate that
these two ingredients are sufficient for generating a 'shear-Hall instability'
and for studying its excitation conditions, growth rates, and characteristic
magnetic field patterns.
  Methods. We numerically solve the induction equation in a spherical shell,
with a kinematically prescribed differential rotation profile {\Omega}(s),
where s is the cylindrical radius. The Hall term is linearized about an imposed
uniform axial field. The linear stability of individual azimuthal modes, both
axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric, is then investigated.
  Results. For the shear-Hall instability to occur, the axial field must be
parallel to the rotation axis if {\Omega}(s) decreases outward, whereas if
{\Omega}(s) increases outward it must be anti-parallel. The instability draws
its energy from the differential rotation, and occurs on the short rotational
timescale rather than on the much longer Hall timescale. It operates most
efficiently if the Hall time is comparable to the diffusion time. Depending on
the precise field strengths B0, either axisymmetric or non-axisymmetric modes
may be the most unstable.
  Conclusions. Even if the differential rotation in newborn neutron stars is
quenched within minutes, the shear-Hall instability may nevertheless amplify
any seed magnetic fields by many orders of magnitude.

suggests either that HCl is not the main reservoir of chlorine in the gas

can dramatically alter the physical and chemical properties of (Mg,Fe)O in the
deep mantle, thereby changing our understanding of the Earth's deep interior.
To establish a fundamental understanding of the ground electronic state of
iron, the electronic and magnetic states of Fe2+ in (Mg0.75,Fe0.25)O have been
investigated by transmission (TMS) and synchrotron (NFS) M\""ossbauer
spectroscopy at high pressures and low temperatures (down to 5 K). The results
show that the ground electronic state of Fe2+ at the critical pressure Pc of
the spin transition and close to T=0 is determined by a quantum critical point
Pq (T = 0, Pc) where the energy difference between the HS and LS states (an
energy gap for the spin fluctuation) is zero. The deviation from T=0 leads to
the thermal excitation for the HS or LS state, suggesting a strong influence on
the magnetic and hence the physical properties of the material. Combining these
with theoretical calculations, the results indicate that the existence of the
quantum critical point at zero temperature affects not only the low-temperature
physical properties, but also the strong temperature/pressure-dependent
properties at conditions relevant to the middle layer of the lower mantle.

We show how the build-up of magnetic gradients in the Sun's corona may

  Methods.Assuming an ideal evolution in the corona, and an initially uniform
magnetic field, the subsequent field line mapping is computed by integrating
trajectories of the (time-dependent) horizontal photospheric velocity field.
The method is applied to a 12 hour high-resolution sequence of photospheric
flows derived from Hinode/SOT magnetograms.
  Results. We find the generation of a network of quasi-separatrix layers in
the magnetic field, which correspond to Lagrangian coherent structures in the
photospheric velocity. The visual pattern of these structures arises primarily
from the diverging part of the photospheric flow, hiding the effect of the
rotational flow component: this is demonstrated by a simple analytical model of
photospheric convection. We separate the diverging and rotational components
from the observed flow and show qualitative agreement with purely diverging and
rotational models respectively. Increasing the flow speeds in the model
suggests that our observational results are likely to give a lower bound for
the rate at which magnetic gradients are built up by real photospheric flows.
Finally, we construct a hypothetical magnetic field with the inferred topology,
that can be used for future investigations of reconnection and energy release.

minimizes the sum of border lengths in all masks. In this paper, we propose two
parallel algorithms for the BLMP. The proposed parallel algorithms have the

peaks corresponding to three energy gaps are clearly observed. Two of these

Fe II lines in emission. An average of all the spectra (corrected for the

reconstructions show that the accretion disc is not contributing to the optical
line emission, which is instead dominated by the irradiated hemisphere of the
companion star facing the neutron star. We could not detect absorption features
from the mass donor star in the spectra. The emission lines appear broad, with
an intrinsic FWHM of 255+-22 km/s. Under the assumption that the width of the
Fe II emission lines is dominated by rotational broadening, we obtain a lower
limit on the compact object mass which is inconsistent with a NS accretor. We
discuss this incongruity and conclude that either the lines are blends of
unresolved features (although this requires some fine tuning) or they are
broadened by additional effects such as bulk gas motion in an outflow. The fact
that the Fe II lines slightly lag in phase with respect to the companion star
can be understood as outflowing gas consistent with a Black-Widow like
scenario. Nevertheless, we can not rule out the possibility that blends of
various emission lines cause the apparent phase lag of the Fe II emission lines

and Weismantel showed that if the so-called max-facet-width of all $L \in
\mathcal{L}$ is bounded from above by a constant independent of $L$, then
$\bigcap_{L\in \mathcal{L}} R_L(P)$ is a rational polyhedron. We give a short
proof of a generalization of this result. We also give a characterization for
the boundedness of the max-facet-width on $\mathcal{L}$. The presented results
are motivated by applications in cutting-plane theory from mixed-integer
optimization.

during warm inflation via a supersymmetric two-stage mechanism, where the
inflaton is coupled to heavy mediator fields that then decay into light species
through B- and CP-violating interactions. In contrast with thermal GUT
baryogenesis models, the temperature during inflation is always below the heavy
mass threshold, simultaneously suppressing thermal and quantum corrections to
the inflaton potential and the production of dangerous GUT relics. This
naturally gives a small baryon asymmetry close to the observed value, although
parametrically larger values may be diluted after inflation along with any
gravitino overabundance. Furthermore, this process yields baryon isocurvature
perturbations within the range of future experiments, making this an attractive
and testable model of GUT baryogenesis.

evolution of the scale factor $a(t)$ in the Einstein-de Sitter cosmology model
(EdS). We propose two modifications to the Regge calculus approach: 1) we allow
the graphical links on spatial hypersurfaces to be large, as in direct particle
interaction when the interacting particles reside in different galaxies, and 2)
we assume luminosity distance $D_L$ is related to graphical proper distance
$D_p$ by the equation $D_L = (1+z)\sqrt{\overrightarrow{D_p}\cdot
\overrightarrow{D_p}}$, where the inner product can differ from its usual
trivial form. The modified Regge calculus model (MORC), EdS and $\Lambda$CDM
are compared using the data from the Union2 Compilation, i.e., distance moduli
and redshifts for type Ia supernovae. We find that a best fit line through
$\displaystyle \log{(\frac{D_L}{Gpc})}$ versus $\log{z}$ gives a correlation of
0.9955 and a sum of squares error (SSE) of 1.95. By comparison, the best fit
$\Lambda$CDM gives SSE = 1.79 using $H_o$ = 69.2 km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_{M}$ = 0.29
and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.71. The best fit EdS gives SSE = 2.68 using $H_o$ =
60.9 km/s/Mpc. The best fit MORC gives SSE = 1.77 and $H_o$ = 73.9 km/s/Mpc
using $R = A^{-1}$ = 8.38 Gcy and $m = 1.71\times 10^{52}$ kg, where $R$ is the
current graphical proper distance between nodes, $A^{-1}$ is the scaling factor
from our non-trival inner product, and $m$ is the nodal mass. Thus, MORC
improves EdS as well as $\Lambda$CDM in accounting for distance moduli and
redshifts for type Ia supernovae without having to invoke accelerated
expansion, i.e., there is no dark energy and the universe is always
decelerating.

of the standard model particles are possibly observed as resonances in the

distinguish whether the resonances are due to low-scale string or some other
""new physics"". One is a characteristic angular distribution in dijet events at
the resonance due to spin degeneracy of string excited states, and the other is
an appearance of the second resonance at a characteristic mass of second string

low-scale string models by Monte Carlo simulations with a reference value of
M_s = 4 TeV at sqrt{s} = 14 TeV. It is shown that spin degeneracy at the dijet

velocimetry (PIV) with an image sampling rate of 4500 frames per second was
used to simultaneously measure the instantaneous velocity, material
acceleration and pressure distributions. The latter was calculated by
integrating the spatial distribution of in-plane components of the material
acceleration. A large database of instantaneous realizations visualized the
dynamic changes to the shear layer vortices, such as deformation and breakup as
they impinged and climbed over the cavity trailing corner. These interactions
cause time-dependent formation of a pressure maximum as the flow impinges on
the forward facing surface of the trailing corner, and a minimum above the
corner, where large local pressure gradients dominate the generation of fresh
vorticity. Data analysis shows that interactions with the corner involve two
time scales. Intermediate Strouhal numbers (0.6-3.2) are associated with
interaction of the shear layer vortices with the corner, while vertical
flapping of the shear layer occurs at low Strouhal numbers (0.1-0.6).

mass of a cluster without making assumptions about the way the mass is
distributed in the cluster. These methods are particularly powerful in the case
of galaxy clusters with a large number of constraints. The advantage of not
assuming implicitly that the luminous matter follows the dark matter is
particularly interesting in those cases where the cluster is in a non-relaxed
dynamical state. On the other hand, non-parametric methods have several
limitations that should be taken into account carefully. We explore some of
these limitations and focus on their implications for the possible ring of dark
matter around the galaxy cluster CL0024+17. We project three background
galaxies through a mock cluster of known radial profile density and obtain a
map for the arcs ($\theta$ map). We also calculate the shear field associated
with the mock cluster across the whole field of view (3.3 arcmin). Combining
the positions of the arcs and the two-direction shear, we perform an inversion
of the lens equation using two separate methods, the biconjugate gradient, and
the quadratic programming (QADP) to reconstruct the convergence map of the mock
cluster. We explore the space of the solutions of the convergence map and
compare the radial density profiles to the density profile of the mock cluster.
When the inversion matrix algorithms are forced to find the exact solution, we
encounter systematic effects resembling ring structures, that clearly depart
from the original convergence map. Overfitting lensing data with a
non-parametric method can produce ring-like structures similar to the alleged
one in CL0024.

Nernst effect (ANE) and the spin Seebeck effect (SSE), respectively. In the
local ANE experiments, we detect the voltage in the Co2FeAl thin film plane as
a function of the laser spot position and external magnetic field magnitude and
orientation. The local SSE effect is detected in a similar fashion by
exploiting the inverse spin Hall effect in a Pt layer deposited on top of the
Y3Fe5O12. Our findings establish local thermal spin and charge current
generation as well as spin caloritronic domain imaging.

concentrate on two aspects: inflationary trajectories and particle production.
Our findings can be summarized in two main results: first, that inflationary
trayectories that are very flat and provide enough number of e-foldings are
natural in the scenario without fine tunning. We present a general formalism to
identify attractors in multi-field inflation regardless of trajectories
fulfilling the slow-roll conditions. We then explore particle production in the
model and show how the inflaton naturally transmutes into a dark matter
particle. One interesting feature of our model is that it provides a novel
mechanism to generate particles and entropy in the universe: the filling of the
Fermi sphere up to a given momentum p_F due to the sea of goldstinos that are
an important part of the matter generated after inflation. With this mechanism
in hand we predict that the gravitino should have a mass of > 100-1000 TeV.
Another interesting feature of our model is that the predicted level of gravity
waves is r=0.1 - 0.001, which is in the range of detectability from Planck and
upcoming CMB polarization experiments.

integral length scale (\lambda) anisotropy associated with the turbulent
magnetic fluctuations, with respect to the aging of fluid parcels traveling
away from the Sun, and according to whether the measured \lambda is principally
parallel (\lambda_parallel) or perpendicular (\lambda_perp) to the direction of
a suitably defined local ensemble average magnetic field B0. We analyze a set
of 1065 24-hour long intervals (covering full missions). For each interval, we
compute the magnetic autocorrelation function, using classical
single-spacecraft techniques, and estimate \lambda with help of two different
proxies for both Helios datasets. We find that close to the Sun,
\lambda_parallel < \lambda_perp. This supports a slab-like spectral model,
where the population of fluctuations having wavevector k parallel to B0 is much
larger than the one with k-vector perpendicular. A population favoring
perpendicular k-vectors would be considered quasi-two dimensional (2D). Moving
towards 1 AU, we find a progressive isotropization of \lambda and a trend to
reach an inverted abundance, consistent with the well-known result at 1 AU that
\lambda_parallel > \lambda_perp, usually interpreted as a dominant quasi-2D
picture over the slab picture. Thus, our results are consistent with driving
modes having wavevectors parallel to B0 near Sun, and a progressive dynamical
spectral transfer of energy to modes with perpendicular wavevectors as the
solar wind parcels age while moving from the Sun to 1 AU.

spectra observed for each star are separated in time by less than four hours,

generation (HHG) in aligned N$_2$ molecules using a 1200-nm intense laser field
when the generating pulse is perpendicular to the aligning one. With increasing
laser intensity, the minimum in the HHG spectra first shifts its position and
then disappears. Theoretical simulations including the macroscopic propagation
effects in the medium reproduce these observations and the disappearance of the
minimum is attributed to the additional contribution of HHG from inner
orbitals. We also predict that the well-known shape resonance in the
photoionization spectra of N$_2$ should exist in the HHG spectra. It is most
clearly seen when the generating laser is parallel to the aligning one, and
disappears gradually as the angle between the two lasers increases. No clear
evidence of this shape resonance has been reported so far when using lasers
with different wavelengths. Further experimentation is needed to draw
conclusions.

the signature of Boolean algebras with a unary predicate representing,
respectively, the property of being connected, and the property of having a
connected interior. These languages are interpreted over the regular closed
sets of n-dimensional Euclidean space (n greater than 1) and, additionally,
over the regular closed polyhedral sets of n-dimensional Euclidean space. The
resulting logics are examples of formalisms that have recently been proposed in
the Artificial Intelligence literature under the rubric ""Qualitative Spatial
Reasoning."" We prove that the satisfiability problem for Bc is undecidable over
the regular closed polyhedra in all dimensions greater than 1, and that the
satisfiability problem for both languages is undecidable over both the regular
closed sets and the regular closed polyhedra in the Euclidean plane. However,
we also prove that the satisfiability problem for Bc0 is NP-complete over the
regular closed sets in all dimensions greater than 2, while the corresponding
problem for the regular closed polyhedra is ExpTime-complete. Our results show,
in particular, that spatial reasoning over Euclidean spaces is much harder than
reasoning over arbitrary topological spaces.

trajectories provides important details for the understanding of many chemical
reactions, protein folding, drug design, and solvation effects. MD simulations
using trajectories have achieved great successes in the computer simulations of
various systems, but it is difficult to incorporate quantum effects in a robust
way. Therefore, improving quantum wavepacket dynamics and incorporating
nonadiabatic transitions and quantum effects into classical and semi-classical
molecular dynamics is critical as well as challenging. In this paper, we
present a MD scheme in which a new set of equations of motion (EOM) are
proposed to effectively propagate nuclear trajectories while conserving quantum
mechanical energy which is critical for describing quantum effects like
tunneling. The new quantum EOM is tested on a one-state one-dimensional and a
two-state two-dimensional model nonadiabatic systems. The global quantum force
experienced by each trajectory promotes energy redistribution among the bundle
of trajectories, and thus helps the individual trajectory tunnel through the
potential barrier higher than the energy of the trajectory itself. Construction
of the new quantum force and EOM also provides a better way to treat the issue
of back-reaction in mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods, i.e.
self-consistency between quantum degrees of freedom (DOF) and classical DOF.

In this work we study how electron-electron interaction may lead to spontaneous

a critical interaction strength exists, above which the surface is unstable to
spontaneous formation of magnetization, and study the dependence of this
critical interaction strength on temperature and chemical potential.

  Information Fusion 2011",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been a lot of interest in developing algorithms to extract clusters
or communities from networks. This work proposes a method, based on
blockmodelling, for leveraging communities and other topological features for
use in a predictive classification task. Motivated by the issues faced by the
field of community detection and inspired by recent advances in Bayesian topic
modelling, the presented model automatically discovers topological features
relevant to a given classification task. In this way, rather than attempting to
identify some universal best set of clusters for an undefined goal, the aim is
to find the best set of clusters for a particular purpose.
  Using this method, topological features can be validated and assessed within
a given context by their predictive performance.
  The proposed model differs from other relational and semi-supervised learning
models as it identifies topological features to explain the classification
decision. In a demonstration on a number of real networks the predictive
capability of the topological features are shown to rival the performance of
content based relational learners. Additionally, the model is shown to
outperform graph-based semi-supervised methods on directed and approximately
bipartite networks.

coefficients that balance the equation. Indeed, the null space contains
everything there is to know about balancing any chemical-reaction equation!
