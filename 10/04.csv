recently reported, in arXiv:1109.4897v1, high-accuracy velocity measurements of
neutrinos from the CERN CNGS beam over the 730 km distance between the two

appeared to arrive at the OPERA detector about 60 ns (or equivalently 18 m)
earlier than would have been expected if they had traveled at the speed of
light, with high statistical significance. As the authors did not indicate
whether and how they took into account the Coriolis or Sagnac effect that
Earth's rotation has on the (southeastwards traveling) neutrinos, this brief

matter density field. Their clustering can be studied through the cosmic
infrared background anisotropies. These anisotropies have been measured from
100 \mum to 2 mm in the last few years. In this paper, we present a fully
parametric model allowing a joint analysis of these recent observations. In
order to develop a coherent model at various wavelengths, we rely on two
building blocks. The first one is a parametric model that describes the
redshift evolution of the luminosity function of star-forming galaxies. It
compares favorably to measured differential number counts and luminosity
functions. The second one is a halo model based description of the clustering
of galaxies. Starting from a fiducial model, we investigate parameter
degeneracies using a Fisher analysis. We then discuss how halo of different
mass and redshift, how LIRGs and ULIRGs, contribute to the CIB angular power
spectra.
  From the Fisher analysis, we conclude that we cannot constrain the parameters
of the model of evolution of galaxies using clustering data only. The use of
combined data of C\ell, counts and luminosity functions improves slightly the
constraints but does not remove any degeneracies. On the contrary, the
measurement of the anisotropies allows us to set interesting constraints on the
halo model parameters, even if some strong degeneracies remain. Using our
fiducial model, we establish that the 1-halo and 2-halo terms are not sensitive
to the same mass regime. We also illustrate how the 1-halo term can be
misinterpreted with the Poisson noise term. Conclusions. We present a new model
of the clustering of infrared galaxies. However such a model has a few
limitations, as the parameters of the halo occupation suffer from strong
degeneracies.

well described phenomena of breakdown. In the classical scenario, explosive
electron emission (EEE), breakdown (BD) originates from an emitting site
(surface protrusion). The conditioning process consists of ""burning"" the
emitting sites one after another and numerous observations exhibit surfaces
covered with molten craters that more or less overlap. When dealing with RF
cavities for accelerators, where increasingly fields are now sought, one can
legitimately wonder if other physical phenomena should also be taken into
account. In particular, we believe that electromigration, especially at
surfaces or grain boundaries cannot be neglected anymore at high field (i.e.
50-100 MV/m). Many publications in the domain of liquid metal emission sources
show that very stable and strong emission sources, either ions or electrons,
build up on metallic surfaces submitted to electrical fields through a
mechanism that is slightly different from the usual localized breakdown evoked
in accelerators. This mechanism involves the combination of electromigration
and collective motion of surface atoms. The recent results obtained on 30 GHz
CLIC (Compact Linear Collider) accelerating structures, altogether with the
data exposed hereafter have led us to propose a complementary scenario
(pre-plasma apparition), based on electromigration, which could explain early
melting of large areas of the surface.

We include the effects of vertical gradients in a horizontal background

pressure limit as an entry point for investigating the coupling between the
photon bubble instability and the Parker instability. Apart from factors that
depend on wavenumber orientation, the Parker instability exists for wavelengths
longer than a characteristic wavelength lambda_{tran}, while photon bubbles
exist for wavelengths shorter than lambda_{tran}. The growth rate in the Parker
regime is independent of the orientation of the horizontal component of the
wavenumber when radiative diffusion is rapid, but the range of Parker-like
wavenumbers is extended if there exists strong horizontal shear between field
lines (i.e. horizontal wavenumber perpendicular to the magnetic field). Finite
gas pressure introduces an additional short wavelength limit to the Parker-like
behavior, and also limits the growth rate of the photon bubble instability to a
constant value at short wavelengths. We also consider the effects of
differential rotation with accretion disk applications in mind. Our results may
explain why photon bubbles have not yet been observed in recent stratified
shearing box accretion disk simulations. Photon bubbles may physically exist in
simulations with high radiation to gas pressure ratios, but higher spatial
resolution will be needed to resolve the asymptotically growing unstable

a short-time asymptotic expansion of the claim's price process, we develop an

of the underlying Markov chain. The proposed approach is applied to price not
only simple European claims such as defaultable bonds, but also a new type of
path-dependent claims that we term self-decomposable, as well as the important
class of vulnerable call and put options on a stock. We provide a detailed
error analysis and illustrate the accuracy and computational complexity of our
method on several market traded instruments, such as defaultable bond prices,
barrier options, and vulnerable call options. Using again our Poisson series
representation, we show differentiability in time of the pre-default price
function of European vulnerable claims, which enables us to rigorously deduce
Feynman-Kac representations for the pre-default pricing function and new
semimartingale representations for the price process of the vulnerable claim

symmetric outflows and reevaluate the photospheric radius for each model during

and the shell models there are two asymptotic solutions for the optical depth
during the coasting phase of the outflow. In particular we show that quite
counterintuitively a geometrically thin shell may appear as a thick wind for
photons propagating inside it. For this reason we introduce notions of photon
thick and photon thin outflows, which appear more general and better physically
motivated with respect to winds and shells. Photosphere of relativistic outflow
is a dynamic surface. We study its geometry and find that the photosphere of
photon thin outflow has always a convex shape, while in the photon thick one it
is initially convex (there is always a photon thin layer in any outflow) and
then it becomes concave asymptotically approaching the photosphere of an
infinitely long wind. We find that both instantaneous and time integrated
observed spectra are very close to the thermal one for photon thick outflows,
in line with existing studies. It is our main finding that the photospheric
emission from the photon thin outflow produces non thermal time integrated
spectra, which may be described by the Band function well known in the GRB
literature. We find that energetic GRBs should produce photon thin outflows
with photospheric emission lasting less than one second for the total energy
$E_0\leq10^{54}$ erg and baryonic loading parameter $B\leq10^{-2}$. It means
that only time integrated spectra may be observed from such GRBs.

significance of 17 standard deviations over the lifetime of the experiment. The
experiment was sensitive to approximately 100 GeV - 100 TeV gamma ray air
showers by observing the particle footprint reaching the ground. The fraction
of detectors recording signals from photons at the ground is a suitable proxy
for the energy of the primary particle and has been used to measure the photon
energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula between ~1 and ~100 TeV. The TeV emission is
believed to be caused by inverse-Compton up-scattering scattering of ambient
photons by an energetic electron population. The location of a TeV steepening

been shown that gravitational waves have a nonlinear memory, displacing test

effect of gravitational waves, enlarging the permanent displacement of test
masses. In experiments like LISA or LIGO which measure distances of test
masses, the Christodoulou memory will manifest itself as a permanent
displacement of these objects. It has been suggested to detect the
Christodoulou memory effect using radio telescopes investigating small changes
in pulsar's pulse arrival times. The latter experiments are based on
present-day technology and measure changes in frequency. In the present paper,
we study the electromagnetic Christodoulou memory effect and compute it for
binary neutron star mergers. These are typical sources of gravitational
radiation. During these processes, not only mass and momenta are radiated away
in form of gravitational waves, but also very strong magnetic fields are
produced and radiated away. Moreover, a large portion of the energy is carried
away by neutrinos. We give constraints on the conditions, where the energy
transported by electromagnetic radiation is of similar or slightly higher order
than the energy radiated in gravitational waves or in form of neutrinos. We
find that for coalescing neutron stars, large magnetic fields magnify the
Christodoulou memory as long as the gaseous environment is sufficiently
rarefied. Thus the observed effect on test masses of a laser interferometer
gravitational wave detector will be enlarged by the contribution of the
electromagnetic field. Therefore, the present results are important for the

of an observable, which were introduced by Dressel et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104
240401 (2010)]. The theory of contextual values extends the well-established
theory of generalized state measurements by bridging the gap between partial
state collapse and the observables that represent physically relevant
information about the system. To emphasize the general utility of the concept,
we first construct the full theory of contextual values within an operational
formulation of classical probability theory, paying special attention to
observable construction, detector coupling, generalized measurement, and
measurement disturbance. We then extend the results to quantum probability
theory built as a superstructure on the classical theory, pointing out both the
classical correspondences to and the full quantum generalizations of both
L\""uder's rule and the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz rule in the process. We find
in both cases that the contextual values of a system observable form a
generalized spectrum that is associated with the independent outcomes of a
partially correlated and generally ambiguous detector; the eigenvalues are a
special case when the detector is perfectly correlated and unambiguous. To
illustrate the approach, we apply the technique to both a classical example of
marble color detection and a quantum example of polarization detection. For the
quantum example we detail two devices: Fresnel reflection from a glass
coverslip, and continuous beam displacement from a calcite crystal. We also
analyze the three-box paradox to demonstrate that no negative probabilities are
necessary in its analysis. Finally, we provide a derivation of the quantum weak
value as a limit point of a pre- and postselected conditioned average and
provide sufficient conditions for the derivation to hold.

experiment, which indicates that neutrinos travel faster than the speed of

must not destroy the complicated (nonlinear) structure of the proton waveform
recovered in the neutrino signal. As one example, consider that only a fraction
of the neutrinos travel faster than the speed of light, such as sterile
neutrinos. We fit the OPERA data including this fraction as a free variable,
assuming that the OPERA result is correct. In our analysis, the best-fit values
are 50% of the neutrinos being superluminal and (v-c)/c = 4.5 10^{-5}, where
the neutrino velocity increases as the fraction of superluminal neutrinos
decreases. The minimal fraction of superluminal neutrinos is found to be 17% (3
sigma), which is constrained by the non-linearity of the proton waveform. This
minimal fraction challenges the hypothesis that only sterile neutrinos travel
faster than the speed of light. In addition, we demonstrate that an
experimental effect introducing a smearing between the proton waveform and
neutrino signal, as expected for some systematical errors, is also limited by
the shape of the waveform. Finally, we illustrate that even stronger
constraints may be obtained from the recent analysis with a short-bunch beam,
in spite of the low statistics.

nevertheless does not correspond to the KPZ universality class. This novel
asymptotic behavior is characterized by two scaling laws that fix the critical
exponents to dimension-independent values, that agree with previous reports
from numerical simulations and experimental systems. We show that the precise
form of the linear stabilizing terms does not modify the hydrodynamic behavior
of these equations. One of the scaling laws, usually associated with Galilean
invariance, is shown to derive from a vertex cancellation that occurs (at least
to one loop order) for any choice of linear terms in the equation of motion and
is independent on the morphological stability of the surface, hence
generalizing this well-known property of the KPZ equation. Moreover, the
argument carries over to other systems like the Lai-Das Sarma-Villain equation,

results in a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic symmetry reduction and is associated

very small spin space anisotropy, the magnetic transition separates from the
orbital one in temperature, and the orbital transition is found to be in the
Ising universality class. With increasing anisotropy, the two transitions
rapidly merge together and tend to become weakly first order. We also study the

between 1983 and 2009 clearly show a steady and significant drop in the
turbulence levels in the entire inner heliosphere starting from around ~1995.
We believe that this large-scale IPS signature, in the inner heliosphere,
coupled with the fact that solar polar fields have also been declining since
~1995, provide a consistent result showing that the buildup to the deepest
minimum in 100 years actually began more than a decade earlier.

integrating out the high-energy scale in the Hubbard model. At low energies,
the number of excitations that couple minimally to the electromagnetic gauge is
less than the conserved charge, thereby implying a breakdown of Fermi liquid
theory. In addition, two charge $e$ excitations emerge in the lower band, the
standard projected electron and a composite entity (comprised of a hole and a
charge $2e$ bosonic field) which give rise to poles and zeros of the
single-particle Green function, respectively. The poles generate spectral
weight along an arc centered at $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ while the zeros kill the
spectral intensity on the back-side of the arc. The result is the Fermi arc
structure intrinsic to cuprate phenomenology. The presence of composite
excitations also produces a broad incoherent pseudogap feature at the $(\pi,0)$
region of the Brillouin zone, thereby providing a mechanism for the
nodal/anti-nodal dichotomy seen in the cuprates.

interactions antiferromagnetic long range ordering at T_N\simeq10K takes place.
Application of external magnetic field B along the magnetically easy axis

monopole, about $10^3$ cm in OPERA. No matter how far they travel, neutrinos
always arrive earlier than photons by the same amount of time, provided a
monopole existing on or close to their trajectories. This conclusion can be
tested by future experiments. The result reconciles the contradiction between
OPERA and supernova neutrinos. We further exclude cosmic strings as a possible
theoretical explanation.

particular, the additional contributions to the particle velosity \delta
v\equiv (v-c)/c from string theory is proportional to both the particle energy
and the D3-brane number density, and is inversely proportional to the string
scale. Thus, we can realize the background dependent Lorentz violation
naturally by varying the D3-brane number density in space time. To explain the
superluminal neutrino propagations in the OPERA and MINOS experiments, the
string scale should be around 10^5 GeV. With very tiny D3-brane number density
on the interstellar scale, we can also explain the time delays for the high

Integrating the flux density from the observed 1.4 GHz radio source count
produces a brightness temperature of ~100 mK---less than a quarter of the
observed CRB at 1.4 GHz. Radio quiet AGN are a large fraction of the 1.4 GHz
uJy sources and typically host significant star formation. Thus, it is possible
that AGN and host star formation could be responsible for some fraction of the
excess CRB at 1.4 GHz. Here, an X-ray background population synthesis model is
used in conjunction with empirical radio to X-ray luminosity ratios to
calculate the AGN contribution to the CRB at 1.4 GHz including the emission
from host star formation. It is found that AGN and host star formation
contribute <~9% of the CRB at 1.4 GHz. When all known 1.4 GHz radio source
classes are considered, <~60% of the CRB at 1.4 GHz is accounted for;
therefore, it is necessary that either known radio sources evolve significantly
at flux densities below current survey sensitivity limits or a new population
of low flux density radio sources exist.

composite fermion state. We obtain the number of independent angular momentum
multiplets of quasiparticle and exciton trial states for systems of up to 20
electrons. We find that the counting for quasielectrons at large angular
momentum on the sphere matches that expected from the CFT which describes the
Moore-Read state's boundary theory. In particular, the counting for
quasielectrons is the same as for quasiholes, in accordance with the idea that
the CFT describing both sides of the FQH plateau should be the same. We also
show that our trial wave functions have good overlaps with exact wave functions
obtained using various interactions, including second Landau level Coulomb
interactions and the 3-body delta interaction for which the Pfaffian states and
their quasiholes are exact ground states. We discuss how these results relate

excitations over the Pfaffian state as well as to earlier work by Hansson et
al., which has produced trial wave functions for quasiparticles based on
conformal field theory methods and by Bernevig and Haldane, which produced
trial wave functions based on clustering properties and `squeezing'.

possible if there exists a new (dark) neutrino which can propagate with a
superluminal velocity and which couples with usual neutrinos only via the mass
mixing leading to neutrino oscillations. It is supposed that the physical laws
are invariant under rotations and translations in a preferred reference frame.
Two possible pictures to parameterize departures from Lorentz invariance are
discussed: a ""conventional"" tachyonic dark neutrino and the modification of the
Lagrangian by adding perturbations with the maximum attainable speed of the
dark neutrino which is larger than the speed of light in vacuum. We analyze
also the MINOS and SN1987a data and show that they are consistent with the

We find that the present day orbital energy is tightly correlated with the time
at which subhalos last crossed into the virial radius. This energy-infall
correlation provides a means to infer infall times for Milky Way satellite
galaxies. Assuming that the Milky Way's assembly can be modeled by VL2, we show
that the infall times of some satellites are well constrained given only their
Galactocentric positions and line-of-sight velocities. The constraints sharpen
for satellites with proper motion measurements. We find that Carina, Ursa
Minor, and Sculptor were all accreted early, more than 8 Gyr ago. Five other
dwarfs, including Sextans and Segue 1, are also probable early accreters,
though with larger uncertainties. On the other extreme, Leo T is just falling
into the Milky Way for the first time while Leo I fell in \sim 2 Gyr ago and is
now climbing out of the Milky Way's potential after its first perigalacticon.
The energies of several other dwarfs, including Fornax and Hercules, point to
intermediate infall times, 2 - 8 Gyr ago. We compare our infall time estimates
to published star formation histories and find hints of a dichotomy between
ultrafaint and classical dwarfs. The classical dwarfs appear to have quenched
star formation after infall but the ultrafaint dwarfs tend to be quenched long
before infall, at least for the cases in which our uncertainties allow us to
discern differences. Our analysis suggests that the Large Magellanic Cloud
crossed inside the Milky Way virial radius recently, within the last \sim 4

isolated, bright elliptical galaxy, surrounded by a group of smaller galaxies
lacking L* objects. We analyzed the near-infrared photometric and structural
properties of a sample of 20 BGGs present in FGs in order to better understand
their formation mechanisms. Their surface-brightness distribution was fitted to
a Sersic profile using the GASP2D algorithm. Then, the standard scaling
relations were derived for the first time for these galaxies and compared with
those of normal ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies in non-fossil
systems. The BGGs presented in this study represent a subset of the most
massive galaxies in the Universe. We found that their ellipticity profiles are
continuously increasing with the galactocentric radius. Our fossil BCGs follow
closely the fundamental plane described by normal ellipticals. However, they
depart from both the log \sigma_0 vs. log L_{K_{s}} and log r_{\rm e} vs. log
L_{K_{s}} relations described by intermediate mass ellipticals. This occurs in
the sense that our BGGs have larger effective radii and smaller velocity
dispersions than those predicted by these relations. We also found that more
elliptical galaxies systematically deviate from the previous relations while
more rounder object do not. No similar correlation was found with the Sersic
index. The derived scaling relations can be interpreted in terms of the
formation scenario of the BGGs. Because our BGGs follow the fundamental plane
tilt but they have larger effective radii than expected for intermediate mass
ellipticals, we suggest that they only went through dissipational mergers in a
early stage of their evolution and then assembled the bulk of their mass
through subsequent dry mergers, contrary to previous claims that BGGs in FGs
were formed mainly by the merging of gas-rich galaxies.

surrounded by several M_h\sim10^11Msun halos which could host the fainter

ground and space based telescopes are required to secure the z\sim8 nature of
the overdensity, discover new members, and measure their precise redshift.

can be driven by a Raman Eg mode, we performed Raman scattering measurements on
CuFeO2 between 5 K and 290 K. Considering that the isostructural multiferroic
compound CuCrO2 might show similar structural deformations at the
antiferromagnetic transition TN1 = 24.3 K, Raman measurements have also been
performed for comparison. At ambient temperature, the Raman modes in CuFeO2 are

analysis of the temperature dependence of modes shows that the frequency of all

anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions. These results clearly indicate that none
of the Raman active modes observed in CuFeO2 and CuCrO2 drive the pseudoproper

baryonic matter in the early Universe causes the electron temperature to be
slightly lower than the radiation temperature. Thermalization of photons with a
colder plasma results in the accumulation of photons in the Rayleigh-Jeans
tail, aided by stimulated recoil, while the higher frequency spectrum tries to
approach Planck spectrum at the electron temperature
$T_{\gamma}^{final}=\Te<T_{\gamma}^{initial}$; i.e., Bose-Einstein condensation
of photons occurs. We find new solutions of the Kompaneets equation describing
this effect. No actual condensate is, in reality, possible since the process is
very slow and photons drifting to low frequencies are efficiently absorbed by
bremsstrahlung and double Compton processes. The spectral distortions created
by Bose-Einstein condensation of photons are within an order of magnitude (for
the present range of allowed cosmological parameters), with exactly the same
spectrum but opposite in sign, of those created by diffusion damping of the
acoustic waves on small scales corresponding to comoving wavenumbers $45< k<
10^4\, Mpc^{-1}$. The initial perturbations on these scales are completely
unobservable today due to their being erased completely by Silk damping. There
is partial cancellation of these two distortions, leading to suppression of
$\mu$ distortions expected in the standard model of cosmology. The net
distortion depends on the scalar power index $n_S$ and its running $d n_S/d\ln
k$, and may vanish for special values of parameters, for example, for a running
spectrum with, $n_S=1,d n_S/d\ln k=-0.038$. We arrive at an intriguing
conclusion: even a null result, non-detection of $\mu$-type distortion at a
sensitivity of $10^{-9}$, gives a quantitative measure of the primordial
small-scale power spectrum.

the only known globular cluster with possible evidence for dark matter, based
on a Keck/HIRES 21 star velocity dispersion of sigma=2.2+/-0.4 km/s. We
reproduce this measurement, but demonstrate that it is inflated by unresolved
binary stars. For our sample of 61 stars, the velocity dispersion is
sigma=0.7(+0.6/-0.5) km/s. Combining our DEIMOS data with literature values,
our final velocity dispersion is sigma=0.4(+0.4/-0.3) km/s. We determine a
spectroscopic metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.6+/-0.1 dex, placing a 1-sigma upper
limit of sigma_[Fe/H]~0.2 dex on any internal metallicity spread. We determine
Palomar 13's total luminosity to be M_V=-2.8+/-0.4, making it among the least
luminous known globular clusters. The photometric isophotes are regular out to
the half-light radius and mildly irregular outside this radius. The outer
surface brightness profile slope is shallower than typical globular clusters
(eta=-2.8+/-0.3). Thus at large radius, tidal debris is likely affecting the
appearance of Palomar 13. Combining our luminosity with the intrinsic velocity
dispersion, we find a dynamical mass of of M_1/2=1.3(+2.7/-1.3)x10^3 M_sun and
a mass-to-light ratio of M/L_V=2.4(+5.0/-2.4) M_sun/L_sun. Within our
measurement errors, the mass-to-light ratio agrees with the theoretical
predictions for a single stellar population. We conclude that, while there is
some evidence for tidal stripping at large radius, the dynamical mass of
Palomar 13 is consistent with its stellar mass and neither significant dark
matter, nor extreme tidal heating, is required to explain the cluster dynamics.

interacting galaxies separated by < 15 h^{-1} kpc in projected distance and
|dv| <~ 60 km/s in line-of-sight velocity. The optical afterglows revealed in
early-epoch Hubble Space Telescope images are at least 2.5 h^{-1} kpc (or 0.4"")
away from the high surface brightness regions of the interacting members,
indicating that the GRB events occurred either in the outskirts of a compact
star-forming galaxy or in a low surface brightness satellite. Comparisons of
the systemic redshifts of the host galaxies and the velocity distribution of
absorbing clouds revealed in early-time afterglow spectra further show that the
majority of the absorbing clouds are redshifted from these compact star-forming
galaxies. These include the gas producing fine-structure absorption lines at
physical distances d ~ a few x 100 pc from the GRB afterglow. The lack of
blueshifted absorbing clouds and the spatial offset of the GRB event from the
star-forming regions make it difficult to attribute the observed large velocity
spread (~ 200-400 km/s) of absorbing gas in the GRB host to galactic-scale
outflows. We consider a scenario in which the GRB event occurred in a dwarf
satellite of the interacting group and interpret the broad absorption
signatures in the afterglow spectra as a collective effect of the turbulent
halo gas and the host star-forming ISM. We briefly discuss the implications for
the absorption properties observed in the afterglow spectra.

For given widths and separation of the intervals, the mutual information

causality argument qualitatively explains this behavior. The tripartite

13 with ""clear"" cavities and 7 with ""potential"" cavities (detection rate ~25

cooling time below 3 - 5 Gyrs, consistent with the idea that cavities sit
predominantly in cool core clusters. We also find no evidence for evolution in
any of the cavity properties with redshift, up to z~0.6. The cavities of
powerful outbursts are not larger (or smaller) at higher redshift, and are not
able to rise to further (or lesser) distances from the nucleus. The energetics
of these outbursts also remain the same. This suggests that extreme ""radio

Gyrs after the Big Bang and shows no sign of evolution since then. In other
words, AGNs lying at the centre of clusters are able to operate at early times

calculation of the system's reduced density matrix averaged over the quantum
core degrees of freedom which is then coupled to a classically evolved
reservoir to treat the remaining modes. We demonstrate our approach by applying
it to the spin-boson problem using the noninteracting blip approximation to
treat the system and core, and Ehrenfest dynamics to treat the reservoir. The
resulting hybrid methodology is accurate for both fast and slow baths, since it
naturally reduces to its composite methods in their respective regimes of
validity. In addition, our combined method is shown to yield good results in
intermediate regimes where neither approximation alone is accurate and to
perform equally well for both strong and weak system-bath coupling. Our
approach therefore provides an accurate and efficient methodology for
calculating quantum dynamics in complex systems.

the consequent feedback processes take place earlier in high-fnl models and
later in low-fnl ones. Mechanical feedback is responsible for shocking and
evacuating the gas from star forming sites earlier in the highly non-Gaussian
cases, because of the larger bias at high densities. Chemical feedback
translates into high-redshift metal filling factors that are larger by some
orders of magnitude for larger fnl, but that converge within one Gyr, for both
population III and population II-I stellar regimes. The efficient enrichment
process, though, leads to metallicities > 0.01 Zsun by redshift ~9, almost
independently from fnl. The impact of non-Gaussianities on the formation of
dark-matter haloes at high redshift is directly reflected in the properties of
the gas in these haloes, as models with larger fnl show more concentrated gas
profiles at early times. Non-Gaussian signatures in the gas behaviour are lost
after the first feedback takes place and introduces a significant degree of

has a rich mathematical structure underlying it. Despite the discreteness of
the space-time the theory exhibits an unexpected non-perturbative analog of
conformal symmetry that acts on the boundary of the geometry. The symmetry is
rooted in the mathematical properties of trees, p-adic numbers, and ultrametric
spaces; and in the physical property of detailed balance. We provide
self-contained elementary explanations of the unfamiliar mathematical concepts,
which have have also appeared in the study of the p-adic string.
  The symmetry acts on a huge collection of very low dimensional ""multiverse
fields"" that are not associated with the usual perturbative degrees of freedom.
They are connected with the late-time statistical distribution of
bubble-universes in the multiverse.
  The conformal symmetry which acts on the multiverse fields is broken by the
existence of terminal decays - to hats or crunches - but in a particularly
simple way. We interpret this symmetry breaking as giving rise to an arrow of
time.
  The model is used to calculate statistical correlations at late time and to
discuss the measure problem. We show that the natural cutoff in the model is
the analog of the so-called light-cone-time cutoff. Applying the model to the

environment. Closer examination can, however, reveal the subtle, cumulative
effects of multiple galaxy interactions. Hickson Compact Group (HCG) 59 is an
excellent example of this situation. We present a photometric study of this
group in the optical (HST), infrared (Spitzer) and X-ray (Chandra) regimes
aimed at characterizing the star formation and nuclear activity in its
constituent galaxies and intra-group medium. We associate five dwarf galaxies
with the group and update the velocity dispersion, leading to an increase in
the dynamical mass of the group of up to a factor of 10 (to 2.8e13 Msun), and a
subsequent revision of its evolutionary stage. Star formation is proceeding at
a level consistent with the morphological types of the four main galaxies, of
which two are star-forming and the other two quiescent. Unlike in some other
compact groups, star-forming complexes across HCG 59 closely follow mass-radius
scaling relations typical of nearby galaxies. In contrast, the ancient globular
cluster populations in galaxies HCG 59A and B show intriguing irregularities,
and two extragalactic HII regions are found just west of B. We age-date a faint
stellar stream in the intra-group medium at ~1 Gyr to examine recent
interactions. We detect a likely low-luminosity AGN in HCG 59A by its ~10e40
erg/s X-ray emission; the active nucleus rather than star formation can account
for the UV+IR SED. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context
of galaxy evolution in dense environments.

cannot be reconciled with current observations where milli-second pulsars are
generally seen to orbit white dwarfs in almost exactly circular orbits. Current
theoretical models of binary and stellar formation and evolution cannot explain
the high eccentricity of this system either. In this work, we present three new
epochs of optical spectroscopy for the companion to PSR J1903+0327, obtained to
confirm the association of the main-sequence star with the pulsar. These 3 new
epochs together with the 2 previous ones obtained by Freire et al. (2011)
firmly establish the high eccentricity of the companion's orbit as predicted by
pulsar timing. Using all five epochs of optical data, we have provided an
independent estimate of the mass-ratio, R=1.56\pm0.15 as well as the systemic
radial velocity of the binary, \gamma= 42.1\pm2.5 km/s. We constrain the
spectral type of the pulsar companion to lie between F5 V -- G0 V (a slightly
earlier type than suggested previously) by measuring the equivalent widths of
two of the three Ca-triplet lines (8498 \AA, 8542 \AA) and the Paschen line at
8598 \AA (P14); we also broadly constrain the metallicity of the companion.
Additionally, we have placed a somewhat better limit on the rotational velocity
of the pulsar companion of v_{rot}\sin{i} \leq 66 km/s which is still not
sufficient to allow a test of general relativity using this system.

representing, transmitting, publishing and archiving information about a
transient celestial event, with the implication that timely follow-up is of
interest. The objective is to motivate the observation of
targets-of-opportunity, to drive robotic telescopes, to trigger archive

photon events, but events mediated by disparate phenomena such as neutrinos,
gravitational waves, and solar or atmospheric particle bursts may also be
reported.
  Structured data is used, rather than natural language, so that automated
systems can effectively interpret VOEvent packets. Each packet may contain zero
or more of the ""who, what, where, when & how"" of a detected event, but in
addition, may contain a hypothesis (a ""why"") regarding the nature of the
underlying physical cause of the event. Citations to previous VOEvents may be
used to place each event in its correct context. Proper curation is encouraged
throughout each event's life cycle from discovery through successive
follow-ups. VOEvent packets gain persistent identifiers and are typically
stored in databases reached via registries. VOEvent packets may therefore
reference other packets in various ways. Packets are encouraged to be small and
to be processed quickly. This standard does not define a transport layer or the
design of clients, repositories, publishers or brokers; it does not cover
policy issues such as who can publish, who can build a registry of events, who
can subscribe to a particular registry, nor the intellectual property issues.

compression athermal systems with purely repulsive interactions undergo a
jamming transition at packing fraction $\phi_J$ from an unjammed state with
zero pressure to a jammed, rigid state with nonzero pressure. Using extensive
computer simulations, we show that a novel second-order-like transition, the
contact percolation transition, which signals the formation of a
system-spanning cluster of mutually contacting particles, occurs at $\phi_P <
\phi_J$, preceding the jamming transition. By measuring the number of
non-floppy modes of the dynamical matrix, and the displacement field and
time-dependent pressure following compression, we find that the contact
percolation transition also heralds the onset of complex spatiotemporal
response to applied stress. Thus, highly heterogeneous, cooperative, and
non-affine particle motion occurs in unjammed systems significantly below the
jamming transition for $\phi_P < \phi < \phi_J$, not only for jammed systems

likely gravitational-wave signals to be observed in ground based
interferometric detectors. Apart from the astrophysical importance of their
detection, they will also provide us with our very first empirical access to
the genuinely strong-field dynamics of General Relativity (GR). We present a
new framework based on Bayesian model selection aimed at detecting deviations
from GR, subject to the constraints of the Advanced Virgo and LIGO detectors.
The method tests the consistency of coefficients appearing in the waveform with
the predictions made by GR, without relying on any specific alternative theory
of gravity. The framework is suitable for low signal-to-noise ratio events
through the construction of multiple subtests, most of which involve only a
limited number of coefficients. It also naturally allows for the combination of
information from multiple sources to increase one's confidence in GR or a
violation thereof. We expect it to be capable of finding a wide range of
possible deviations from GR, including ones which in principle cannot be
accommodated by the model waveforms, on condition that the induced change in
phase at frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive is comparable
to the effect of a few percent change in one or more of the low-order
post-Newtonian phase coefficients. In principle the framework can be used with
any GR waveform approximant, with arbitrary parameterized deformations, to
serve as model waveforms. In order to illustrate the workings of the method, we
perform a range of numerical experiments in which simulated gravitational waves
modeled in the restricted post-Newtonian, stationary phase approximation are
added to Gaussian and stationary noise that follows the expected Advanced
LIGO/Virgo noise curves.

having infrared excess suggestive of circumstellar disks rotate more slowly
than their non-excess counterparts. A similar correlation is present among
F2-K9 type stars, but only at the ~97% confidence level. Among the early-type

~5 proper Mpc of seven luminous quasars at z~6. The constraints are obtained
from the Doppler widths of Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasar
near-zones and build upon our previous measurement for the z=6.02 quasar SDSS
J0818+1722. The expanded data set, combined with an improved treatment of
systematic uncertainties, yields an average temperature at the mean density of
log (T_0/K) = 4.21 \pm 0.03 (\pm^0.06_0.07) at 68 (95) per cent confidence for
a flat prior distribution over 3.2 < log (T_0/K) < 4.8. In comparison,
temperatures measured from the general IGM at z~5 are ~0.3 dex cooler, implying
an additional source of heating around these quasars which is not yet present
in the general IGM at slightly lower redshift. This heating is most likely due
to the recent reionisation of He-II in vicinity of these quasars, which have
hard, non-thermal ionising spectra. The elevated temperatures may therefore
represent evidence for the earliest stages of He-II reionisation in the most
biased regions of the high-redshift Universe. The temperature as a function of
distance from the quasars is consistent with being constant, log(T_0/K)~4.2,
with no evidence for a line-of-sight thermal proximity effect. However, the
limited extent of the quasar near-zones prevents the detection of He-III
regions larger than ~5 proper Mpc. Under the assumption the quasars have
reionised the He-II in their vicinity, we infer the data are consistent with an
average optically bright phase of duration in excess of 10^6.5 yr. These
measurements represent the highest-redshift IGM temperature constraints to
date, and thus provide a valuable data set for confronting models of H-I
reionisation.

important in Independent Components Analysis, also known as Blind Source
Separation, as well as polynomial optimization. We analyze the symmetric
rank-one approximation problem for symmetric tensors and derive several
perturbation results. Given a symmetric rank-one tensor obscured by noise, we
provide bounds on the accuracy of the best symmetric rank-one approximation for
recovering the original rank-one structure, and we show that any eigenvector
with sufficiently large eigenvalue is related to the rank-one structure as
well. Further, we show that for high-dimensional symmetric
approximately-rank-one tensors, the generalized Rayleigh quotient is mostly
close to zero, so the best symmetric rank-one approximation corresponds to a
prominent global extreme value. We show that each iteration of the Shifted
Symmetric Higher Order Power Method (SS-HOPM), when applied to a rank-one
symmetric tensor, moves towards the principal eigenvector for any input and
shift parameter, under mild conditions. Finally, we explore the best choice of
shift parameter for SS-HOPM to recover the principal eigenvector. We show that
SS-HOPM is guaranteed to converge to an eigenvector of an approximately
rank-one even-mode tensor for a wider choice of shift parameter than it is for
a general symmetric tensor. We also show that the principal eigenvector is a
stable fixed point of the SS-HOPM iteration for a wide range of shift
parameters; together with a numerical experiment, these results lead to a
non-obvious recommendation for shift parameter for the symmetric rank-one
approximation problem.

problem of high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates is about how an
antiferromagnetically ordered state can be turned into a short-range state by
doping. I will start with half-filling where the antiferromagnetic ground state
is accurately described by the Liang-Doucot-Anderson (LDA) wavefunction. Here
the effect of the Fermi statistics becomes completely irrelevant due to the no
double occupancy constraint. Upon doping, the statistical signs reemerge,
albeit much reduced as compared to the original Fermi statistical signs. By
precisely incorporating this altered statistical sign structure at finite
doping, the LDA ground state can be recast into a short-range antiferromagnetic
state. Superconducting phase coherence arises after the spin correlations
become short-ranged, and the superconducting phase transition is controlled by
spin excitations. I will stress that the pseudogap phenomenon naturally emerges
as a crossover between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases. As a
characteristic of non Fermi liquid, the mutual statistical interaction between
the spin and charge degrees of freedom will reach a maximum in a
high-temperature ""strange metal phase"" of the doped Mott insulator.

consistent with those of similar metallicity field stars in different

TY Gru remains the only n-capture enriched star among the RRab in our sample. A
new relation is found between microturbulence and effective temperature among

function of phase is empirically shown to be similar to the theoretical
variation. Finally, we conclude that the derived teffand log g values of our

Satisfiability (SAT) problem, using noise-based logic (NBL). Contrary to what
the name may suggest, NBL is not a random/fuzzy logic system. In fact, it is a
completely deterministic logic system. A key property of NBL is that it allows
us to apply a superposition of many input vectors to a SAT instance at the same
time, circumventing a key restriction and assumption in the traditional
approach to solving SAT. By exploiting the superposition property of NBL, our
NBL-based SAT algorithm can determine whether an instance is SAT or not in a
single operation. A satisfying solution can be found by iteratively performing
SAT check operations up to n times, where n is the number of variables in the
SAT instance. Although this paper does not focus on the realization of an
NBL-based SAT engine, such an engine can be conceived using analog circuits
(wide-band amplifiers, adders and multipliers), FPGAs or ASICs. Additionally,
we also discus scalability of our approach, which can apply to NBL in general.
The NBL-based SAT engine described in this paper has been simulated in software

are gained because the number density of string segments becomes larger. An
observationally important feature of the string-induced CMB polarizations is
that the string-lensed spectra decay more slowly on small scales compared with

synchrotron gamma-ray flares at photon energies above 100 MeV in the Crab
Nebula. This discovery suggests that electron-positron pairs in the nebula are
accelerated to PeV energies in a milliGauss magnetic field, which is difficult
to explain with classical models of particle acceleration and pulsar wind
nebulae. We investigate whether particle acceleration in a magnetic
reconnection layer can account for the puzzling properties of the flares. We
numerically integrate relativistic test-particle orbits in the vicinity of the
layer, including the radiation reaction force, and using analytical expressions
for the large-scale electromagnetic fields. As they get accelerated by the
reconnection electric field, the particles are focused deep inside the current
layer where the magnetic field is small. The electrons suffer less from
synchrotron losses and are accelerated to extremely high energies. Population
studies show that, at the end of the layer, the particle distribution piles up
at the maximum energy given by the electric potential drop and is focused into
a thin fan beam. Applying this model to the Crab Nebula, we find that the
emerging synchrotron emission spectrum peaks above 100 MeV and is close to the
spectral shape of a single electron. The flare inverse Compton emission is
negligible and no detectable emission is expected at other wavelengths. This
mechanism provides a plausible explanation for the gamma-ray flares in the Crab
Nebula and could be at work in other astrophysical objects such as relativistic
jets in active galactic nuclei.

serves as a tight lower bound for the symmetric information rate (SIR) as well
as capacity of the ISI channel corrupted by Gaussian noise. When evaluated on a
number of well-known finite-ISI channels, these new bounds provide a very
similar level of tightness against the SIR to the conjectured lower bound by
Shamai and Laroia at all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges, while being
actually tighter when viewed closed up at high SNRs. The new lower bounds are
obtained in two steps: First, a ""mismatched"" mutual information function is
introduced which can be proved as a lower bound to I(X; X+S+N). Secondly, this
function is further bounded from below by an expression that can be computed
easily via a few single-dimensional integrations with a small computational
load.

Accepted by Journal of Fluid Mechanics",,"10.1017/jfm.2012.143",,"astro-ph.GA physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The first generation of stars had very different properties than later
stellar generations, as they formed from a ""pristine"" gas that was free of
heavy elements. Normal star formation took place only after the first stars
polluted the surrounding turbulent interstellar gas, increasing its local heavy
element concentration, Z, beyond a critical value, Z_c (10^-8 < Z_c <10^-5).
Motivated by this astrophysical problem, we investigate the fundamental physics
of the pollution of pristine fluid elements in isotropic compressible
turbulence. Turbulence stretches the pollutants, produces concentration
structures at small scales, and brings the pollutants and the unpolluted flow
in closer contact. Our theoretical approach employs the probability
distribution function (PDF) method for turbulent mixing. We adopt three PDF
closure models and derive evolution equations for the pristine fraction from
the models. To test and constrain the theoretical models, we conduct numerical
simulations for decaying passive scalars in isothermal turbulent flows with
Mach numbers of 0.9 and 6.2, and compute the mass fraction, P(Z_c, t), of the
flow with Z < Z_c. In the Mach 0.9 flow, the evolution of P(Z_c, t)$ is well
described by a continuous convolution model and dP(Z_c, t)/dt = P(Z_c, t)
ln[P(Z_c, t)]/tau_con, if the mass fraction of the polluted flow is larger than
~ 0.1. If the initial pollutant fraction is smaller than ~ 0.1, an early phase
exists during which the pristine fraction follows an equation from a nonlinear
integral model: dP(Z_c, t)/dt = P(Z_c, t) [P(Z_c, t)-1]/tau_int. The timescales
tau_con and tau_int are measured from our simulations. When normalized to the
flow dynamical time, the decay of P(Z_ c, t) in the Mach 6.2 flow is slower
than at Mach 0.9, and we show that P(Z_c, t) in the Mach 6.2 flow can be well
fit using a formula from a generalized version of the self-convolution model.

sunspots show isothermal increases in umbral magnetic field strength which
cannot be explained by the simplified sunspot model with a single-component
ideal gas atmosphere assumed in previous investigations. Large sunspots
universally display non-linear increases in magnetic pressure over temperature,
while small sunspots and pores display linear behavior. The formation of

magnetic field, and we propose that this may explain the observed rapid
increase in umbral magnetic field strength relative to temperature. Existing
multi-component sunspot atmospheric models predict that a significant amount of
molecular hydrogen (H2) exists in the sunspot umbra. The formation of H2 can
significantly alter the thermodynamic properties of the sunspot atmosphere and
may play a significant role in sunspot evolution. In addition to the survey
observations, we have performed detailed chemical equilibrium calculations with
full consideration of radiative transfer effects to establish OH as a proxy for
H2, and demonstrate that a significant population of H2 exists in the coolest

increase data discriminability. In some situations, however, one may wish to
purposely decrease discriminability of one classification task (a ""distractor""
task), while simultaneously preserving information relevant to another (the
task-of-interest): For example, it may be important to mask the identity of
persons contained in face images before submitting them to a crowdsourcing site
(e.g., Mechanical Turk) when labeling them for certain facial attributes.
Another example is inter-dataset generalization: when training on a dataset
with a particular covariance structure among multiple attributes, it may be
useful to suppress one attribute while preserving another so that a trained
classifier does not learn spurious correlations between attributes. In this
paper we present an algorithm that finds optimal filters to give high
discriminability to one task while simultaneously giving low discriminability
to a distractor task. We present results showing the effectiveness of the
proposed technique on both simulated data and natural face images.

  memory of Alan Jeffrey",,,,"nlin.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A completely integrable nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) can be
associated with a system of linear PDEs in an auxiliary function whose
compatibility requires that the original PDE is satisfied. This associated
system is called a Lax pair. Two equivalent representations are presented. The
first uses a pair of differential operators which leads to a higher order
linear system for the auxiliary function. The second uses a pair of matrices
which leads to a first-order linear system. In this paper we present a method,
which is easily implemented in Maple or Mathematica, to compute an operator Lax
pair for a set of PDEs.
  In the operator representation, the determining equations for the Lax pair
split into a set of kinematic constraints which are independent of the original
equation and a set of dynamical equations which do depend on it. The kinematic
constraints can be solved generically. We assume that the operators have a
scaling symmetry. The dynamical equations are then reduced to a set of
nonlinear algebraic equations.
  This approach is illustrated with well-known examples from soliton theory. In
particular, it is applied to a three parameter class of fifth-order KdV-like
evolution equations which includes the Lax fifth-order KdV, Sawada-Kotera and
Kaup-Kuperschmidt equations. A second Lax pair was found for the Sawada--Kotera
equation.

a re-entry phenomenon for the PP system but not for the QA model, in full
agreement with recent computer simulation results. This finding clearly lends
support to the predictive power of the MCT for fluid-matrix systems. Finally,
the predictions of the MCT are shown to be in stark contrast with those of the
random first-order transition theory. The PP systems are thus confirmed as very
promising models for tests of theories of the glass transition.

12.5 m long free bore, enclosed inside a 10000-ton return yoke made of
construction steel. Accurate characterization of the magnetic field everywhere
in the CMS detector is required. During two major tests of the CMS magnet the

developed to describe the magnetic field everywhere outside the tracking volume

relations between the efficiency of grains in cooling the clouds, which is a
falling function of grain size, and the efficiency of grains in catalyzing the

In this paper, hitherto unexplored analogies between this type of ice cover and
two-dimensional granular gases are used to formulate a model of ice dynamics at
the floe level. The model consists of: (i) momentum equations for floe motion
between collisions, formulated in the form of a Stokes-flow problem, with
floe-size dependent time constant and equilibrium velocity, and (ii) hard-disk

particle-laden flow of $N$ disk-shaped floes with arbitrary size distribution.
The model is applied to study clustering phenomena in sea ice with power-law
floe-size distribution. In particular, the influence of the average ice
concentration $\bar{A}$ on the formation and characteristics of clusters is
analyzed in detail. The results show the existence of two regimes, at low and
high ice concentration, differing in terms of the exponents of the cluster-size
distribution and of the size of the largest cluster.

anisotropic pyramidal shaped hillocks are formed on top of the film. ii) It is

  Programming under the Distribution Semantics","31 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.AI cs.LO cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distribution semantics is one of the most prominent approaches for the
combination of logic programming and probability theory. Many languages follow
this semantics, such as Independent Choice Logic, PRISM, pD, Logic Programs
with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs) and ProbLog. When a program contains
functions symbols, the distribution semantics is well-defined only if the set
of explanations for a query is finite and so is each explanation.
Well-definedness is usually either explicitly imposed or is achieved by
severely limiting the class of allowed programs. In this paper we identify a
larger class of programs for which the semantics is well-defined together with
an efficient procedure for computing the probability of queries. Since LPADs
offer the most general syntax, we present our results for them, but our results
are applicable to all languages under the distribution semantics. We present
the algorithm ""Probabilistic Inference with Tabling and Answer subsumption""
(PITA) that computes the probability of queries by transforming a probabilistic
program into a normal program and then applying SLG resolution with answer
subsumption. PITA has been implemented in XSB and tested on six domains: two
with function symbols and four without. The execution times are compared with
those of ProbLog, cplint and CVE, PITA was almost always able to solve larger
problems in a shorter time, on domains with and without function symbols.

2-subcategory. For the local idempotent closure K^ of K, extending the
multiplication of the 2-monad Mnd, we equip these 2-categories with n possible
`weak wreath product' 2-functors Wdl^{(n)}(K^) --> Wdl^{(n-1)}(K^), such that
all of their possible n-fold composites Wdl^{(n)}(K^) --> Wdl^{(0)}(K^) are
equal; i.e. such that the weak wreath product is `associative'. Whenever
idempotent 2-cells in K split, this leads to pseudofunctors Wdl^{(n)}(K) -->
Wdl^{(n-1)}(K) obeying the associativity property up-to isomorphism. We present
a practically important occurrence of an iterated weak wreath product: the
algebra of observable quantities in an Ising type quantum spin chain where the
spins take their values in a dual pair of finite weak Hopf algebras. We also
construct a fully faithful embedding of Wdl^{(n)}(K^) into the 2-category of
commutative n+1 dimensional cubes in Mnd(K^) (hence into the 2-category of
commutative n+1 dimensional cubes in K whenever K has Eilenberg-Moore objects
and its idempotent 2-cells split). Finally we give a sufficient and necessary
condition on a monad in K^ to be isomorphic to an n-ary weak wreath product.

correlated with the black hole mass (eta Mbh^0.5). A followup study suggests
the correlation is an artifact induced by selection effects. Here we point out
there are two independent effects. The first is a sample selection effect,
which leads to a high L/L_Edd AGN sample. The second effect is the observed

  The main contribution of this paper is to present several new constant factor
approximation algorithms for energy aware scheduling problems where the
objective is to minimize weighted completion time plus the cost of the energy
consumed, in the one machine non-preemptive setting, while allowing release
dates and deadlines.Unlike previous known algorithms these new algorithms can
handle general job-dependent energy cost functions, extending the application
of these algorithms to settings outside the typical CPU-energy one. These new
settings include problems where in addition, or instead, of energy costs we
also have maintenance costs, wear and tear, replacement costs, etc., which in
general depend on the speed at which the machine runs but also depend on the
types of jobs processed. Our algorithms also extend to approximating weighted
tardiness plus energy cost, an inherently more difficult problem that has not
been addressed in the literature.

Balmer breaks of galactic spectra at z<4 and picks up red galaxies with strong
dust extinction. The photometric redshifts of KIEROs are between 1.5 and 5,
with ~70% at z~2-4. KIEROs are very massive, with M*~10^10-10^12 Msun. They are
optically faint and usually cannot be picked out by the Lyman break selection.
On the other hand, the KIERO selection includes approximately half of the known
millimeter and submillimeter galaxies in the GOODS-N. Stacking analyses in the
radio, millimeter, and submillimeter all show that KIEROs are much more
luminous than average 4.5um selected galaxies. Interestingly, the stacked
fluxes for ACS-undetected KIEROs in these wavebands are 2.5-5 times larger than
those for ACS-detected KIEROs. With the stacked radio fluxes and the local
radio-FIR correlation, we derive mean infrared luminosities of 2-7x10^12 Lsun
and mean star formation rates of 300-1200 Msun/yr for KIEROs with redshifts. We
do not find evidence of a significant subpopulation of passive KIEROs. The
large stellar masses and star formation rates imply that KIEROs are $z>2$
massive galaxies in rapid formation. Our results show that a large sample of
dusty ultraluminous sources can be selected in this way and that a large
fraction of high-redshift star formation is hidden by dust.

$m$-truncation ideals $\underline{J}_{\geq m}$ generated by the monomials of
degree $\geq m$ in a saturated strongly stable monomial ideal $\underline{J}$.
Exploiting a characterization of the ideals in $\Mf(\underline{J}_{\geq m})$ in
terms of a Buchberger-like criterion, we compute the equations defining the
$\underline{J}_{\geq m}$-marked scheme by a new reduction relation, called {\em
superminimal reduction}, and obtain an embedding of $\Mf(\underline{J}_{\geq
m})$ in an affine space of low dimension. In this setting, explicit
computations are achievable in many non-trivial cases. Moreover, for every $m$,
we give a closed embedding $\phi_m: \Mf(\underline{J}_{\geq m})\hookrightarrow
\Mf(\underline{J}_{\geq m+1})$, characterize those $\phi_m$ that are
isomorphisms in terms of the monomial basis of $\underline{J}$, especially we
characterize the minimum integer $m_0$ such that $\phi_m$ is an isomorphism for
every $m\geq m_0$.

both by the capability to develop strong vortex pinning and by the absence or
ability to overcome any strong current-limiting mechanisms of which grain
boundaries in the cuprates are a cautionary example. In this review we first
consider the positive role that grain boundary properties play in the metallic,
low temperature superconductors and then review the theoretical background and
current experimental data relating to the properties of grain boundaries in FBS
polycrystals, bi-crystal thin films, and wires. Based on this evidence, we
conclude that grain boundaries in FBS are weak linked in a qualitatively
similar way to grain boundaries in the cuprate superconductors, but also that
the effects are a little less marked. Initial experiments with the textured
substrates used for cuprate coated conductors show similar benefit for the
critical current density of FBS thin films too. We also note that the
particular richness of the pairing symmetry and the multiband parent state in
FBS may provide opportunities for grain boundary modification as a better
understanding of their pairing state and grain boundary properties are
developed.

matrix Langevin distribution) on the rotation group SO(3). In particular we
apply the holonomic gradient descent, introduced by Nakayama et al. (2011), and
a method of series expansion for evaluating the normalizing constant of the
distribution and for computing the maximum likelihood estimate. The rotation
group can be identified with the Stiefel manifold of two orthonormal vectors.
Therefore from the viewpoint of statistical modeling, it is of interest to
compare Fisher distributions on these manifolds. We illustrate the difference
with an example of near-earth objects data.

determination of meaningful global properties, that can then be used to direct
the execution of other applications. The resulting values result from the
distributed computation of functions like COUNT, SUM and AVERAGE. Some
application examples can found to determine the network size, total storage
capacity, average load, majorities and many others.
  In the last decade, many different approaches have been proposed, with
different trade-offs in terms of accuracy, reliability, message and time
complexity. Due to the considerable amount and variety of aggregation
algorithms, it can be difficult and time consuming to determine which
techniques will be more appropriate to use in specific settings, justifying the
existence of a survey to aid in this task.
  This work reviews the state of the art on distributed data aggregation
algorithms, providing three main contributions. First, it formally defines the
concept of aggregation, characterizing the different types of aggregation
functions. Second, it succinctly describes the main aggregation techniques,
organizing them in a taxonomy. Finally, it provides some guidelines toward the
selection and use of the most relevant techniques, summarizing their principal
characteristics.

The luminosity of Halpha recombination and [OII] forbidden emissions remain to
be most used in measuring formation rate of massive stars in galaxies. Here we
report the inclination dependency of continuum-subtracted and
aperture-corrected nebular luminosities, including Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma,
[OII], [NII], of disk-dominated galaxies in the local universe. Their
luminosities decrease by a factor of three from face-on to edge-on (axis ratio
limit = 0.17) orientations. This dependence is deduced to be caused by
extinction due to diffuse dust within the disks with an amplitude of 1.2 mag.
The line-luminosity--inclination relation provides a novel way to remove
extinction in emission lines and present star formation rate of disk galaxies
out to redshift of 1.6.

used in biology to represent reticulate or non-treelike evolution. Recently,
several algorithms have been developed which aim to construct phylogenetic
networks from biological data using {\em triplets}, i.e. binary phylogenetic
trees on 3-element subsets of a given set of species. However, a fundamental
problem with this approach is that the triplets displayed by a phylogenetic
network do not necessary uniquely determine or {\em encode} the network. Here
we propose an alternative approach to encoding and constructing phylogenetic
networks, which uses phylogenetic networks on 3-element subsets of a set, or
{\em trinets}, rather than triplets. More specifically, we show that for a
special, well-studied type of phylogenetic network called a 1-nested network,
the trinets displayed by a 1-nested network always encode the network. We also
present an efficient algorithm for deciding whether a {\em dense} set of
trinets (i.e. one that contains a trinet on every 3-element subset of a set)
can be displayed by a 1-nested network or not and, if so, constructs that
network. In addition, we discuss some potential new directions that this new
approach opens up for constructing and comparing phylogenetic networks.

offered by the excellent multi-wavelength coverage of a GRB with temporally
separated radiating components, we discuss several questions raised by our
observations: the nature of the prompt optical emission and the spectral
evolution of the prompt emission at high-energies (from 0.5 keV to 150 keV) ;
the origin of an X-ray flare at the beginning of the forward shock; and the
modeling of the afterglow, including the reverse shock, in the framework of the
classical fireball model.

consequences of this gap opening on the transmission are investigated. The
realization of resonant tunneling conditions is also analyzed.

April 3-5) tracked from Sun to 1 AU in remote-sensing observations of STEREO
Heliospheric Imagers and in situ plasma and magnetic field measurements. We
focus on the ICME propagation in IP space that is governed by two forces, the
propelling Lorentz force and the drag force. We address the question at which
heliospheric distance range the drag becomes dominant and the CME gets adjusted
to the solar wind flow. To this aim we analyze speed differences between ICMEs
and the ambient solar wind flow as function of distance. The evolution of the
ambient solar wind flow is derived from ENLIL 3D MHD model runs using different
solar wind models, namely Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) and MHD-Around-A-Sphere
(MAS). Comparing the measured CME kinematics with the solar wind models we find
that the CME speed gets adjusted to the solar wind speed at very different
heliospheric distances in the three events under study: from below 30 Rs, to
beyond 1 AU, depending on the CME and ambient solar wind characteristics. ENLIL
can be used to derive important information about the overall structure of the
background solar wind, providing more reliable results during times of low
solar activity than during times of high solar activity. The results from this
study enable us to get a better insight into the forces acting on CMEs over the
IP space distance range, which is an important prerequisite in order to predict
their 1 AU transit times.

platelet was investigated using time-resolved scanning transmission x-ray
microscopy and micromagnetic simulations. The response of the vortex core on an
in-plane oscillating magnetic field was studied as a function of the excitation
frequency and amplitude. Non-linear behavior was observed in the form of a
redshift of the gyrotropic resonance. I.e., when the excitation amplitude was
increased, the resonance frequency was found to decrease. The nonlinearity is
in agreement with extensive micromagnetic simulations. This work complements
previous reports on thinner nanostructures where a frequency blueshift was
observed.

particles in the universe are divided into three classes: the subluminal,
luminal and superluminal particles by the speed of light, their energy-momenum
relations are E2 = m2c4 + c2p2, E2 = c2p2, and E2 + m2c4 = c2p2, respectively.
The Einstein's theory of relativity still holds and is consummated by the
existence of superluminal particles, and the Lorentz symmetry of the spacetime
is also not violated. There should have two sets of inertial reference systems:
subluminal and superluminal reference systems. Two inertial reference systems
in each set are linked by Lorentz transformations, but superluminal coordinate
transformations between the two sets do not exist in the 1+3 dimensional
spacetime. So the physical laws have different expressions in the two sets of
inertial reference systems, the principle of special relativity should be
revised.
