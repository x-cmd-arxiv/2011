communicate, both for individuals and for groups through the use of hashtags
that denote topics of conversation. However, groups can be easily blocked from
communicating through blocking of posts with the given hashtags. We propose
#h00t, a system for censorship resistant microblogging. #h00t presents an
interface that is much like Twitter, except that hashtags are replaced with
very short hashes (e.g., 24 bits) of the group identifier. Naturally, with such
short hashes, hashtags from different groups may collide and #h00t users will
actually seek to create collisions. By encrypting all posts with keys derived
from the group identifiers, #h00t client software can filter out other groups'
posts while making such filtering difficult for the adversary. In essence, by
leveraging collisions, groups can tunnel their posts in other groups' posts. A
censor could not block a given group without also blocking the other groups
with colliding hashtags. We evaluate the feasibility of #h00t through traces
collected from Twitter, showing that a single modern computer has enough
computational throughput to encrypt every tweet sent through Twitter in real
time. We also use these traces to analyze the bandwidth and anonymity tradeoffs
that would come with different variations on how group identifiers are encoded

suggest a non-collisional mechanism for the BSS formation, from the evolution
of primordial binaries. This scenario is also supported by the results of new
dynamical simulations presented here. Both galaxies coincide with the
relationship between the BSS frequency and the absolute visual magnitude Mv
found by Momany et al (2007). If this relationship is confirmed by larger

coordinates the power in each element of the tensor has a unique dependence on
the angle between the magnetic field and velocity of the solar wind (\theta)
and the angle of the vector in the plane perpendicular to the velocity (\phi).
We derive the geometrical effect of the high speed flow of the solar wind past
the spacecraft on the power spectrum in the frame of the plasma P(k) to arrive
at the observed power spectrum P(f,\theta,\phi) based on a scalar field
description of turbulence theory. This allows us to predict the variation in
the \phi direction and compare it to the data. We then transform the
observations from RTN coordinates to magnetic-field-aligned coordinates. The
observed reduced power spectral tensor matches the theoretical predictions we
derive in both RTN and field-aligned coordinates which means that the local
magnetic field we calculate with wavelet envelope functions is an accurate
representation of the physical axis of symmetry for the turbulence and implies
that on average the turbulence is axi-symmetric. We also show that we can
separate the dominant toroidal component of the turbulence from the smaller but
significant poloidal component and that these have different power anisotropy.
We also conclude that the magnetic helicity is anisotropic and mostly
two-dimensional, arising from wavevectors largely confined to the plane
perpendicular to B.

for applications like electronic health records systems (EHRs) to collect
access logs, which record each time a user (e.g., a hospital employee) accesses
a piece of sensitive data (e.g., a patient record). Using the access log, it is
easy to answer simple queries (e.g., Who accessed Alice's medical record?), but
this often does not provide enough information. In addition to learning who
accessed their medical records, patients will likely want to understand why
each access occurred. In this paper, we introduce the problem of generating
explanations for individual records in an access log. The problem is motivated
by user-centric auditing applications, and it also provides a novel approach to
misuse detection. We develop a framework for modeling explanations which is
based on a fundamental observation: For certain classes of databases, including
EHRs, the reason for most data accesses can be inferred from data stored
elsewhere in the database. For example, if Alice has an appointment with Dr.
Dave, this information is stored in the database, and it explains why Dr. Dave
looked at Alice's record. Large numbers of data accesses can be explained using
general forms called explanation templates. Rather than requiring an
administrator to manually specify explanation templates, we propose a set of
algorithms for automatically discovering frequent templates from the database
(i.e., those that explain a large number of accesses). We also propose
techniques for inferring collaborative user groups, which can be used to
enhance the quality of the discovered explanations. Finally, we have evaluated
our proposed techniques using an access log and data from the University of
Michigan Health System. Our results demonstrate that in practice we can provide
explanations for over 94% of data accesses in the log.

In theory, proof systems can give the necessary assurance, but prior work is
not sufficiently scalable or practical. In this paper, we develop new proof
protocols for verifying computations which are streaming in nature: the
verifier (data owner) needs only logarithmic space and a single pass over the
input, and after observing the input follows a simple protocol with a prover
(service provider) that takes logarithmic communication spread over a
logarithmic number of rounds. These ensure that the computation is performed
correctly: that the service provider has not made any errors or missed out some
data. The guarantee is very strong: even if the service provider deliberately
tries to cheat, there is only vanishingly small probability of doing so
undetected, while a correct computation is always accepted. We first observe
that some theoretical results can be modified to work with streaming verifiers,
showing that there are efficient protocols for problems in the complexity
classes NP and NC. Our main results then seek to bridge the gap between theory
and practice by developing usable protocols for a variety of problems of
central importance in streaming and database processing. All these problems
require linear space in the traditional streaming model, and therefore our
protocols demonstrate that adding a prover can exponentially reduce the effort
needed by the verifier. Our experimental results show that our protocols are

vertically and minimizes I/Os by dynamically adjusting the horizontal
partitions independently for each vertical partition, based on the evolving
shape of the tree and the available memory. Where appropriate, ERa also groups
vertical partitions together to amortize the I/O cost. We developed a serial
version; a parallel version for shared-memory and shared-disk multi-core
systems; and a parallel version for shared-nothing architectures. ERa indexes
the entire human genome in 19 minutes on an ordinary desktop computer. For

exclusively on the social graph, overlooking historical data, i.e., traces of
past action propagations. In this paper, we study influence maximization from a
novel data-based perspective. In particular, we introduce a new model, which we
call credit distribution, that directly leverages available propagation traces
to learn how influence flows in the network and uses this to estimate expected
influence spread. Our approach also learns the different levels of
influenceability of users, and it is time-aware in the sense that it takes the
temporal nature of influence into account. We show that influence maximization
under the credit distribution model is NP-hard and that the function that
defines expected spread under our model is submodular. Based on these, we
develop an approximation algorithm for solving the influence maximization
problem that at once enjoys high accuracy compared to the standard approach,
while being several orders of magnitude faster and more scalable.

magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) as a function of color,
allowing this widely adopted filter to be used for distance measurements. We
find a clear trend between NIR RGB color and metallicity. However, it appears
unlikely that the slope of the NIR RGB can be used as a metallicity indicator
in extragalactic systems with comparable data. Finally, we discuss scattered
light in the WFC3, which becomes significant for exposures taken close to a

we describe these searches and their resulting discoveries. We then discuss
radio timing algorithms and the spin-down properties of the 19 RRATs with

effect. Spintronics describes the transport of charge and angular momentum by
making use of separate spin-up and spin-down channels. Recently, the merger of
thermoelectricity with spintronics has given rise to a novel and rich research
field named spin caloritronics. Here, we report the first direct experimental
observation of refrigeration/heating driven by a spin current, a new spin
thermoelectric effect which we call the spin Peltier effect. The heat flow is
generated by the spin dependency of the Peltier coefficient inside the
ferromagnetic material. We explored the effect in a specifically designed spin
valve pillar structure by measuring the temperature using an electrically
isolated thermocouple. The difference in heat flow between the two magnetic
configurations leads to a change in temperature. With the help of 3-D finite

of -0.9 to -1.3 mV. These results enable magnetic control of heat flow and

possibilistic knowledge-based semantics to define policy satisfaction such that

electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveal their atomic arrangement. Mechanism of such

wrinkles) is revealed. It is shown that disappearance of the multistep island
leads to the creation of wrinkles in the graphene layers. The density
functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that the diffusion of both
silicon and carbon atoms is possible on a Si-terminated SiC surface at a high
temperature close to 1600{\deg}C. The creation of buffer layer at the
Si-terminated surface effectively blocks horizontal diffusion, preventing
growth of thick graphene layer at this face. At the carbon terminated SiC
surface, the buffer layer is absent leaving space for effective horizontal
diffusion of both silicon and carbon atoms. DFT results show that excess carbon
atoms converts a topmost carbon layer to sp2 bonded configuration, liberating
Si atoms in barrierless process. The silicon atoms escape through the channels
created at the bending layers defects, while the carbon atoms are incorporated
into the growing graphene layers. These results explain growth of thick
graphene underneath existing graphene cover and also the creation of the

connecting exciton, bi-exciton and tri-exciton complexes are derived and an
intuitive picture of breaking neutral multi-exction complexes into positively
and negatively charged multi-exciton complexes is given. The general approach
is illustrated by analyzing the coupling of biexciton and exciton in CdSe
spherical nanocrystals. The electron and hole states are computed using
atomistic $sp^3d^5s^*$ tight binding Hamiltonian including an effective crystal
field splitting and surface passivation. For each number of electron-hole pairs
the many-body spectrum is computed in the configuration-interaction approach.
The low-energy correlated biexciton levels are broken into charged complexes: a
hole and a negatively charged trion and an electron and a positively charged
trion. Out of a highly excited exciton spectrum a subspace coupled to
bi-exciton levels via Auger processes is identified. The interaction between
correlated bi-exciton and exciton states is treated using exact diagonalization
techniques. This allows to extract the spectral function of the biexciton and
relate its characteristic width and amplitude to the characteristic amplitude
and timescale of the coherent time evolution of the coupled system. It is shown
that this process can be described by the Fermi's Golden Rule only if a fast
relaxation of the excitonic subsystem is accounted for.

depends on both the strength of the screened disorder potential and the
strength of electron-electron correlations, and the Anderson localization
length can be extracted from the scaling of the current with system size. At
half filling, the persistent current is reduced by strong correlations when the
interaction strength is large. Surprisingly, we find that the disorder

averaging of ellipsoidal galaxy clusters. We specifically consider applications
to hydrostatic X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) studies, though many of the
results also apply to isotropic dispersion-supported stellar dynamical systems.
Here we present analytical formulas for galaxy clusters described by a
gravitational potential that is a triaxial ellipsoid of constant shape and
orientation. For this model type we show that the mass bias due to spherically
averaging X-ray observations is independent of the temperature profile, and for
the special case of a scale-free logarithmic potential, there is exactly zero
mass bias for any shape, orientation, and temperature profile. The ratio of
spherically averaged intracluster medium (ICM) pressures obtained from SZ and
X-ray measurements depends only on the ICM intrinsic shape, projection
orientation, and H_0, which provides another illustration of how cluster
geometry can be recovered through a combination of X-ray and SZ measurements.
We also demonstrate that Y_SZ and Y_X have different biases owing to spherical
averaging, which leads to an offset in the spherically averaged Y_SZ - Y_X
relation. A potentially useful application of the analytical formulas presented
is to assess the error range of an observable (e.g., mass, Y_SZ) accounting for
deviations from assumed spherical symmetry, without having to perform the
ellipsoidal deprojection explicitly. Finally, for dedicated ellipsoidal
studies, we also generalize the spherical onion peeling method to the triaxial
case for a given shape and orientation.

usually manifests itself in a space-out, time-out, or one component of the
verification tool giving up; in all of these failing cases, significant
computation is performed by the verification tool before the failure, but no
result is reported. We propose to reformulate the model-checking problem as
follows, in order to have the verification tool report a summary of the
performed work even in case of failure: given a program and a specification,
the model checker returns a condition P ---usually a state predicate--- such
that the program satisfies the specification under the condition P ---that is,
as long as the program does not leave states in which P is satisfied. We are of
course interested in model checkers that return conditions P that are as weak
as possible. Instead of outcome (1), the model checker will return P = true;
instead of (2), the condition P will return the part of the state space that
satisfies the specification; and in case (3), the condition P can summarize the
work that has been performed by the model checker before space-out, time-out,

verification method or tool may be used to focus on the states that violate the
condition. We give such conditions as input to a conditional model checker,
such that the verification problem is restricted to the part of the state space
that satisfies the condition. Our experiments show that repeated application of
conditional model checkers, using different conditions, can significantly
improve the verification results, state-space coverage, and performance.

largest scales in the system to form a pair of coherent vortices known as the
Bose condensate. We show, both numerically and analytically, that the energy
condensation saturates and the system reaches a statistically stationary state.
The time scale of saturation is inversely proportional to the viscosity and the
saturation energy level is determined by both the viscosity and the force. We
further show that, without sufficient resolution to resolve the small-scale
enstrophy spectrum, numerical simulations can give a spurious result for the
saturation energy level. We also find that the movement of the condensate is
similar to the motion of an inertial particle with an effective drag force.
Furthermore, we show that the profile of the saturated coherent vortices can be
described by a Gaussian core with exponential wings.

self-organised map (SOM) - as a tool for visualising, exploring and mining the
catalogues of large astronomical surveys. Self-organisation culminates in a
low-resolution representation of the 'topology' of a parameter volume, and this
can be exploited in various ways pertinent to astronomy. Using data from the
Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS), we demonstrate two key astronomical
applications of the SOM: (i) object classification and selection, using the
example of galaxies with active galactic nuclei as a demonstration, and (ii)
photometric redshift estimation, illustrating how SOMs can be used as totally
empirical predictive tools. With a training set of ~3800 galaxies with
z_spec<1, we achieve photometric redshift accuracies competitive with other
(mainly template fitting) techniques that use a similar number of photometric
bands (sigma(Dz)=0.03 with a ~2% outlier rate when using u*-band to 8um
photometry). We also test the SOM as a photo-z tool using the PHoto-z Accuracy
Testing (PHAT) synthetic catalogue of Hildebrandt et al. (2010), which compares
several different photo-z codes using a common input/training set. We find that
the SOM can deliver accuracies that are competitive with many of the
established template-fitting and empirical methods. This technique is not
without clear limitations, which are discussed, but we suggest it could be a
powerful tool in the era of extremely large - 'petabyte' - databases where
efficient data-mining is a paramount concern.

rich and complex, and is predicted to contain very high densities of dark
matter. Utilizing three years of data from the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope
(and the recently available Pass 7 ultraclean event class), we study the
morphology and spectrum of the gamma ray emission from this region and find
evidence of a spatially extended component which peaks at energies between 300
MeV and 10 GeV. We compare our results to those reported by other groups and
find good agreement. The extended emission could potentially originate from
either the annihilations of dark matter particles in the inner galaxy, or from
the collisions of high energy protons that are accelerated by the Milky Way's
supermassive black hole with gas. If interpreted as dark matter annihilation
products, the emission spectrum favors dark matter particles with a mass in the
range of 7-12 GeV (if annihilating dominantly to leptons) or 25-45 GeV (if
annihilating dominantly to hadronic final states). The intensity of the
emission corresponds to a dark matter annihilation cross section consistent
with that required to generate the observed cosmological abundance in the early
universe (sigma v ~ 3 x 10^-26 cm^3/s). We also present conservative limits on
the dark matter annihilation cross section which are at least as stringent as
those derived from other observations.

[NeIII]{\lambda}3869, and [OII]{\lambda}{\lambda}3726 + 3729 and can be used

BPT-AGN as TBT-AGN and 97% of the SDSS BPT-SF as TBT-SF. Furthermore, it
identifies 97% of the OPTX Chandra X-ray selected AGNs as TBT-AGN. This is in
contrast to the BPT diagram, which misidentifies 20% of X-ray selected AGNs as
BPT-SF. We use the GOODS-N and Lockman Hole galaxy samples, with their
accompanying deep Chandra imaging, to perform X-ray and infrared stacking
analyses to further validate our TBT-AGN and TBT-SF selections; that is, we
verify the dominance of AGN activity in the former and star formation activity
in the latter. Finally, we address the inclusion of the majority of the
BPT-comp (sources lying between the BPT-SF and BPT-AGN regimes) in our TBT-AGN
regime. We find that the stacked BPT-comp source is X-ray hard (<{\Gamma}eff> =
1.0 +/-0.4) and has a high X-ray luminosity to total infrared luminosity ratio.
This suggests that, on average, the X-ray signal in BPT-comp is dominated by
obscured or low accretion rate AGN activity rather than by star formation,
supporting their inclusion in the TBT-AGN regime.

given sufficient smoothness, performs significantly better than the
piecewise-linear basis. The underlying generalised sparse grid algorithm
greedily selects the dimensions and variable interactions that contribute most
to the variability of a function. The hierarchical surplus of points within the
sparse grid is used as an error criterion for local refinement with the aim of
concentrating computational effort within rapidly varying or discontinuous
regions. This approach limits the number of points that are invested in
`unimportant' dimensions and regions within the high-dimensional domain. We
show the utility of the proposed method for non-smooth functions with hundreds

It brightened by about 1.5 magnitudes in B within a year starting in 1942, and
then slowly faded back to its pre-outburst brightness from 1943 to the 1950s.
The mean brightness level was stable before and after the outburst, and
ellipsoidal variations with a period of $P=119.18\pm0.07$ days are seen,
suggesting that the star is tidally distorted. Radial-velocity measurements
indicate that the orbit is nearly circular ($e=0.02\pm0.01$) with a
spectroscopic period that is the same as the photometric period. The binary
consists of a $1.1\pm0.3 M_\odot$ M0III star, and a $0.6\pm0.2 M_\odot$
companion, very likely a white dwarf (WD). Unlike other symbiotic binaries,
there is no sign of emission lines or a stellar wind in the spectra. With an
outburst timescale of ~10 years and estimated B band peak luminosity M_B~0.7,
J0757 is different from any other known classic or symbiotic novae. The most
probable explanation of the outburst is Hydrogen shell-burning on the WD,
although an accretion-powered flare cannot be ruled out.

  Abstract: Following Sam Payne's work, we study the existence problem of
nontrivial vector bundles on toric varieties. The first result we prove is that
every complete fan admits a nontrivial conewise linear multivalued function.
Such functions could potentially be the Chern classes of toric vector bundles.
Then we use the results of Corti\~nas, Haesemeyer, Walker and Weibel to show
that the (non-equivariant) Grothendieck group of the toric 3-fold studied by
Payne is large, so the variety has a nontrivial vector bundle. Using the same
computation, we show that every toric 3-fold X either has a nontrivial line
bundle, or there is a finite surjective toric morphism from Y to X, such that Y
has a large Grothendieck group.

initial process responsible for star formation. In contrast to previous SFR
theories, the present one does not invoke an ad-hoc density threshold for star
formation; instead, the SFR {\it continuously} increases with gas density,
naturally yielding two different characteristic regimes, thus two different
slopes in the SFR vs gas density relationship, in agreement with observational
determinations. Besides the complete SFR derivation, we also provide a
simplified expression, which reproduces reasonably well the complete
calculations and can easily be used for quick determinations of SFR's in cloud
environments. A key property at the heart of both our complete and simplified
theory is that the SFR involves a {\it density-dependent dynamical time},
characteristic of each collapsing (prestellar) overdense region in the cloud,
instead of one single mean or critical freefall timescale. Unfortunately, the
SFR also depends on some ill determined parameters, such as the core-to-star
mass conversion efficiency and the crossing timescale. Although we provide
estimates for these parameters, their uncertainty hampers a precise
quantitative determination of the SFR, within less than a factor of a few.

decisions based on one realization of a random data matrix X. M is typically
large and X will usually have M rows associated with each of the M decisions to
make, but for each row the data may be low dimensional. A Bayesian
decision-theoretic approach for this problem is implemented with the overall
loss function being a cost-weighted linear combination of Type I and Type II
loss functions. The class of loss functions considered allows for the use of
the false discovery rate (FDR), false nondiscovery rate (FNR), and missed
discovery rate (MDR) in assessing the decision. Through this Bayesian paradigm,
the Bayes multiple decision function (BMDF) is derived and an efficient
algorithm to obtain the optimal Bayes action is described. In contrast to many
works in the literature where the rows of the matrix X are assumed to be
stochastically independent, we allow in this paper a dependent data structure
with the associations obtained through a class of frailty-induced Archimedean
copulas. In particular, non-Gaussian dependent data structure, which is the
norm rather than the exception when dealing with failure-time data, can be
entertained. The numerical implementation of the determination of the Bayes
optimal action is facilitated through sequential Monte Carlo techniques. The
main theory developed could also be extended to the problem of multiple
hypotheses testing, multiple classification and prediction, and
high-dimensional variable selection. The proposed procedure is illustrated for
the simple versus simple and for the composite hypotheses setting via
simulation studies. The procedure is also applied to a subset of a real
microarray data set from a colon cancer study.

site with an aliovalent ion (indirect doping), which had been unsuccessful by

film growth process. The substitution with La was substantiated by a systematic
shrinkage of the c-axis lattice parameter due to the smaller ionic radius of
La3+ than that of Ba2+. A negative Hall coefficient indicated that the majority
carriers were electrons, as is consistent with this aliovalent ion doping. The
La substitution suppressed an antiferromagnetic transition and induced bulk
superconductivity at a maximum onset critical temperature (Tc) of 22.4 K. The
electronic phase diagram for (Ba1-xLax)Fe2As2 was built, which revealed that
the indirect electron doping at the Ba site with La [(Ba1-xLax)Fe2As2] exhibits
almost the same Tc - doping level relation as that of the direct
electron-doping at the Fe site with Co [Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2]. This finding
clarified that Tc in 122-type compounds is not affected by a crystallographic
doping site, which is in sharp contrast to the 1111-type compounds, REFeAsO (RE

dimensionality of electronic structures and electron pairing symmetries.

in relation to progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The WD mass can be
estimated from light curve analysis in multiwavelength bands based on the
optically thick wind theory. In the single degenerate scenario of SNe Ia, two
main channels are known, i.e., WD + main sequence (MS) channel and WD + red
giant (RG) channel. In each channel, a typical binary undergoes three
evolutional stages before explosion, i.e., the wind phase, supersoft X-ray
source (SSS) phase, and recurrent nova phase in order of time because the
accretion rate decreases with time as the companion mass decreases. We can
specify some accreting WDs as the corresponding stage of evolution.
Intermittent supersoft X-ray source like RX J0513.9-6951 and V Sge are
corresponding to the wind phase objects. For the SSS phase Cal 87-type objects
correspond to the WD+MS channel. For the WD + RG channel, soft X-ray
observations of early type galaxies gave a statistical evidence of SSS phase
binaries. Recurrent novae of U Sco-type and RS Oph-type correspond to the WD +
MS channel and WD + RG channel, respectively. Majority of recurrent novae host
a very massive WD (~> 1.35 Mo) and often show a plateau phase in optical light
curve correspondingly to the long lasted supersoft X-ray phase: These
properties are indications of increasing WD masses.

Recent observations of SSX flux of early type galaxies show a remarkable
agreement with theoretical prediction of SD scenario, which is thus turn to be
a strong support for SD scenario, despite the original observation aimed at the
opposite conclusion. Here I explain why X-ray fluxes are so weak in early type
of galaxies: (1) Candidate binaries in SD scenario become supersoft X-ray
source only in a short time on its way to an SN Ia explosion, because it spend
a large part of lifetime as wind phase, (2) During the supersoft X-ray phase,
symbiotic stars emit very weak SSX fluxes even if the WD is very massive. It

states that a curve of genus greater than one over any number field has only
finitely many points. Again a natural question is how many points can such a
curve have. Caporaso, Harris, and Mazur [CHM97] have shown that the weak
Bombieri-Lang conjecture implies that for any number field $F$ and any integer
$g \ge 2$ there is an absolute upper bound $B(F; g)$ on the number of points on
a genus $g$ curve over $F$. Furthermore, the strong Bombieri-Lang conjecture
implies that for each genus $g \ge 2$, there is an absolute bound $C(g)$
depending on the genus -- but not on the field -- such that over any number
field, only finitely many curves of genus $g$ have more than $C(g)$ points.
Again we can ask what those two bounds are and, as it turns out, it helps to
consider families that come from K3 surfaces. Specifically, we will consider
the case $g = 2$. We use a K3 surface $X$ that is a double cover of $P^2$
ramified over a smooth sextic curve $C$, so every pencil of lines gives us a
family of genus 2 curves. Any line that is tangent to $C$ at 3 points will lift
to a pair of curves on $X$ that become sections of the family given by any
pencil of lines. In section 3 we will construct an K3 surface (over a number
field) and corresponding sextic with 64 such tritangents. Furthermore, there
will turn out to be other rational curves in $P^2$ of higher degree that also
meet $C$ only at tangent points. By suitably choosing the pencil and performing
suitable base changes we find a family of genus 2 curves with 226 sections.
This is the current best record, the previous [Elk06] being 150 sections, which
remains the record for a family over $\Q$.

relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the impact of
multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA Phase and
all these network coding maps should satisfy a requirement called the {\it
exclusive law}. We highlight the issues associated with the scheme proposed by
Koike-Akino et al. and propose a scheme which solves these issues. We show that
every network coding map that satisfies the exclusive law is representable by a
Latin Square and conversely, and this relationship can be used to get the
network coding maps satisfying the exclusive law. Using the structural
properties of the Latin Squares for a given set of parameters, the problem of
finding all the required maps is reduced to finding a small set of maps for
$M-$PSK constellations. This is achieved using the notions of isotopic and
transposed Latin Squares. Even though, the completability of partially filled
$M \times M$ Latin Square using $M$ symbols is an open problem, two specific
cases where such a completion is always possible are identified and explicit
construction procedures are provided. The Latin Squares constructed using the
first procedure, helps towards reducing the total number of network coding maps
used. The second procedure helps in the construction of certain Latin Squares
for $M$-PSK signal set from the Latin squares obtained for $M/2$-PSK signal
set.

boson masses arises significantly from a fermiophobic source. To minimize
flavor violation, the fermion mass generation is still due to one light doublet
scalar. One of the realizations is the Bosonic Technicolor model. In these
scenarios, the Yukawa couplings between the light scalar and the standard model
fermions are in general enhanced while the couplings between the light scalar
and weak gauge bosons are reduced. Even though the flavor violation induced by
the neutral scalar at the tree level can be avoided, the charged scalar state
inevitably mediate flavor changing neutral current processes. With the
enhancement in the Yukawa couplings, one expects serious constraints of such
models from flavor violating effects. We find that the most severe bound comes
from neutral meson mixing of $B^{0}_{d}-\bar{B^{0}_{d}}$. Large parameter space
is excluded if the weak gauge boson mass generation is dominated by the
fermophobic sector. However, the correlation between the Yukawa coupling and
charged scalar mass show that a factor of two enhancement in top Yukawa
coupling is still allowed for charged scalar heavier than 500 GeV. We use this
as a benchmark point to study the phenomenology of the light scalar. It is
interesting that the destructive interference between the top quark loop and
the $W$-boson loop in the di-photon channel becomes significant and makes the
channel negligible. In the light scalar region, the search becomes much more
challenging than the conventional SM Higgs boson.

of this study is to investigate the influence of metallicity on the mass-loss

  The luminosity of the star is a crucial parameter for the radiative driven
stellar wind. Many efforts have been invested to constrain the AGB mass-loss
rate, but most of the previous studies use Galactic objects, which have poorly
known distances, thus their luminosities. To overcome this problem, we have
studied mass loss from AGB stars in the Galaxies of the Local Group. The
distance to the stars have been independently measured, thus AGB stars in these
galaxies are ideal for understanding the mass-loss rate. Moreover, these
galaxies have a lower metallicity than the Milky Way, providing an ideal target
to study the influence of metallicity on the mass-loss rate.
  We report our analysis of mass loss, using the Spitzer Space Telescope and
the Herschel Space Observatory. We will discuss the influence of AGB mass-loss
on stellar evolution, and explore AGB and PN contribution to the lifecycle of
matter in galaxies.

investigating the kinematics of tritium beta-decay with a sensitivity of 200
meV/c2. The measurement setup consists of a high luminosity windowless gaseous
molecular tritium source (WGTS), a differential and cryogenic pumped electron
transport and tritium retention section, a tandem spectrometer section
(pre-spectrometer and main spectrometer) for energy analysis, followed by a
detector system for counting transmitted beta-decay electrons. To achieve the
desired sensitivity, the WGTS, in which tritium decays with an activity of
about 10e11 Bq, needs to be stable on the 0.1 % level in injection pressure and
temperature at an absolute value of about 30 K. With the capability to create
an axial magnetic field of 3.6 T the WGTS is going to be one of the world's
most complex superconducting magnet and cryostat systems. The main spectrometer
(length 24 m, diameter 10 m), which works as a retarding electrostatic
spectrometer, will have an energy resolution of 0.93 eV at 18.6 keV. For the
precise energy analysis at the tritium endpoint, a retarding potential of -18.6
kV is needed with 1 ppm stability. To reach the background level needed to
achieve the sensitivity, it will be operated at a pressure of 10e-11 mbar. This
article will give an overview of the KATRIN experiment and its current status.

system is linear and autonomous and satisfies the classical normality
assumption, we improve the well known result on the strict convexity of the
reachable set from the origin by giving a polynomial estimate. The result is
based on a careful analysis of the switching function. We extend this result to
nonautonomous linear systems, provided the time dependent system is not too far
from the autonomous system obtained by taking the time to be 0 in the dynamics.
Using a linearization approach, we prove a bang-bang principle, valid in
dimensions 2 and 3 for a class of nonlinear systems, affine and symmetric with
respect to the control. Moreover we show that, for two dimensional systems, the
reachable set from the origin satisfies the same polynomial strict convexity
property as for the linearized dynamics, provided the nonlinearity is small
enough. Finally, under the same assumptions we show that the epigraph of the
minimum time function has positive reach, hence proving the first result of
this type in a nonlinear setting. In all the above results, we require that the
linearization at the origin be normal. We provide examples showing the

branched along Maschke's octic surface. This surface is defined by the lowest
degree invariant of a certain finite group acting on a four dimensional vector
space. Using this group, we show that the middle Betti cohomology group of the
threefold decomposes into the direct sum of 150 two-dimensional Hodge
substructures. We exhibit one dimensional families of rational curves on the
threefold and verify that the associated Abel-Jacobi map is non-trivial. By
counting the number of points over finite fields, we determine the rank of the
N\'eron-Severi group of Maschke's surface and the Galois representation on the
transcendental lattice of some of its quotients. We also formulate precise
conjectures on the modularity of the Galois representations associated to
Maschke's threefold and to a genus 33 curve which parametrizes rational curves
in the threefold.

stereopsis, visual odometry, or invariant recognition, is establishing
correspondences between images or between images and data from other
modalities. We present an analysis of the role that multiplicative interactions
play in learning such correspondences, and we show how learning and inferring
relationships between images can be viewed as detecting rotations in the
eigenspaces shared among a set of orthogonal matrices. We review a variety of
recent multiplicative sparse coding methods in light of this observation. We
also review how the squaring operation performed by energy models and by models
of complex cells can be thought of as a way to implement multiplicative
interactions. This suggests that the main utility of including complex cells in
computational models of vision may be that they can encode relations not
invariances.

considered as a quantum two-body system, immersed in an arbitrary background
gravitational field described by Einstein's General Relativity is presented.
Working with Fermi normal coordinates for a freely falling observer in a
spacetime region where there are no background sources and ignoring the
gravitational back-reaction of the system, the effective Coulomb-Breit
Hamiltonian is obtained starting from the S-matrix element corresponding to the
one-photon exchange between the charged fermionic currents. The contributions
due to retardation are considered up to order (v/c)^2 and they are subsequently
written as effective operators in the relativistic quantum mechanical Hilbert
space of the system. The final Hamiltonian includes effects linear in the
curvature and up to order (v/c)^2.

bounding processes for the Brownian path. We develop such processes with
particular emphasis on being able to unbiasedly simulate them on a personal
computer. The dominating processes converge almost surely in the supremum and
$L_1$ norms. In particular, the rate of converge in $L_1$ is of the order
$\mathcal {O}(\mathcal{K}^{-1/2})$, $\mathcal{K}$ denoting the computing cost.
The a.s. enfolding of the Brownian path can be exploited in Monte Carlo
applications involving Brownian paths whence our algorithm (termed the
$\varepsilon$-strong algorithm) can deliver unbiased Monte Carlo estimators
over path expectations, overcoming discretisation errors characterising
standard approaches. We will show analytical results from applications of the
$\varepsilon$-strong algorithm for estimating expectations arising in option
pricing. We will also illustrate that individual steps of the algorithm can be
of separate interest, giving new simulation methods for interesting Brownian
distributions.

with unprecedented sensitivity that was installed into the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) in May 2009, during HST Servicing Mission 4 (STS-125). We
present the design philosophy and summarize the key characteristics of the
instrument that will be of interest to potential observers. For faint targets,
with flux F_lambda ~ 1.0E10-14 ergs/s/cm2/Angstrom, COS can achieve comparable
signal to noise (when compared to STIS echelle modes) in 1-2% of the observing
time. This has led to a significant increase in the total data volume and data
quality available to the community. For example, in the first 20 months of
science operation (September 2009 - June 2011) the cumulative redshift
pathlength of extragalactic sight lines sampled by COS is 9 times that sampled
at moderate resolution in 19 previous years of Hubble observations. COS
programs have observed 214 distinct lines of sight suitable for study of the
intergalactic medium as of June 2011. COS has measured, for the first time with
high reliability, broad Lya absorbers and Ne VIII in the intergalactic medium,
and observed the HeII reionization epoch along multiple sightlines. COS has
detected the first CO emission and absorption in the UV spectra of low-mass
circumstellar disks at the epoch of giant planet formation, and detected
multiple ionization states of metals in extra-solar planetary atmospheres. In
the coming years, COS will continue its census of intergalactic gas, probe
galactic and cosmic structure, and explore physics in our solar system and
Galaxy.
