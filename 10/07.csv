we present a simple thermodynamic model, where the deeply supercooled liquid is
assumed to be a mixture of solid-like and liquid-like micro regions. The mole
fraction of the liquid-like regions controls the thermodynamic properties of
the supercooled liquid while that of the solid-like regions controls its
relaxation time or viscosity. From the universal temperature dependence of the
molar excess entropy for the deeply supercooled liquids, we derive the
temperature dependence of the mole fraction of the liquid-like regions to
obtain the universal temperature dependence of the relaxation time or the
viscosity for the deeply supercooled liquids. A central parameter of our model
is then shown to be a measure for the fragility of a supercooled liquid. We
also suggest a way to test our physical picture of deeply supercooled liquids
by means of molecular dynamics simulations of model liquids.

(a) While the action for a relativistic free particle is invariant under the
Lorentz transformation, the corresponding action for a non-relativistic free
particle is not invariant under the Galilean transformation, but picks up extra
contributions at the end points. This leads to an extra phase in the
non-relativistic wave function under a Galilean transformation, which can be
related to the rest energy of the particle even in the non-relativistic limit.
(b) We show how the solution to the generally covariant Klein-Gordon equation
in a non-inertial frame, which has a time-dependent acceleration, reduces to
the quantum mechanical wave function in the presence of an appropriate
(time-dependent) gravitational field, in the non-relativistic limit. The extra
phase acquired by the non-relativistic wave function in an accelerated frame
actually arises from the gravitational time dilation and survives in the
non-relativistic limit. (c) We provide a detailed description of the
non-relativistic limit of the Feynman propagator in a weak gravitational field,

concatenation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers near a linear interface
separating oil and water acting as solvents. The configurations of the
copolymer are directed paths that can move above and below the interface. The
interaction
  Hamiltonian, which rewards matches and penalizes mismatches of the monomers
and the solvents, depends on two parameters: the interaction strength
$\beta\geq 0$ and the interaction bias $h \geq 0$. The quenched excess free
energy per monomer $(\beta,h) \mapsto g^\mathrm{que} (\beta,h)$ has a phase
transition along a quenched critical curve $\beta \mapsto
h^\mathrm{que}_c(\beta)$ separating a localized phase, where the copolymer
stays close to the interface, from a delocalized phase, where the copolymer
wanders away from the interface.
  We derive a variational expression for $g^\mathrm{que}(\beta,h)$ by applying
the quenched large deviation principle for the empirical process of words cut
out from a random letter sequence according to a random renewal process. We
compare this variational expression with its annealed analogue, describing the
annealed excess free energy $(\beta,h) \mapsto g^\mathrm{ann}(\beta,h)$, which
has a phase transition along an annealed critical curve $\beta \mapsto

distributions and directed paths. We show that
$g^\mathrm{que}(\beta,h)<g^\mathrm{ann}(\beta,h)$ for all $(\beta,h)$ in the

$h^\mathrm{ann}_c(\beta\alpha)<h^\mathrm{que}_c

are inherently linked to its user basis through a direct channel that has no

calibrated with standard logistic growth models and allows for reliable
extrapolations of the size of the business at long time horizons. We illustrate
the methodology with a detailed analysis of facebook, one of the biggest of the
social-media giants. There is a clear signature of a change of regime that
occurred in 2010 on the growth of the number of users, from a pure exponential
behavior (a paradigm for unlimited growth) to a logistic function with
asymptotic plateau (a paradigm for growth in competition). We consider three
different scenarios, a base case, a high growth and an extreme growth scenario.
Using a discount factor of 5%, a profit margin of 29% and 3.5 USD of revenues
per user per year yields a value of facebook of 15.3 billion USD in the base
case scenario, 20.2 billion USD in the high growth scenario and 32.9 billion
USD in the extreme growth scenario. According to our methodology, this would
imply that facebook would need to increase its profit per user before the IPO
by a factor of 3 to 6 in the base case scenario, 2.5 to 5 in the high growth
scenario and 1.5 to 3 in the extreme growth scenario in order to meet the
current, widespread, high expectations. To prove the wider applicability of our
methodology, the analysis is repeated on Groupon, the well-known
deal-of-the-day website which is expected to go public in November 2011. The
results are in line with the facebook analysis. Customer growth will plateau.
By not taking this fundamental property of the growth process into

Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories (LCFTs), and exhibit in particular mixing
of the stress-energy tensor with a ""logarithmic"" partner under a conformal
transformation. This mixing is quantified by a parameter (usually denoted b),
introduced in [V. Gurarie, Nucl. Phys. B 546, 765 (1999)], and which was first
thought to play the role of an ""effective"" central charge. The value of b has
been determined over the last few years for the boundary versions of these
models: $b_{\rm perco}=-5/8$ for percolation and $b_{\rm poly} = 5/6$ for
dilute polymers. Meanwhile, the existence and value of $b$ for the bulk theory
has remained an open problem. Using lattice regularization techniques we
provide here an ""experimental study"" of this question. We show that, while the
chiral stress tensor has indeed a single logarithmic partner in the chiral
sector of the theory, the value of b is not the expected one: instead, b=-5 for
both theories. We suggest a theoretical explanation of this result using
operator product expansions and Coulomb gas arguments, and discuss the physical
consequences on correlation functions. Our results imply that the relation

all-pairs similarity search problem asks us to find all pairs of objects with
similarity greater than a certain user-specified threshold. Locality-sensitive
hashing (LSH) based methods have become a very popular approach for this
problem. However, most such methods only use LSH for the first phase of
similarity search - i.e. efficient indexing for candidate generation. In this
paper, we present BayesLSH, a principled Bayesian algorithm for the subsequent
phase of similarity search - performing candidate pruning and similarity
estimation using LSH. A simpler variant, BayesLSH-Lite, which calculates
similarities exactly, is also presented. BayesLSH is able to quickly prune away
a large majority of the false positive candidate pairs, leading to significant
speedups over baseline approaches. For BayesLSH, we also provide probabilistic
guarantees on the quality of the output, both in terms of accuracy and recall.
Finally, the quality of BayesLSH's output can be easily tuned and does not
require any manual setting of the number of hashes to use for similarity
estimation, unlike standard approaches. For two state-of-the-art candidate
generation algorithms, AllPairs and LSH, BayesLSH enables significant speedups,
typically in the range 2x-20x for a wide variety of datasets.

measured by the OPERA experiment with $\delta v_\nu=(v_\nu-c_0)/c_0$, where
$c_0$ is the speed of light in vacuum, using a bimetric relativity model. The
geometry of the bimetric model has two metrics in spacetime. One metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$ possesses a null cone along which massless gravitons and photons
travel with the constant speed $c_0$, while the other `matter' metric ${\hat
g}_{\mu\nu}=g_{\mu\nu}+\beta\psi_\mu\psi_\nu$ has a null cone with a bigger
speed $c > c_0$ with $0 < \delta v_\nu\ll c/c_0$. This second cone structure of
spacetime prevents the neutrinos from being superluminal tachyons $v_\nu < c$.
Such superluminal neutrinos would lead to severe depletion of neutrino energy,
refuting the OPERA result. The charge-current source of the background gauge
field $\psi_\mu$ is assumed to be baryon charge and the strength of the field
$\psi_\mu$ is distance dependent, explaining the observation that for supernova
SN1987a $v_\nu\simeq c_0$. Altering the path of the neutrinos through the earth

find that our simple model reproduces well the observed cloud distribution and

the performance of any heuristic method used to solve this problem. We also
derive from this dual optimal solution a primal-feasible dual-based method to
solve the problem and we compare its performance and computation time against a
standard weight adjustment method. We find that our method follows the dual
optimal bound more closely than the weight adjustment method. This off-line
algorithm can serve as the basis to develop more efficient heuristic methods.

  (SODA) 2012",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The densest k-subgraph (DkS) problem (i.e. find a size k subgraph with
maximum number of edges), is one of the notorious problems in approximation
algorithms. There is a significant gap between known upper and lower bounds for
DkS: the current best algorithm gives an ~ O(n^{1/4}) approximation, while even
showing a small constant factor hardness requires significantly stronger
assumptions than P != NP. In addition to interest in designing better
algorithms, a number of recent results have exploited the conjectured hardness
of densest k-subgraph and its variants. Thus, understanding the approximability
of DkS is an important challenge.
  In this work, we give evidence for the hardness of approximating DkS within
polynomial factors. Specifically, we expose the limitations of strong
semidefinite programs from SDP hierarchies in solving densest k-subgraph. Our
results include:
  * A lower bound of Omega(n^{1/4}/log^3 n) on the integrality gap for
Omega(log n/log log n) rounds of the Sherali-Adams relaxation for DkS. This
also holds for the relaxation obtained from Sherali-Adams with an added SDP
constraint. Our gap instances are in fact Erdos-Renyi random graphs.
  * For every epsilon > 0, a lower bound of n^{2/53-eps} on the integrality gap
of n^{Omega(eps)} rounds of the Lasserre SDP relaxation for DkS, and an
n^{Omega_eps(1)} gap for n^{1-eps} rounds. Our construction proceeds via a
reduction from random instances of a certain Max-CSP over large domains.
  In the absence of inapproximability results for DkS, our results show that
even the most powerful SDPs are unable to beat a factor of n^{Omega(1)}, and in
fact even improving the best known n^{1/4} factor is a barrier for current
techniques.

representation of the Poincare group that is also consistent with cluster
properties and a spectral condition. All three of these requirements constrain
the structure of the interactions. These conditions can be satisfied in
light-front quantum mechanics, maintaining the advantage of having a kinematic
subgroup of boosts and translations tangent to a light front. The most
straightforward construction of dynamical unitary representations of the
Poincare group due to Bakamjian and Thomas fails to satisfy the cluster
condition for more than two particles. Cluster properties can be restored, at
significant computational expense, using a recursive method due to Sokolov. In

di-lepton channel at both the Tevatron and Large Hadron Collider is presented.
Backgrounds from W photon production with external conversion of the on-shell
photon in detector material to an asymmetric electron-positron pair, with loss
of the trailing electron or positron has been treated adequately in Higgs
searches. Here we consider analogous backgrounds from the production of a W
with an off-shell photon and with the internal conversion of the off-shell
photon in vacuum to an asymmetric lepton-anti-lepton pair. While the former
process yields almost entirely electrons or positrons, the latter can give
electron, positron, muon, and anti-muon backgrounds in roughly equal amounts.
We estimate that asymmetric internal conversion backgrounds are comparable to
the Higgs boson signal in the standard signal region of phase space. These
processes also represent potential backgrounds for new physics searches in
same-sign di-lepton channels. Some data driven methods to characterize
asymmetric internal conversion backgrounds are suggested.

contributions to the general shape and show quantitatively which templates
provide a good approximation. We compute how relative contributions of basic
shapes to the total bispectrum scale as slow roll is relaxed. To enable future
comparison with CMB observations, we provide a modal expansion of these
non-separable bispectra in Fourier space, employing the formalism by Shellard
et al. Convergence is rapid, usually better than ninety-five percent with less
than thirty modes, due to the smoothness of these primordial shapes.
  Truncated polynomial modal expansions have restrictions, which we highlight
using an example with slow convergence. The particular shape originates from
particle production during inflation (common in trapped inflation) and entails
both localized and oscillatory features. We show that this shape can be
recovered efficiently using a Fourier basis and outline the prospect of future
model parameter extraction and N-body simulations based on modal techniques.

finite particle lifetimes, and discuss its impact on the transport properties

small frequency separation between modes of l=0 and l=2 (\delta \nu_02), and
the dimensionless offset (\epsilon). These measurements allow us to construct
asteroseismic diagrams, namely the so-called C-D diagram of \delta \nu_02

We determine the lower limit on the number of GCs to be 6450+-110 and show that

the question of whether NGC 4365 has a bimodal or trimodal GC colour

blue, green and red). Sersic profile fits to the radial surface density of each
subpopulation reveal that the blue GCs are more extended than either red or
green GCs. We find significant differences in the median half light radii for
GCs in the blue, green and red subpopulations as well as in the subpopulation
ellipticities. A KS test on the mass functions show >98 per cent probability
that all three subpopulations are distinct from one another. We also find
radial gradients of GC size and colour (metallicity) and a blue tilt. The
properties, including surface density profile, position angle, ellipticity and
radial colour gradient, of the red GC subpopulation are very similar to the
properties of NGC 4365's starlight. This result supports the hypothesis that
red GCs are formed along with the bulk of the diffuse starlight in the galaxy.
NGC 4365 has a kinematically distinct core and a significant misalignment
between the photometric and kinematic major axes. We discuss the possibility
that these kinematic features are related to the presence of the distinct third
GC subpopulation. We briefly discuss implications for the formation of NGC
4365. (Condensed from original.)

Solving these non-linear equations has been a great challenge in cosmology. Our
code is based on the RAMSES code, which solves the Poisson equation on
adaptively refined meshes to gain high resolutions in the high-density regions.
We have added a solver for the extra degree(s) of freedom and performed
numerous tests for the f(R) gravity model as an example to show its
reliability. We find that much higher efficiency could be achieved compared
with other existing mesh/grid-based codes thanks to two new features of the
present code: (1) the efficient parallelisation and (2) the usage of the
multigrid relaxation to solve the extra equation(s) on both the regular domain
grid and refinements, giving much faster convergence even under much more
stringent convergence criteria. This code is designed for performing
high-accuracy, high-resolution and large-volume cosmological simulations for
modified gravity and general dark energy theories, which can be utilised to
test gravity and the dark energy hypothesis using the upcoming and future deep

with direct imaging, with four giant planets orbiting at large separations from
this young late A star. Orbital motion provides insight into the stability, and
possible formation mechanisms of this planetary system. Dynamical studies can
also provide constraints on the planets' masses, which help calibrate
evolutionary models. Yet, measuring the orbital motion is a very difficult task
because the long-period orbits (50-500 yr) require long time baselines and
high-precision astrometry. This paper studies the three planets HR 8799b, c and
d in the archival data set of HR 8799 obtained with the HST NICMOS coronagraph
in 1998. The detection of all three planets is made possible by a careful
optimization of the LOCI algorithm. This work confirms previous astrometry for
planet b, and presents new detections and astrometry for c and d. These HST
images provide a ten-year baseline with the discovery images from 2008, and
therefore offer a unique opportunity to constrain their orbital motion now.
Recent dynamical studies of this system show the existence of a few possible
stable solutions involving mean motion resonances, where the interaction
between c and d plays a major role. We study the compatibility of a few of
these stable scenarios (1d:1c, 1d:2c, or 1d:2c:4d) with the new astrometric
data from HST. In the hypothesis of a 1d:2c:4b mean motion resonance our best
orbit fit is close to the stable solution previously identified for a
three-planet system, and involves low eccentricity for planet d (ed = 0.10) and
moderate inclination of the system (i = 28.0 deg), assuming a coplanar system,
circular orbits for b and c, and exact resonance with integer period ratios.
Under these assumptions, we can place strong constraints on the inclination of
the system (27.3 - 31.4 deg) and on the eccentricity for d ed < 0.46.

as structures satisfying axioms for the number type being considered, can be
scaled by arbitrary, positive real numbers. Local availability leads to the
assignment of mathematical universes, $V_{x},$ to each point, $x,$ of space
time. $V_{x}$ contains all the mathematics that an observer, $O_{x},$ at $x,$
can know. Each $V_{x}$ contains many types of mathematical systems. These
include the different types of numbers (natural numbers, integers, rationals,
and real and complex numbers), Hilbert spaces, algebras, and many other types
of systems. Space time dependent scaling of number systems is used to define
representations, in $V_{x}$, of real and complex number systems in $V_{y}$. The
representations are scaled by a factor $r_{y,x}$ relative to the systems in
$V_{x}.$ For $y$ a neighbor point of $x,$ $r_{y,x}$ is the exponential of the
scalar product of a gauge field, $\vec{A}(x),$ and the vector from $x$ to $y.$
For $y$ distant from $x,$ $r_{y,x}$ is a path integral from $x$ to $y.$ Some
consequences of the two premises will be examined. Number scaling has no effect
on general comparisons of numbers obtained as computations or as experimental
outputs. The effect is limited to mathematical expressions that include space
or space time integrals or derivatives. The effect of $\vec{A}$ on wave packets

gauge theories, is described.

observational values. Globular cluster planetary nebulae JaFu 1 and JaFu 2 are
reproduced {\it by assuming progenitor stars} with masses near the typical main
sequence turn-offs of globular clusters and with enhanced helium abundances
very similar to the enhancements inferred from fitting isochrones to globular
cluster colour-magnitude diagrams. The globular cluster PN GJJC-1 can be
roughly fit by a progenitor star with very extreme helium enhancement

as inferred by observations and a very low nebular mass. The abundances and
core mass of planetary nebula Ps 1 and its central star (K648) are reproduced

the Dirac crossing in graphene. The single bare Dirac crossing is split into
two individual Dirac-like points, which are separated in energy but still at
zero momentum relative to the K-point. A diamond-like structure occurs in
between as a result of the formation of plasmarons. In this work we explore the
combined effect of electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling on the
renormalized energy dispersion, the spectral function and on the electronic
density of states. We find that distinct signatures of the plasmaron structure
are observable in the density of states with the split Dirac points presenting
themselves as minima with quadratic dependence on energy about such points. By
examining the slopes of both the density of states and the renormalized
dispersion near the Fermi level, we illustrate how one can separate
$k$-dependent and $\omega$-dependent renormalizations and suggest how this
might allow for the isolation of the renormalization due to the electron-phonon
interaction from that of the electron-electron interaction.

quiet Sun at high spatial 0"".3 and temporal (33 s) resolution. The observations
were acquired by the IMaX imaging magnetograph during the first science flight
of the Sunrise balloon-borne solar observatory. The bipole flux content is 6 x
10^17 Mx, representing a structure bridging the gap between granular scale
bipoles and the smaller ephemeral regions. Footpoints separate at a speed of
3.5 km s-1 and reach a maximum distance of 4.5 Mm before the field dissolves.
The evolution of the bipole is revealed to be very dynamic: we found a proper
motion of the bipole axis and detected a change of the azimuth angle of
90{\deg} in 300 seconds. The overall morphology and behaviour are in agreement
with previous analyses of bipolar structures emerging at granular scale, but we
also found several similarities with emerging flux structures at larger scale.
The flux growth rate is 2.6 x 15 Mx s-1, while the mean decay rate is one order
of magnitude smaller. We describe in some detail the decay phase of the bipole
footpoints which includes break up into smaller structures, interaction with
pre-existing fields leading to cancellation but appears to be dominated by an
as-yet unidentified diffusive process that removes most of the flux with an
exponential flux decay curve. The diffusion constant (8 x 10^2 km^2 s-1)
associated with this decay is similar to the values used to describe the large
scale diffusion in flux transport models.

because of its linguistic and religious diversity that in other parts of the

maintained. Our analysis shows that peace does not depend on integrated
coexistence, but rather on well defined topographical and political boundaries
separating groups. Mountains and lakes are an important part of the boundaries
between sharply defined linguistic areas. Political canton and circle
(sub-canton) boundaries often separate religious groups. Where such boundaries
do not appear to be sufficient, we find that specific aspects of the population
distribution either guarantee sufficient separation or sufficient mixing to
inhibit intergroup violence according to the quantitative theory of conflict.
In exactly one region, a porous mountain range does not adequately separate
linguistic groups and violent conflict has led to the recent creation of the
canton of Jura. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that violence between
groups can be inhibited by physical and political boundaries. A similar
analysis of the area of the former Yugoslavia shows that during widespread
ethnic violence existing political boundaries did not coincide with the
boundaries of distinct groups, but peace prevailed in specific areas where they
did coincide. The success of peace in Switzerland may serve as a model to
resolve conflict in other ethnically diverse countries and regions of the

conditions are modeled by self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice
($d=3$ dimensions) and square lattice ($d=2$ dimensions), varying chain
stiffness by an energy penalty $\epsilon_b$ for chain bending. In the absence
of excluded volume interactions, the persistence length $\ell_p$ of the
polymers would then simply be $\ell_p=\ell_b(2d-2)^{-1}q_b^{-1}$ with $q_b=
\exp(-\epsilon_b/k_BT)$, the bond length $\ell_b$ being the lattice spacing,
and $k_BT$ is the thermal energy. Using Monte Carlo simulations applying the
pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), both $q_b$ and the chain length $N$
are varied over a wide range $(0.005 \leq q_b \leq 1, \; N \leq 50000$), and
also a stretching force $f$ is applied to one chain end (fixing the other end
at the origin). In the absence of this force, in $d=2$ a single crossover from
rod-like behavior (for contour lengths less than $\ell_p$) to swollen coils
occurs, invalidating the Kratky-Porod model, while in $d=3$ a double crossover
occurs, from rods to Gaussian coils (as implied by the Kratky-Porod model) and
then to coils that are swollen due to the excluded volume interaction. If the
stretching force is applied, excluded volume interactions matter for the force
versus extension relation irrespective of chain stiffness in $d=2$, while
theories based on the Kratky-Porod model are found to work in $d=3$ for stiff
chains in an intermediate regime of chain extensions. While for $q_b \ll 1$ in
this model a persistence length can be estimated from the initial decay of
bond-orientational correlations, it is argued that this is not possible for
more complex wormlike chains (e.g. bottle-brush polymers). Consequences for the
proper interpretation of experiments are briefly discussed.

other classifications based on intrinsic properties. Class 0/I and II
candidates were also compared to low/intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars
selected through their colors and magnitudes in 2MASS. We find that a reliable
color/magnitude selection of low-mass PMS stars in the infrared requires prior
knowledge of the protostar population, while intermediate mass objects can be
more reliably identified. By means of the MST algorithm and our YSO spatial
distribution and age maps we investigated the YSO groups and the star formation
history in W3. We find signatures of clustered and distributed star formation
in both triggered and quiescent environments. The central/western parts of the
GMC are dominated by large scale turbulence likely powered by isolated bursts
of star formation that triggered secondary star formation events. Star
formation in the eastern high density layer also shows signs of extended
periods of star formation. While our findings support triggering as a key
factor for inducing and enhancing some of the major star forming activity in
the HDL (e.g., W3 Main/W3(OH)), we argue that some degree of quiescent or
spontaneous star formation is required to explain the observed YSO population.
Our results also support previous studies claiming an spontaneous origin for
the isolated massive star(s) powering KR 140.

mountain streams or capillaries) to the ""root"" of the network (e.g., the river

networks with loops because they they create a contradiction in the edge
ordering in terms of which edge precedes another in the hierarchy. Here, we
present a generalization of the Horton-Strahler order to weighted planar
reticular networks, where weights are assumed to correlate with the importance
of network edges, e.g., weights estimated from edge widths may correlate to
flow capacity. Our method assigns hierarchical levels not only to edges of the
network, but also to its loops, and classifies the edges into reticular edges,
which are responsible for loop formation, and tree edges. In addition, we
perform a detailed and rigorous theoretical analysis of the sensitivity of the
hierarchical levels to weight perturbations. We discuss applications of this

antisymmetric tensor field $\phi_{\mu\nu}^a$ possessing a pseudoscalar mass, it
has been shown that all physical degrees of freedom reside in the vector field.
Upon quantizing this model using the Faddeev-Popov procedure, explicit
calculation of the two-point functions $<\phi\phi >$ and $<W \phi>$ at one-loop
order seems to have yielded the puzzling result that the effective action
generated by radiative effects has more physical degrees of freedom than the
original classical action. In this paper we point out that this is not in fact
a real effect, but rather appears to be a consequence of having ignored a
""ghost"" field arising from the contribution to the measure in the path integral
arising from the presence of non-trivial second-class constraints. These ghost
fields couple to the fields $W_\mu^a$ and $\phi_{\mu\nu}^a$, which makes them
distinct from other models involving ghosts arising from second-class
constraints (such as massive Yang-Mills (YM) models) that have been considered,
as in these other models such ghosts decouple. As an alternative to dealing
with second class constraints, we consider introducing a ""Stueckelberg field""
to eliminate second-class constraints in favour of first-class constraints and
examine if it is possible to then use the Faddeev-Popov quantization procedure.
In the Proca model, introduction of the Stueckelberg vector is equivalent to
the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) approach to converting second-class
constraints to being first class through the introduction of new variables.
However, introduction of a Stueckelberg vector is not equivalent to the BFT
approach for the vector-tensor model. In an appendix, the BFT procedure is
applied to the pure tensor model and a novel gauge invariance is found.

observations with 1.2 m telescope, we monitored the source during the 2011
February--March giant outburst to primarily investigate whether any drastic
changes in the near-IR JHK spectra take place at the periastron passage.
Changes of such a striking nature were expected to be detectable in our

fading in the JHK light curves since the onset of the X-ray outburst that could
suggest a mild evacuation/truncation of the circumstellar disc of the Be

dominated by the emission lines of hydrogen Brackett and Paschen series and HeI

emission lines in the JHK spectra, along with the absence of any significant
change in the continuum of the Be companion during X-ray quiescent and X-ray

substances is critical to homeland security. It is challenging to identify
chemical components from a wide range of explosives. There are two key steps
involved. One is a nondestructive and informative spectroscopic technique for
data acquisition. The other is an associated library of reference features
along with a computational method for feature matching and meaningful detection
within or beyond the library.
  Recently several experimental techniques based on Raman scattering have been
developed to perform standoff detection and identification of explosives, and
they prove to be successful under certain idealized conditions. However data
analysis is limited to standard least squares method assuming the complete
knowledge of the chemical components. In this paper, we develop a new iterative
method to identify unknown substances from mixture samples of Raman
spectroscopy. In the first step, a constrained least squares method decomposes
the data into a sum of linear combination of the known components and a
non-negative residual. In the second step, a sparse and convex blind source
separation method extracts components geometrically from the residuals.
Verification based on the library templates or expert knowledge helps to
confirm these components. If necessary, the confirmed meaningful components are
fed back into step one to refine the residual and then step two extracts
possibly more hidden components. The two steps may be iterated until no more
components can be identified.
  We illustrate the proposed method in processing a set of the so called swept
wavelength optical resonant Raman spectroscopy experimental data by a
satisfactory blind extraction of a priori unknown chemical explosives from
mixture samples.

influence of superdiffusion on optical interference effects like weak and
strong localization. Super diffusive structures have the extraordinary property
that all points are connected via direct jumps, meaning that finite-size

Interstellar Medium. It builds upon the fact that, in the presence of far UV
radiation and hydrocarbon grains, the hydrogen gas will be partially
dissociated and the grain surface will be partially hydrogenated and partially
covered with free carbon bonds. Under such a statistical equilibrium, H atoms
from the gas will recombine with C atoms at the grain surface at some rate. At
each recombination, the H atom deposits an energy of about 5 eV in the grain.
Half of this is directly converted into vibrational excitation, always
distributed in the same way among the most tightly coupled vibration modes of
the grain. Absent frequent grain-grain collisions, the only outlet for this
energy is IR reemission, part of it in the UIBs, provided the chemical
structure of the grains is adequate, and the other part in the continuum. The
partition only depends upon the grain size, all grains being assumed to have
the same constitution. Only a fraction, about 0.25, of the grains (among the
smallest ones) will contribute significantly to the UIBs.
  It is shown quantitatively that H impacts are generally more efficient
excitation agents than UV absorption because of the overwhelming abundance of
hydrogen relative to UV photons. Only very close to young bright stars is this
no longer true because photon flux then largely exceeds H atom flux. Thus H
impacts and FUV absorption are both necessary to understand the variety of
observed UIB spectra.
  The model translates into a small number of equations enabling a quantitative
comparison of its predictions with available astronomical observations, which
have become exquisitely rich and accurate in the last two decades.

histogram data using a dynamic clustering algorithm. Histogram data describes
individuals in terms of empirical distributions. These kind of data can be
considered as complex descriptions of phenomena observed on complex objects:
images, groups of individuals, spatial or temporal variant data, results of
queries, environmental data, and so on. The Wasserstein distance is used to
compare two histograms. The Wasserstein distance between histograms is
constituted by two components: the first based on the means, and the second, to
internal dispersions (standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and so on) of the
histograms. To cluster sets of histogram data, we propose to use Dynamic
Clustering Algorithm, (based on adaptive squared Wasserstein distances) that is
a k-means-like algorithm for clustering a set of individuals into $K$ classes
that are apriori fixed.
  The main aim of this research is to provide a tool for clustering histograms,
emphasizing the different contributions of the histogram variables, and their
components, to the definition of the clusters. We demonstrate that this can be
achieved using adaptive distances. Two kind of adaptive distances are
considered: the first takes into account the variability of each component of
each descriptor for the whole set of individuals; the second takes into account
the variability of each component of each descriptor in each cluster. We
furnish interpretative tools of the obtained partition based on an extension of
the classical measures (indexes) to the use of adaptive distances in the
clustering criterion function. Applications on synthetic and real-world data
corroborate the proposed procedure.

$\pi_n$. However, for topological excitations that coexist with vortices, there
are case in which an element of $\pi_n$ cannot properly describe the charge of
a topological excitation due to the influence of the vortices. This is because
an element of $\pi_n$ corresponding to the charge of a topological excitation
may change when the topological excitation circumnavigates a vortex. This
phenomenon is referred to as the action of $\pi_1$ on $\pi_n$. In this paper,
we show that topological excitations coexisting with vortices are classified by
the Abe homotopy group $\kappa_n$. The $n$th Abe homotopy group $\kappa_n$ is
defined as a semi-direct product of $\pi_1$ and $\pi_n$. In this framework, the
action of $\pi_1$ on $\pi_n$ is understood as originating from noncommutativity
between $\pi_1$ and $\pi_n$. We show that a physical charge of a topological
excitation can be described in terms of the conjugacy class of the Abe homotopy
group. Moreover, the Abe homotopy group naturally describes vortex-pair
creation and annihilation processes, which also influence topological
excitations. We calculate the influence of vortices on topological excitations
for the case in which the order parameter manifold is $S^n/K$, where $S^n$ is
an $n$-dimensional sphere and $K$ is a discrete subgroup of $SO(n+1)$. We show
that the influence of vortices on a topological excitation exists only if $n$
is even and $K$ includes a nontrivial element of $O(n)/SO(n)$.

image. For the purpose of feature extraction, instead of considering the entire
face image, an entropy-based local band selection criterion is developed, which
selects high-informative horizontal segments from the face image. In order to
capture the local spatial variations within these highinformative horizontal
bands precisely, the horizontal band is segmented into several small spatial
modules. Dominant wavelet coefficients corresponding to each local region
residing inside those horizontal bands are selected as features. In the
selection of the dominant coefficients, a threshold criterion is proposed,
which not only drastically reduces the feature dimension but also provides high
within-class compactness and high between-class separability. A principal
component analysis is performed to further reduce the dimensionality of the
feature space. Extensive experimentation is carried out upon standard face
databases and a very high degree of recognition accuracy is achieved by the
proposed method in comparison to those obtained by some of the existing
methods.

extend the sampled parameter space of the Mbh-Mhost relation in quasars. The
relation holds over 2 dex in both the parameters, similarly to what observed in
low-luminosity AGN and in quiescent galaxies. For the first time, we are able
to measure the slope of the Mbh-Mhost relation in quasars. We find that it is
consistent with the linear case (similarly to what observed in quiescent
galaxies). We do not find any evidence of a population of massive black holes
lying below the relation.

solitons of the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) equation is demonstrated.
Approximate solutions for solitons whose width is large in comparison to the
lattice spacing are derived, using a continuum counterpart of the discrete
equations. These solitons are mobile, featuring nearly elastic collisions.
Stationary solutions for narrow solitons, which are immobile due to the pinning

coherent oscillations exhibiting non-exponential decay, indicating a non
trivial decoherence mechanism. Moreover, by tuning the qubit in different
conditions (different oscillation frequencies) by changing the pulse height, we
observe a crossover between two distinct decoherence regimes and the existence
of an ""optimal"" point where the qubit is only weakly sensitive to intrinsic
noise. We find that this behaviour is in agreement with a model considering the
decoherence caused essentially by low frequency noise contributions, and
discuss the experimental results and possible issues.

biology and chemical engineering to model chemical reaction networks. Numerous
techniques have been developed to estimate parameters like rate constants,
initial conditions or steady state concentrations from time-resolved data. In
contrast to this countable set of parameters, the estimation of entire courses
of network components corresponds to an innumerable set of parameters. The
approach presented in this work is able to deal with course estimation for
extrinsic system inputs or intrinsic reactants, both not being constrained by
the reaction network itself. Our method is based on variational calculus which
is carried out analytically to derive an augmented system of differential
equations including the unconstrained components as ordinary state variables.
Finally, conventional parameter estimation is applied to the augmented system
resulting in a combined estimation of courses and parameters. The combined
estimation approach takes the uncertainty in input courses correctly into
account. This leads to precise parameter estimates and correct confidence
intervals. In particular this implies that small motifs of large reaction
networks can be analysed independently of the rest. By the use of variational
methods, elements from control theory and statistics are combined allowing for
future transfer of methods between the two fields.

Gamma-ray signatures from the decay or annihilation of dark matter particles

coming from eight nearby clusters individually as well as in a combined
likelihood analysis. Concentrating mostly on signals from dark matter decay, we
take into account uncertainties of the cluster masses as determined by X-ray
observations and model the cluster emission as extended sources. Searching for
different hadronic and leptonic decay and annihilation spectra, we do not find
significant emission from any of the considered clusters and present limits on
the dark matter lifetime and annihilation cross-section. We compare our
lifetime limits derived from cluster observations with the limits that can be
obtained from the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGBG), and find that in
case of hadronic decay the cluster limits become competitive at dark matter
masses below a few hundred GeV. In case of leptonic decay, however, galaxy
cluster limits are stronger than the limits from the EGBG over the full
considered mass range. Finally, we show that in presence of dark matter
substructures down to 10^-6 solar masses the limits on the dark matter
annihilation cross-section could improve by a factor of a few hundred, possibly
going down to the thermal cross-section of 3 10^-26 cm^3 s^-1 for dark matter
masses < 150 GeV and annihilation into $b\bar{b}$. As a direct application of
our results, we derive limits on the lifetime of gravitino dark matter in

C*-algebra associated to a metric space. We study the relationship between this
maximal Roe algebra and the usual version, in both the uniform and non-uniform
cases. The main result is that if a (uniformly discrete, bounded geometry)
metric space X coarsely embeds in a Hilbert space, then the canonical map
between the maximal and usual (uniform) Roe algebras induces an isomorphism on
K-theory. We also give a simple proof that if X has property A, then the

natural coarse-geometric analogues of certain well-known implications of

a metric space (X,d). In the special case that X=G is a finitely generated
group and d is a word metric, the simplest Roe algebra associated to (G,d) is
isomorphic to the reduced crossed product C*-algebra l^\infty(G)\rtimes G.
  Roe algebras are 'coarse invariants', in the sense that if X and Y are
coarsely equivalent metric spaces, then their Roe algebras are isomorphic.
Motivated in part by the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture, we ask if there is a
converse to the above statement: that is, if X and Y are metric spaces with
isomorphic Roe algebras, must X and Y be coarsely equivalent? We show that for
very large classes of spaces the answer to this question, and some related
questions, is 'yes'. This can be thought of as a 'C*-rigidity result': it shows
that the Roe algebra construction preserves a large amount of information about
the space, and is thus surprisingly 'rigid'.
  As an example of our results, in the group case we have that if G and H are
finitely generated elementary amenable, hyperbolic, or linear, groups such that
the crossed products l^\infty(G)\rtimes G and l^\infty(H)\rtimes H are
isomorphic, then G and H are quasi-isometric.

binaries, different acceleration processes to estimate their efficiency: Fermi
I, Fermi II, shear acceleration, the converter mechanism, and magnetic
reconnection. We find that Fermi I acceleration in a mildly relativistic shock
can provide, although marginally, the multi-10 TeV particles required to
explain observations. Shear acceleration may be a complementary mechanism,
giving particles the final boost to reach such a high energies. Fermi II
acceleration may be too slow to account for the observed very high energy
photons, but may be suitable to explain extended low-energy emission. The
converter mechanism seems to require rather high Lorentz factors but cannot be
discarded a priori. Standard relativistic shock acceleration requires a highly
turbulent, weakly magnetized downstream medium; magnetic reconnection, by
itself possibly insufficient to reach very high energies, could perhaps
facilitate such a conditions. Further theoretical developments, and a better
source characterization, are needed to pinpoint the dominant acceleration
mechanism, which need not be one and the same in all sources.

the subject of recent research interest. First, the role of `double parton
splitting' diagrams in DPS is discussed. We outline the `double PDF'
description of DPS, which was introduced a number of years ago. It is pointed
out that under this framework, a certain structure is anticipated in the cross
section expression for a `double perturbative splitting' diagram, which in the
framework is regarded as DPS. We show that although this structure does indeed
appear in the `double perturbative splitting' diagrams, there is no natural
reason to demarcate specifically this part of the graph as the DPS part, and
indeed there is no natural part of these diagrams that can be regarded as DPS.
There therefore appear to be some unsatisfactory features in the double PDF
approach to describing DPS. The second issue we discuss is that of interference
and correlated parton contributions to proton-proton DPS. We explain in simple
terms why there can be such contributions to the DPS cross section. The
potential existence of such contributions was pointed out long ago by Mekhfi
and more recently by Diehl and Schafer, but has been largely ignored in
phenomenological investigations of DPS.

A functional integral for quantum gravity is regularized on a discrete set of
space-time points, with fermionic or bosonic lattice fields. When the
space-time points are positioned as discrete points of a continuous manifold,
the lattice action can be reformulated in terms of average fields within local
cells and lattice derivatives. Lattice diffeomorphism invariance is realized if
the action is independent of the positioning of the space-time points. Regular
as well as rather irregular lattices are then described by the same action.
Lattice diffeomorphism invariance implies that the continuum limit and the
quantum effective action are invariant under general coordinate transformations
- the basic ingredient for general relativity. In our approach the lattice
diffeomorphism invariant actions are formulated without introducing a metric or
other geometrical objects as fundamental degrees of freedom. The metric rather
arises as the expectation value of a suitable collective field. As examples, we
present lattice diffeomorphism invariant actions for a bosonic non-linear
sigma-model and lattice spinor gravity.

measurements with unprecedented accuracy; the end-of-mission parallax standard
error is required to be 30 micro-arcseconds for a G2V type star of magnitude
15. These requirements set a stringent constraint on the accuracy of the
estimation of the location of the stellar image on the CCD for each
observation: e.g., 0.3 milli-arseconds (mas) or 0.005 pixels for the same V=15
G2V star. However the Gaia CCDs will suffer from charge transfer inefficiency
(CTI) caused by radiation damage that will degrade the stellar image quality
and may degrade the astrometric performance of Gaia if not properly addressed.
For the first time at this level of detail, the potential impact of radiation
damage on the performance of Gaia is investigated. In this first paper we focus
on the evaluation of the CTI impact on the image location accuracy. We show
that CTI decreases the stellar image signal-to-noise ratio and irreversibly
degrades the image location estimation precision. As a consequence the location
estimation standard errors increase by up to 6% for a radiation damage level
equivalent to the end-of-mission. In addition the CTI-induced image distortion
introduces a systematic bias in the image location estimation (up to 0.05
pixels or 3 mas in the Gaia operating conditions). We present a novel approach
to CTI mitigation that enables, without correction of the raw data, the
unbiased estimation of the image location and flux from damaged observations.
Its implementation reduces the maximum measured location bias for the faintest
magnitude to 0.005 pixels (~4e-4 pixels at magnitude 15). In a second paper we
will investigate how the CTI effects affect the final astrometric accuracy of
Gaia by propagating residual errors through the astrometric solution.

temperature limit in laser sideband cooling experiments with trapped ions. It
is emphasized that similar heating processes might be present in a variety of
composite quantum systems whose components couple individually to different
environments. For example, quantum optical heating effects might contribute
significantly to the very high temperatures which occur during the collapse
phase in sonoluminescence experiments. It might even be possible to design
composite quantum systems, like atom-cavity systems, such that they
continuously emit photons even in the absence of external driving.

minimizing the number of colors used. We compare the number of colors provided
by VCM with the number of colors obtained by a distributed coloring algorithm

The analytical approach allows explicit estimates of dominant generation and

the cells. Consistency of the analysis of cell characteristics in the light and
in the dark leaves a single free parameter, which is the mean
Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime. Bulk PIN cells are shown to be inherently
dominated by non-radiative recombination as a result of the doping related
non-radiative fraction of the Shockley injection currents. Quantum well PIN
solar cells on the other hand are shown to operate in the radiative limit as a
result of the dominance of radiative recombination in the space charge region.
These features are exploited using light trapping techniques leading to photon
recycling and reduced radiative recombination. The conclusion is that the
mirror backed quantum well solar cell device features open circuit voltages
determined mainly by the higher bandgap neutral layers, with an absorption
threshold determined by the lower gap quantum well superlattice.

interactions with clouds, radiation, ecosystems, and other components of the
Earth system. Several theoretical models predict that the dust size
distribution depends on the wind speed at emission, with larger wind speeds
predicted to produce smaller aerosols. The present study investigates this
prediction using a compilation of published measurements of the size-resolved
vertical dust flux emitted by eroding soils. Surprisingly, these measurements
indicate that the size distribution of naturally emitted dust aerosols is
independent of the wind speed. The recently formulated brittle fragmentation
theory of dust emission is consistent with this finding, whereas other
theoretical dust emission models are not. The independence of the emitted dust
size distribution with wind speed simplifies both the interpretation of
geological records of dust deposition and the parameterization of dust emission
in atmospheric circulation models.

keep track of the location of other nodes using a new proposed cell-based
