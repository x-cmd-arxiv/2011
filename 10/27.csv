a function of water vapor supersaturation over the temperature range $-2$ $\geq

on the basal surface and the effects of premelting on the ice growth dynamics.
Over this entire temperature range the growth was consistent with a simple 2D
nucleation model, allowing a measurement of the critical supersaturation
$\sigma _{0}(T)$ as a function of temperature. We find that the 2D nucleation
barrier is substantially diminished when the premelted layer is partially
developed, as indicated by a reduced $\sigma _{0},$ while the barrier is higher

exoplanet search with the transit technique by preselecting a subset of
candidates from large catalogs of stars. Assuming spin-orbit alignment, this
can be done by considering stars that have higher probability to be oriented
nearly equator-on (inclination close to 90^{\circ}).
  Methods. We use activity-rotation velocity relations for low-mass stars with
a convective envelope to study the dependence of the position in the
activity-vsini diagram on the stellar axis inclination. We compose a catalog of
G-, K-, M-type main sequence simulated stars using isochrones, an isotropic
inclination distribution and empirical relations to obtain their rotation
periods and activity indexes. Then the activity - vsini diagram is filled and
statistics are applied to trace the areas containing the higher ratio of stars
with inclinations above 80^{\circ}. A similar statistics is applied to stars
from real catalogs with log(R'HK) and vsini data to find their probability of
being equator-on.
  Results. We present the method used to generate the simulated star catalog
and the subsequent statistics to find the highly inclined stars from real
catalogs using the activity - vsini diagram. Several catalogs from the
literature are analysed and a subsample of stars with the highest probability
of being equator-on is presented.
  Conclusions. Assuming spin-orbit alignment, the efficiency of an exoplanet
transit search in the resulting subsample of probably highly inclined stars is
estimated to be two to three times higher than with a global search with no
preselection.

Cox to a class of ""two-factor"" models that unify equity securities such as
options written on the stock price, and credit products like bonds and credit
default swaps. In our approach, the two sides of the stylized balance sheet of
a firm, namely the asset value and debt value, are assumed to follow a two
dimensional Markov process. Amongst models of this type we find examples that
lead to derivative pricing formulas that are capable of reproducing the main
features of well known equity models such as the variance gamma model, and at
the same time reproducing the stylized facts about default stemming from
structural models of credit risk. Moreover, in contrast to one-factor
structural models, these models allow for much more flexible dependence between
equity and credit markets. Two main technical obstacles to efficient
implementation of these pricing formulas are overcome in our paper. The first
obstacle stems from the barrier condition implied by the non-default of the
firm, and is overcome by the idea of time-changing Brownian motion in a way
that preserves the reflection principle for Brownian motion. The second
obstacle is the difficulty of computing spread options: this is overcome by
using results in recent papers that make efficient use of the two dimensional

is derived from the simultaneous reconstruction of two different CMDs, using

is varied within intervals 0.2 and 0.5 mag wide, respectively, within which we
identify the best-fitting star formation rate SFR(t), age-metallicity relation

combination of depth and little sensitivity to differential reddening, allow
the derivation of the space-resolved SFH of the LMC with unprecedented quality

the presence of peaks in the SFR(t) at ages log(t/yr)=9.3 and 9.7, which appear

subregion to subregion, with the general trend of being more intense in the
innermost LMC, except for the tile next to the N11 complex. In the bar region,
the SFR seems remarkably constant over the time interval from 8.4 to 9.7. The

the striking influence of many-body physics on few-body properties. In the
quantum-mechanical three-body problem the famous Efimov effect yields
unexpected scaling relations among a tower of universal states. These seemingly
unrelated problems can now be studied in the same setup thanks to the success
of ultracold atomic gas experiments. In light of the tremendous effect of a
background Fermi sea on two-body properties, a natural question is whether a

how the generic problem of three interacting particles changes when one

persists. It is found in a scaling that relates the three-body physics to the

(iv) intermittent quiescent phases devoid of star formation during which the

forming in situ and with low alpha-enhancement from gas which never
participated in a galactic outflow. Up to 15 per cent of disc stars can come
from accreted satellites. These tend to be alpha-enhanced, older and to have
larger velocity dispersions than the in situ population. Inner spheroids have
old, metal-rich and alpha-enhanced stars which formed primarily in situ, more
than 40 per cent from material recycled through earlier galactic winds. Few
accreted stars are found in the inner spheroid unless a major merger occurred
recently. Such stars are older, more metal-poor and more alpha-enhanced than
the in situ population. Stellar haloes tend to have low metallicity and high
alpha-enhancement. The outer haloes are made primarily of accreted stars. Their
mean metallicity and alpha-enhancement reflect the masses of the disrupted
satellites where they formed: more massive satellites typically have higher
[Fe/H] and lower [alpha/Fe]. Surviving satellites have distinctive chemical
patterns which reflect their extended, bursty star formation histories. These
produce lower alpha-enhancement at given metallicity than in the main galaxy,

setting with random modulation, considering a whole class of sensing bases
including the Fourier basis, we prove that the technique is universal in the
sense that the required number of measurements for accurate recovery is optimal
and independent of the sparsity basis. This universality stems from a drastic
decrease of coherence between the sparsity and the sensing bases, which for a
Fourier sensing basis relates to a spread of the original signal spectrum by
the modulation (hence the name ""spread spectrum""). The approach is also
efficient as sensing matrices with fast matrix multiplication algorithms can be
used, in particular in the case of Fourier measurements. Secondly, these
results are confirmed by a numerical analysis of the phase transition of the
l1- minimization problem. Finally, we show that the spread spectrum technique
remains effective in an analog setting with chirp modulation for application to
realistic Fourier imaging. We illustrate these findings in the context of radio

related class of conformal field theories with conformal charge c=1 and varying
exponents. The transition is first-order for g<g*= 0.67(1), much lower than
previously believed, and exhibits pseudo first-order behavior for g* < g < 1.

30 kpc. On smaller spatial scales, projection effects smear the density
fluctuations by a large factor, precluding strong limits on the fluctuations in
3D. On the largest scales probed (hundreds of kpc), the dominant contributions
to the observed fluctuations most likely arise from perturbations of the
gravitational potential by the two most massive galaxies in Coma, NGC4874 and
NGC4889, and the low entropy gas brought to the cluster by an infalling group.

including turbulence, metal abundance variations, and unresolved sources.

sight-lines with strong MgII absorption (with EW>0.3 \AA) is bi-modal: about
half the MgII sight-lines are aligned with the major axis and the other half

significantly to the MgII cross-section. This bi-modality is also present in
the instantaneous star-formation rates (SFRs) of the hosts. For the sight-lines
aligned along the minor axis, a simple bi-conical wind model is able to
reproduce the observed MgII kinematics and the MgII dependence with impact
parameter b, (EW $\propto b^{-1}$). Using our wind model, we can directly
extract key wind properties such as the de-projected outflow speed $V_{out}$ of
the cool material traced by MgII and the outflow rates. The outflow speeds are
found to be 150-300 \kms, i.e. of the order of the circular velocity, and
smaller than the escape velocity by a factor of ~2. The outflow rates are
typically two to three times the instantaneous SFRs. Our results demonstrates
how background quasars can be used to measure wind properties with high

neutral functions on $k \geq 4$ alternatives by Isaksson, Kindler and Mossel.
  We prove a quantitative version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for

particular we show that for a social choice function $f$ on $k \geq 3$
alternatives and $n$ voters, which is $\epsilon$-far from the family of
nonmanipulable functions, a uniformly chosen voter profile is manipulable with
probability at least inverse polynomial in $n$, $k$, and $\epsilon^{-1}$.
  Removing the neutrality assumption of previous theorems is important for
multiple reasons. For one, it is known that there is a conflict between
anonymity and neutrality, and since most common voting rules are anonymous,
they cannot always be neutral. Second, virtual elections are used in many
applications in artificial intelligence, where there are often restrictions on
the outcome of the election, and so neutrality is not a natural assumption in
these situations.
  Ours is a unified proof which in particular covers all previous cases
established before. The proof crucially uses reverse hypercontractivity in
addition to several ideas from the two previous proofs. Much of the work is
devoted to understanding functions of a single voter, and in particular we also
prove a quantitative Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for one voter.

bright nearby galaxies, NGC 185 was classified as a Seyfert galaxy based on its
emission line ratios. However, although the emission lines in this object
formally place it in the category of Seyferts, it is probable that this galaxy
does not contain a genuine active nucleus. NGC 185 was not detected in radio
surveys either in 6 or 20 cm, or X-ray observations, which means that the
Seyfert-like line ratios may be produced by stellar processes. In this work, we
try to identify the possible ionization mechanisms for this galaxy. We
discussed the possibility of the line emissions being produced by planetary
nebulae (PNe), using deep spectroscopy observations obtained with GMOS-N, at
Gemini. Although the fluxes of the PNe are high enough to explain the
integrated spectrum, the line ratios are very far from the values for the
Seyfert classification. We then proposed that a mixture of supernova remnants
and PNe could be the source of the ionization, and we show that a composition
of these two objects do mimic Seyfert-like line ratios. We used chemical

level of cooling is far from optimal; Exhaustive algorithms, on the other hand,
cool much better, and some even reach (asymptotically) an optimal level of
cooling, but they are not practicable. We introduce here semi-optimal
practicable AC (SOPAC), wherein few cycles (typically 2-6) are performed at
each recursive level. Two classes of SOPAC algorithms are proposed and
analyzed. Both attain cooling levels significantly better than PAC, and are
much more efficient than the exhaustive algorithms. The new algorithms are
shown to bridge the gap between PAC and exhaustive AC. In addition, we
calculated the number of spins required by SOPAC in order to purify qubits for
quantum computation. As few as 12 and 7 spins are required (in an ideal
scenario) to yield a mildly pure spin (60% polarized) from initial
polarizations of 1% and 10%, respectively. In the latter case, about five more

tilted octupole field components. We further argue that the longitudinal field
curve, whether derived from accretion related emission lines, or from
photospheric absorption lines, provides poor constrains on the large-scale

modulated Stokes V signal is required to recover the true field complexity. We
conclude by examining the advantages, disadvantages and limitations of both the

the continuous evolution of optical line emission in brightest cluster galaxies

evolution of emission line nebulae to the X-ray-derived cool core (CC) fraction
from the literature over the same redshift range and find overall agreement,

z > 0.3. The overall agreement between the evolution of cool cores and optical

strongly dependent on disc position. For example, we find that the kinematic
groups induced by the spiral arm models change significantly if one moves only
~ 0.6 kpc in galactocentric radius, but ~ 2 kpc in azimuth. There are more and
stronger groups as one approaches the spiral arms. Depending on the spiral
pattern speed, the kinematic imprints are more intense in nearby vicinities or
far from the Sun. Secondly, we present a preliminary study of the kinematic

discuss the possibility to send a neutrino beam from one of the major
accelerator laboratories in the Northern hemisphere to such a detector. Such an
experiment would be unique in the sense that it would be the only neutrino beam
where the baseline crosses the Earth's core. We study the detector requirements
for a beta beam, a neutrino factory beam, and a superbeam, where we consider
both the cases of small theta_13 and large theta_13, as suggested by the recent
T2K and Double Chooz results. We illustrate that a flavor-clean beta beam best
suits the requirements of such a detector, in particular, that PINGU may
replace a magic baseline detector for small values of theta_13 -- even in the
absence of any energy resolution capability. For large theta_13, however, a
single-baseline beta beam experiment cannot compete if it is constrained by the
CERN-SPS. For a neutrino factory, because of the missing charge identification
possibility in the detector, a very good energy resolution is required. If this
can be achieved, especially a low energy neutrino factory, which does not
suffer from the tau contamination, may be an interesting option for large
theta_13. For the superbeam, where we use the LBNE beam as a reference,
electron neutrino flavor identification and statistics are two of the main
limitations. Finally, we demonstrate that, at least in principle, neutrino
factory and superbeam can measure the density of the Earth's core to the

planetary system precesses like a rigid body about its parent star.
Consequently, the parent star's spin axis and the planetary orbit normal likely
diverged long ago. Because only the projected separation of the binary is
known, we study this effect statistically, assuming an isotropic distribution
for wide binary orbits. We find that the most likely projected spin-orbit angle
is ~50 degrees, with a ~30% chance of a retrograde configuration. Transit
observations of the innermost planet - 55 Cnc e - may be used to verify these
findings via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. 55 Cancri may thus represent a new

the nearby radio galaxy 3C326 N, which shows no signs of on-going or recent
star formation and falls a factor 60 below the Schmidt-Kennicutt law.
VLT/SINFONI imaging spectroscopy shows broad (FWHM \sim 500 km/s)
ro-vibrational H_2 lines across all of the disk, with irregular profiles and
line ratios consistent with shocks. The ratio of turbulent and gravitational
energy suggests that the gas is highly turbulent and not gravitationally bound.
In absence of the driving by the jet, short turbulent dissipation times suggest
the gas should collapse rapidly and form stars, at odds with the recent
star-formation history. Motivated by hydrodynamic models of rapid H_2 formation
boosted by turbulent compression, we propose that the molecules formed from
diffuse atomic gas in the turbulent jet cocoon. Since the gas is not
self-gravitating, it cannot form molecular clouds or stars while the jet is
active, and is likely to disperse and become atomic again after the nuclear
activity ceases. We speculate that very low star-formation rates are to be
expected under such conditions, provided that the large-scale turbulence sets
the gas dynamics in molecular clouds. Our results illustrate that jets may
create large molecular reservoirs as expected in 'positive feedback' scenarios
of AGN-triggered star formation, but that this alone is not sufficient to
trigger star formation.

or a light quark and dominant decay modes Q->Wq' or Q->Zq. We show that current
experimental searches are unable to probe the model, but that minimal
departures from these analyses can explore a large region of its parameter
space for the current LHC luminosity. This includes the challenging case with
the new quarks decaying mostly into light quark flavors. In some channels not
only the heavy quark but also the massive gluon can be reconstructed, which
would stablish the origin of the t\bar{t} asymmetry. Similar analyses can be
applied to more general models with new massive gluons and vectorlike quarks.

increased spectral weight, resulting in non-Fermi liquid behavior at the Fermi

this non-Fermi liquid behavior is responsible for the recently observed

main sequence turnoff stars observed by the Sloan Extension for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey. The sample consists of mostly old
thin and thick disk stars, with a minimal contribution from the stellar halo,
in the region 6 < R < 16 kpc, 0.15 < |Z| < 1.5 kpc. The data reveal that the
radial metallicity gradient becomes flat at heights |Z| > 1 kpc. The median
metallicity at large |Z| is consistent with the metallicities seen in outer
disk open clusters, which exhibit a flat radial gradient at [Fe/H] ~ -0.5. We
note that the outer disk clusters are also located at large |Z|; because the
flat gradient extends to small R for our sample, there is some ambiguity in
whether the observed trends for clusters are due to a change in R or |Z|. We
therefore stress the importance of considering both the radial and vertical
directions when measuring spatial abundance trends in the disk. The flattening
of the gradient at high |Z| also has implications on thick disk formation
scenarios, which predict different metallicity patterns in the thick disk. A
flat gradient, such as we observe, is predicted by a turbulent disk at high
redshift, but may also be consistent with radial migration, as long as mixing
is strong. We test our analysis methods using a mock catalog based on the model

clusters (NSCs), massive globular clusters spiral into the center of a galaxy
and merge to form the nucleus. It is now known that at least some NSCs coexist
with supermassive black holes (SBHs); this is the case, for instance, in the
Milky Way (MW). In this paper, we investigate how the presence of a SMBH at the
center of the MW impacts the merger hypothesis for the formation of its NSC.
Starting from a model consisting of a low-density nuclear stellar disk and the
SMBH, we use N-body simulations to follow the successive inspiral and merger of
globular clusters. The clusters are started on circular orbits of radius 20 pc,
and their initial masses and radii are set up in such a way as to be consistent
with the galactic tidal field at that radius. The total accumulated mass by ~10
clusters is about 1.5x10^7 Solar masses. Each cluster is disrupted by the SMBH
at a distance of roughly one parsec. The density profile that results after the
final inspiral event is characterized by a core of roughly this radius, and an
envelope with density that falls off as 1/r^2. These properties are similar to
those of the MW NSC, with the exception of the core size, which in the MW is a
little smaller. But by continuing the evolution of the model after the final
inspiral event, we find that the core shrinks substantially via gravitational
encounters in a time (when scaled to the MW) of 10 Gyr as the stellar
distribution evolves toward a Bahcall-Wolf cusp. We also show that the
luminosity function of the MW NSC is consistent with the hypothesis that a
large fraction of the mass comes from (~10Gyr) old stars, brought in by
globular clusters. We conclude that a model in which a large fraction of the
mass of the MW NSC arose from infalling globular clusters is consistent with
existing observational constraints.

new materials with enhanced properties, especially higher superconducting
transition temperatures T$_{c}$. The unexpected discovery of high T$_{c}$
superconductivity in cuprates and in materials as diverse as heavy fermions,
organic conductors, and endohedrally-doped fullerenes suggests that the highest
T$_{c}$s occur when pressure or doping transform the localized and
moment-bearing electrons in antiferromagnetic insulators into itinerant and
weakly magnetic metals. The absence of this delocalization transition in
Fe-based superconductors may limit their T$_{c}$s, but even larger T$_{c}$s may
be possible in their isostructural Mn analogs, which are antiferromagnetic
insulators like the cuprates. It is generally believed that prohibitively large
pressures would be required to suppress the strong Hund's rule coupling in
these Mn-based compounds, collapsing the insulating gap and enabling
superconductivity. Indeed, no Mn-based compounds are known to be
superconductors. The electronic structure calculations and x-ray diffraction
measurements presented here challenge these long held beliefs, finding that
only modest pressures are required to transform LaMnPO, isostructural to
superconducting host LaFeAsO, from an insulating tetragonal structure with a
large Mn moment to a gapless orthorhombic structure with a small Mn moment.
Proximity to this electronic delocalization transition in LaMnPO results in a
highly interacting metallic state, the familiar breeding ground of
superconductivity.

time, spatial/temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus, for
instance, increasing the time efficiency of MRI often comes at the expense of
reduced SNR. This, in turn, necessitates the use of post-processing tools for
noise rejection, which makes image de-noising an indispensable component of
computer assistance diagnosis. In the field of MRI, a multitude of image
de-noising methods have been proposed hitherto. In this paper, the application
of a particular class of de-noising algorithms - known as non-local mean (NLM)
filters - is investigated. Such filters have been recently applied for MRI data
enhancement and they have been shown to provide more accurate results as
compared to many alternative de-noising algorithms. Unfortunately, virtually
all existing methods for NLM filtering have been derived under the assumption
of additive white Gaussian (AWG) noise contamination. Since this assumption is
known to fail at low values of SNR, an alternative formulation of NLM filtering
is required, which would take into consideration the correct Rician statistics
of MRI noise. Accordingly, the contribution of the present paper is two-fold.
First, it points out some principal disadvantages of the earlier methods of NLM
filtering of MRI images and suggests means to rectify them. Second, the paper
introduces a new similarity measure for NLM filtering of MRI Images, which is
derived under bona fide statistical assumptions and results in more accurate
reconstruction of MR scans as compared to alternative NLM approaches. Finally,
the utility and viability of the proposed method is demonstrated through a
series of numerical experiments using both in silico and in vivo MRI data.

Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons modified gravity as special
cases. We analytically derive and solve the coupled field equations in the
post-Newtonian approximation, assuming a comparable-mass, spinning black hole
binary source in a quasi-circular, weak-field/slow-motion orbit. We find that a
naive subtraction of divergent piece associated with the point-particle
approximation is ill-suited to represent compact objects in these theories.
Instead, we model them by appropriate effective sources built so that known
strong-field solutions are reproduced in the far-field limit. In doing so, we
prove that black holes in Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons theory
can have hair, while neutron stars have no scalar monopole charge, in
diametrical opposition to results in scalar-tensor theories. We then employ
techniques similar to the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations
to obtain analytic expressions for the scalar field, metric perturbation, and
the associated gravitational wave luminosity measured at infinity. We find that
scalar field emission mainly dominates the energy flux budget, sourcing
electric-type (even-parity) dipole scalar radiation and magnetic-type
(odd-parity) quadrupole scalar radiation, correcting the General Relativistic
prediction at relative -1PN and 2PN orders. Such modifications lead to
corrections in the emitted gravitational waves that can be mapped to the

stellar kinematics obtained with the VIRUS-P integral-field spectrograph and
anisotropic Jeans models as a test of cosmological simulations and baryonic
processes that putatively alter small-scale structure. Previous measurements of
the H-alpha emission-line kinematics have determined that the dark matter halo
of NGC 2976 is most consistent with a cored density profile. We find that the
stellar kinematics are best fit with a cuspy halo. Cored dark matter halo fits
are only consistent with the stellar kinematics if the stellar mass-to-light
ratio is significantly larger than that derived from stellar population
synthesis, while the best-fitting cuspy model has no such conflict. The
inferred mass distribution from a harmonic decomposition of the gaseous
kinematics is inconsistent with that of the stellar kinematics. This difference
is likely due to the gas disk not meeting the assumptions that underlie the
analysis such as no pressure support, a constant kinematic axis, and planar
orbits. By relaxing some of these assumptions, in particular the form of the
kinematic axis with radius, the gas-derived solution can be made consistent
with the stellar kinematic models. A strong kinematic twist in the gas of NGC

caused by angular momentum loss (AML) driven by magnetic braking and
gravitational radiation (GR) above the period gap, and solely by GR below the
period gap. The best-fit revised model of CV evolution recently by
\citet{kbp11}, however, indicates that AML rate below the period gap is
$2.47(\pm 0.22)$ times the GR rate, suggesting the existence of some other AML
mechanisms. We consider several kinds of consequential AML mechanisms often
invoked in the literature: isotropic wind from the accreting white dwarfs,
outflows from the Langrangian points, and the formation of a circumbinary disk.
We found that neither isotropic wind from the white dwarf nor outflow from the
$L_1$ point can explain the extra AML rate, while ouflow from the $L_2$ point
or a circumbinary disk can effectively extract the angular momentum provided
that $\sim (15-45)%$ of the transferred mass is lost from the binary. A more
promising mechanism is a circumbinary disk exerting gravitational torque on the
binary. In this case the mass loss fraction can be as low as $\lesssim
10^{-3}$.

an important acceleration mechanism in a variety of astrophysical objects
including extragalactic jets in active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts.
These sources remain good candidate sites for the generation of ultra-high
energy cosmic rays. In this paper, key predictions of DSA at relativistic
shocks that are germane to production of relativistic electrons and ions are
outlined. The technique employed to identify these characteristics is a Monte
Carlo simulation of such diffusive acceleration in test-particle, relativistic,
oblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks. Using a compact prescription for
diffusion of charges in MHD turbulence, this approach generates particle
angular and momentum distributions at any position upstream or downstream of
the shock. Simulation output is presented for both small angle and large angle
scattering scenarios, and a variety of shock obliquities including superluminal
regimes when the de Hoffmann-Teller frame does not exist. The distribution
function power-law indices compare favorably with results from other
techniques. They are found to depend sensitively on the mean magnetic field
orientation in the shock, and the nature of MHD turbulence that propagates
along fields in shock environs. An interesting regime of flat spectrum
generation is addressed; we provide evidence for it being due to shock drift
acceleration, a phenomenon well-known in heliospheric shock studies. The impact
of these theoretical results on blazar science is outlined. Specifically,
Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations of these relativistic jet sources are
providing significant constraints on important environmental quantities for
relativistic shocks, namely the field obliquity, the frequency of scattering
and the level of field turbulence.

Despite the similar ferromagnetic electrode and interfacial roughness in both

features of the ISD depending on the host SC. The precession and relaxation of
spins in different SCs exposed to the local fields from more or less the same

CoFe/MgO/Si contact, but a small ISD in the CoFe/MgO/Ge contact. The ISD of the
CoFe/MgO/Ge contact has been substantially increased at low temperature. These
results can be ascribed to the difference of spin relaxation in host SCs. A
model calculation of the ISD, considering the spin precession due to the local

targeting the active site is a straightforward strategy of enzyme inhibition,
evidences of allosteric modulation of active site in many enzymes underscore
the molecular origin of signal transduction. Information of co-evolving
sequences in SAHH family and the key residues for functional dynamics that can
be identified using native topology of the enzyme provide glimpses into how the
allosteric signaling network, dispersed over the molecular structure,
coordinates intra- and inter-subunit conformational dynamics. To study the link
between the allosteric communication and functional dynamics of SAHHs, we
performed Brownian dynamics simulations by building a coarse-grained model
based on the holo and ligand-bound structures. The simulations of
ligand-induced transition revealed that the signal of intra-subunit closure
dynamics is transmitted to form inter-subunit contacts, which in turn invoke a
precise alignment of active site, followed by the dimer-dimer rotation that
compacts the whole tetrameric structure. Further analyses of SAHH dynamics
associated with ligand binding provided evidence of both induced fit and
population shift mechanisms, and also showed that the transition state ensemble
is akin to the ligand-bound state. Besides the formation of enzyme-ligand
contacts at the active site, the allosteric couplings from the residues distal
to the active site is vital to the enzymatic function.

technique into the Fourier pseudo-spectral solution of the vorticity-velocity
formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The
immersed boundary conditions are implemented via direct modification of the
convection and diffusion terms, and therefore, in contrast to many other
similar methods, there is not an explicit external forcing function in the
present formulation. The desired immersed boundary conditions are approximated
on some regular grid points, using different orders (up to second-order)
polynomial extrapolations. At the beginning of each timestep, the solenoidal
velocities (also satisfying the desired immersed boundary conditions), are
obtained and fed into a conventional pseudo-spectral solver, together with a
modified vorticity. The zero-mean pseudo-spectral solution is employed, and
therefore, the method is applicable to the confined flows with zero mean
velocity and vorticity, and without mean vorticity dynamics. In comparison to
the classical Fourier pseudo-spectral solution, the method needs ${\cal
O}(4(1+\log N)N)$ more operations for boundary condition settings. Therefore,
the computational cost of the method, as a whole, is scaled by ${(N \log N)}$.
The classical explicit fourth-order Runge--Kutta method is used for time
integration, and the boundary conditions are set at the beginning of each
sub-step, in order to increasing the time accuracy. The method is applied to
some fixed and moving boundary problems, with different orders of boundary
conditions; and in this way, the accuracy and performance of the method are
investigated and compared with the classical Fourier pseudo-spectral solutions.

constructed and a set of crust and core equations of state that span the range
of nuclear experimental uncertainty in the density dependence of the symmetry
energy from 25 MeV (soft EOS) to 115 MeV (stiff EOS), we calculate the
instability window for the onset of the Chandrasekhar-Friedmann-Schutz (CFS)
instability in r-mode oscillations for canonical neutron stars (1.4 M_{\odot})
and massive neutron stars (2.0 M_{\odot}). In these models the crust-core
transition density, and thus crustal thickness, is calculated consistently with
the core equation of state (EOS). For the canonical neutron star, the lower
bound of the r-mode instability window is reduced in frequency by \approx150 Hz
from the softest to the stiffest symmetry energy used, independent of mass and
temperature. The instability window also drops by \approx 100 Hz independent of
EOS when the mass is raised from 1.4 M_{\odot} to 2.0 M_{\odot}. Where
temperature estimates are available, the observed neutron stars in low mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs) have frequencies below the instability window for the
1.4 M_{\odot} models, while some LMXBs fall within the instability window for
2.0 M_{\odot} stars if the symmetry energy is relatively stiff, indicating that
a softer symmetry energy is more consistent with observations within this
model. Thus we conclude that smaller values of L help stabilize neutron stars
against runaway r-mode oscillations. The critical temperature, below which no
star can reach the instability window without exceeding its Kepler frequency,
varies by nearly an order of magnitude from soft to stiff symmetry energies.
When the crust thickness and core EOS are treated consistently, a thicker crust
corresponds to a lower critical temperature, the opposite result to previous
studies in which the transition density was independent of the core EOS.

to select one of the many produced solutions as the final one, especially in
the case of more than two objectives.
  To overcome the above mentioned drawbacks number of EMOA's incorporating the

possible to save objective function evaluations by generating only the part of
the front the DM is interested in, thus also narrowing down the pool of
possible selections for the final solution.
  Unfortunately, most of the current EMO approaches utilizing preferences are
not very intuitive to use, i.e. they may require tweaking of unintuitive
parameters, and it is not always clear what kind of results one can get with
given set of parameters. In this study we propose a new approach to visually
inspect produced solutions, and to extract preference information from the DM

emission of some blazars is hard, with spectral indices 0.5 < alpha < 1. The
absorption depends on the level of extragalactic background light (EBL) that is
difficult to measure directly. This implies that it is difficult to estimate
the slope of the intrinsic TeV emission. To test our blazar emission scenario
that is capable to reproducing the hard spectra, we therefore used the
observations made by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in the unabsorbed
MeV-GeV energy range. We assume that the X-ray and gamma-ray emission of TeV
blazars is produced in a compact region of a jet uniformly filled by particles
of relatively high energy (g >~ 10^3, E=g m_e c^2). In other words, we assume a
low energy cut-off in the particle energy distribution. The emission produced
by the particles with this energy spectrum can explain hard intrinsic spectra
in the energy range from MeV up to TeV. We demonstrate how to estimate the
basic physical parameters of a source in this case and how to explain the
observed spectra by a precise simulation of the particle energy evolution. To
test our estimation methods, we use the observations of two blazars with
exceptionally hard spectral indices (alpha <~ 0.5) in the MeV-GeV range and
known redshifts: RGB J0710+591 and 1ES 0502+675. The estimated values of the
Doppler factor and magnetic field are compared with our numerical simulations,
which confirm that the particle energy distribution with a low energy cut--off
can explain the observed hard spectra well. In addition, we demonstrate that
the radiative cooling caused by the inverse-Compton emission in the
Klein-Nishina regime may help us to explain the hard spectra.

have shown that the infrared spectra of post-AGB disc sources are dominated by
silicate dust emission, often with an extremely high crystallinity fraction.
However, the three sources described here are selected because they show a
peculiar molecular chemistry. Methods. Using Spitzer infrared spectroscopy, we
study in detail the peculiar mineralogy of the three sample stars. Using the
observed emission features, we identify the different observed dust, molecular
and gas species. Results. The infrared spectra show emission features due to
various oxygen-rich dust components, as well as CO2 gas. All three sources show
the strong infrared bands generally ascribed to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. Furthermore, two sample sources show C60 fullerene bands.
Conclusions. Even though the majority of post-AGB disc sources are dominated by
silicate dust in their circumstellar environment, we do find evidence that, for
some sources at least, additional processing must occur to explain the presence
of large carbonaceous molecules. There is evidence that some of these sources
are still oxygen-rich, which makes the detection of these molecules even more
surprising.

of binding processes. It is an essential tool for probing properties of
reactions in many biochemical systems. Here we analyze existing experimental
data and demonstrate that the Hill coefficient characterizing the binding of
transcription factors to their cognate sites can in fact be larger than one --
the standard indication of cooperativity -- even in the absence of any standard
cooperative binding mechanism. By studying the problem analytically, we
demonstrate that this effect occurs due to the disordered binding energy of the
transcription factor to the DNA molecule and the steric interactions between
the different copies of the transcription factor. We show that the enhanced
Hill coefficient implies a significant reduction in the number of copies of the
transcription factors which is needed to occupy a cognate site and, in many
cases, can explain existing estimates for numbers of the transcription factors
in cells. The mechanism is general and should be applicable to other biological
recognition processes.

protein aggregation. Normally, the excitation is completely reversible and the
key role is played here by ATP (adenosine-5'-triphosphate) which disaggregates
proteins of cytomatrix. The same effect ATP exerts during cell injury by
eliciting a ""healing"" effect. Damage of cell structures we consider as

aggregation of any origin we will call ""a cure"". The latter is considered as
physical process of cell recovering from excitation/injury to resting state,

reduction of effective temperature of cell proteins due to binding
intracellular water which is present in the cell at concentration of

  Calcutta, Kolkata, India",,,,"gr-qc hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  This thesis is focussed towards the applications of the quantum tunneling
mechanism to study black holes. Here we give a general frame work of the
existing tunneling mechanism, both the radial null geodesic and Hamilton Jacobi
methods. On the radial null geodesic method side, we study the modifications to
the tunneling rate, Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein- Hawking area law by
including the back reaction as well as non-commutative effects in the
space-time. A reformulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) method is first
introduced. Based on this, a close connection between the quantum tunneling and
the gravitational anomaly mechanisms to discuss Hawking effect, is put
forwarded. An interesting advantage of this reformulated HJ method is that one
can get directly the emission spectrum from the event horizon of the black
hole, which was missing in the earlier literature. Also, the quantization of
the entropy and area of a black hole is discussed in this method. Another part
of the thesis is the introduction of a new type of global embedding of curved
space-time to higher dimensional Minkowskian space-time (GEMS). Using this a
unified description of the Hawking and Unruh effects is given. Advantage of
this approach is, it simplifies as well as generalises the conventional
embedding. In addition to the spherically symmetric space-times, the
Kerr-Newman black hole is exemplified. Finally, following the above ideas and
the definition of partition function for gravity, it is shown that
extremization of entropy leads to the Einstein's equations of motion. In this
frame work, a relation between the entropy, energy and the temperature of a
black hole is given where energy is shown to be the Komar expression.
Interestingly, this relation is the generalized Smarr formula. In this
analysis, the GEMS method provides the law of equipartition of energy as an
intermediate step.

Currently, typical genome-wide association studies measure hundreds of
thousands, or millions, of genetic variants (SNPs), in thousands or tens of
thousands of individuals, and attempt to identify regions harboring SNPs that
affect some phenotype or outcome of interest. This goal can naturally be cast
as a variable selection regression problem, with the SNPs as the covariates in
the regression. Characteristic features of genome-wide association studies
include the following: (i) a focus primarily on identifying relevant variables,
rather than on prediction; and (ii) many relevant covariates may have tiny
effects, making it effectively impossible to confidently identify the complete
""correct"" subset of variables. Taken together, these factors put a premium on
having interpretable measures of confidence for individual covariates being
included in the model, which we argue is a strength of BVSR compared with
alternatives such as penalized regression methods. Here we focus primarily on
analysis of quantitative phenotypes, and on appropriate prior specification for
BVSR in this setting, emphasizing the idea of considering what the priors imply
about the total proportion of variance in outcome explained by relevant
covariates. We also emphasize the potential for BVSR to estimate this
proportion of variance explained, and hence shed light on the issue of ""missing
heritability"" in genome-wide association studies.

detect significant variability in the strong, broad emission lines, despite
large optical continuum variations. This suggests that the relativistic jet has
little influence on the output of the broad emission-line region, possibly
either because the highly beamed continuum ionizes only a small portion of the

the 21 cm line and found that the HI associated to the starburst region forms a

~50-100 Msun/pc^2 (~0.6-1.2 x 10^22 atoms/cm^2). The rotation curve is flat
with a steep rise in the inner parts, indicating the presence of a strong
central concentration of mass. Mass models with a dark matter halo show that
baryons may dominate the gravitational potential in the inner regions. A radial
inflow/outflow motion of ~15 km/s is also present. I Zw 18 appears structurally
different from typical dwarf irregulars in terms of gas distribution, stellar
distribution and dynamics. It may be considered as a ""miniature""
high-surface-brightness disk galaxy. These dynamical properties must be tightly
related to the starburst. They also shed new light on the question of the

enzyme kinetics at these physiologically relevant conditions through a master
equation including stochasticity and molecular discreteness. From the exact
solution of the master equation we find that the waiting times are neither

turnovers form a non-renewal stochastic process. The inverse of the mean
waiting time shows strong departures from the Michaelis-Menten equation. The
waiting times between consecutive turnovers are anti-correlated, where short

nm by surfactants is investigated by means of classical molecular dynamics
simulations. While the well-known melting point depression leads to a much
lower melting of gold nanowires compared to bulk gold, coating the nanowires
with surfactants can reverse this, given that the attractive interaction
between surfactant molecules and gold atoms lies beyond a certain threshold. It
is found that the melting process of coated nanowires is dominated by surface
instability patterns, whereas the melting behaviour of gold nanowires in vacuum
is dominated by the greater mobility of atoms with lower coordination numbers
that are located at edges and corners. The suppression of the melting by
surfactants is explained by the isotropic pressure acting on the gold surface
(due to the attractive interaction) which successfully suppresses

Line Seyfert 1 (BLS1) galaxy CBS 126. A clear Fe emission line and a strong
soft excess are present in the source spectra. We fit the spectra with a
relativistic reflection model and find the model tends to fit the data with a
high iron abundance possibly due to the large soft excess present. By checking
the difference and the RMS spectra, we find there is likely an absorption edge
at $\sim$ 0.89 keV, which might be caused by oxygen or neon. We also produced
an analysis of the time-resolved spectra in order to examine the existence of
the edge. Although high iron abundance is required more in the time-resolved
spectra, a model of solar iron abundance together with an absorption edge gives
a more physical explanation. Variation of the ionisation parameter is an
alternative, plausible explanation for the excess seen in the difference
spectra. It is difficult to know if there are warm absorbers in this source
from the current data. To further investigate the presence of possible warm
absorbers, higher signal-to-noise low-energy data are needed. The work
presented here tentatively suggests that the spectra of a BLS1 can be explained
by a relativistic reflection model similar to that often seen in their
narrow-line cousins.

production of desired compound in a given chemical reaction network by
appropriately directing the mass flow through the network. Computationally,
this problem is addressed as a linear optimization problem over the ""flux
cone"". The prior construction of the flux cone is computationally expensive and
no polynomial-time algorithms are known. Results: Here we show that the output
maximization problem in chemical reaction networks is NP-complete. This
statement remains true even if all reactions are monomolecular or bimolecular
and if only a single molecular species is used as influx. As a corollary we
show, furthermore, that the detection of autocatalytic species, i.e., types
that can only be produced from the influx material when they are present in the
initial reaction mixture, is an NP-complete computational problem. Conclusions:
Hardness results on combinatorial problems and optimization problems are
important to guide the development of computational tools for the analysis of
metabolic networks in particular and chemical reaction networks in general. Our
results indicate that efficient heuristics and approximate algorithms need to
be employed for the analysis of large chemical networks since even conceptually
simple flow problems are provably intractable.

conduction to the surrounding gas, and the thermal conductivity of tip material
adjacent to the apex. It is furthermore allows us to propose a novel design of
the SThM probe that incorporates a carbon nanotube (CNT) or similar high

The new sensor is predicted to provide spatial resolution to the thermal

galaxy clusters is not cooling catastrophically. To large extent, cooling is
offset by heating due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) via jets. The cool-core
clusters, with cooler/denser plasmas, show multiphase gas and signs of some
cooling in their cores. These observations suggest that the cool core is
locally thermally unstable while maintaining global thermal equilibrium. Using
high-resolution, three-dimensional simulations we study the formation of
multiphase gas in cluster cores heated by highly-collimated bipolar AGN jets.
Our key conclusion is that spatially extended multiphase filaments form only
when the instantaneous ratio of the thermal instability and free-fall
timescales (t_TI/t_ff) falls below a critical threshold of \approx 10. When
this happens, dense cold gas decouples from the hot ICM phase and generates
inhomogeneous and spatially extended Halpha filaments. These cold gas clumps
and filaments `rain' down onto the central regions of the core, forming a cold
rotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole. Consequently,
the self-regulated feedback enhances AGN heating and the core returns to a
higher entropy level with t_TI/t_ff > 10. Eventually the core reaches
quasi-stable global thermal equilibrium, and cold filaments condense out of the
hot ICM whenever t_TI/t_ff \lesssim 10. This occurs despite the fact that the
energy from AGN jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion.
The effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the
turbulent motions in the wake of freely-falling cold filaments. Increased AGN
activity can locally reverse the cold gas flow, launching cold filamentary gas
away from the cluster center. Our criterion for the condensation of spatially
extended cold gas is in agreement with observations and previous idealized
simulations.

of the inviscid limit is as least as difficult. However it is not clear if the
additional difficulties linked to the body's dynamic make this issue more
difficult or not. In this paper we consider the motion of a rigid body in an
incompressible fluid occupying the complementary set in the space and we prove
that a Kato type condition implies the convergence of the fluid velocity and of
the body velocity as well, what seems to indicate that an answer in the case of
a fixed boundary could also bring an answer to the case where there is a moving
body in the fluid.

  Observed quasar hosts are consistent with no evolution from the local M(BH) -

M(BH)/M(host) from z=0 to z=3. Taken at face value, this is totally at odds
with the predictions of SAM, where the intrinsic Gamma shows little evolution

massive black holes (10^9-10^10 Msun) at the steep end of the luminosity and

the observations. A proper interpretation of quasar host data thus requires the

does not relax towards the Boltzmann distribution of statistical equilibrium.
This implies either that (i) the ""collisional"" (correlational) relaxation time
is larger than Nt_D, where t_D is the dynamical time, so that three-body,
four-body... correlations must be taken into account in the kinetic theory, or
(ii) that the point vortex gas is non-ergodic (or does not mix well) and will

experience a process of ""collisionless"" (correlationless) violent relaxation

indicates existence of large antiferomagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations for all x.
The T-dependence of 1/T_{1} shows a gap-like behavior below approximately 100 K
for 0.6 < x < 0.9. These behaviors are well explained by the change of band
structure with expansion of hole Fermi surfaces and shrink and disappearance of
electron Fermi surfaces at Brillouin zone (BZ) with increasing x. The
anisotropy of 1/T_{1}, represented by a ratio of 1/T_{1ab} to 1/T_{1c}, is
always larger than 1 for all x, which indicates that the stripe-type AF
fluctuations is dominant in this system. The K in superconducting (SC) state
decreases, which corresponds to appearance of spin-singlet superconductivity.
The T dependence of 1/T_{1} in SC state indicates multiple-SC-gap feature. A

shrinking of the separation of the two holes to sub-pc scales starting from a
realistic major merger between two gas-rich spiral galaxies with mass
comparable to our Milky Way. The simulations, carried out with the Adaptive
Mesh Refinement (AMR) code RAMSES, are capable of resolving separations as
small as 0.1 pc. The collision of the two galaxies produces a gravo-turbulent
rotating nuclear disk with mass (10^9 Msun) and size (60 pc) in excellent
agreement with previous SPH simulations with particle splitting that used a
similar setup (Mayer et al. 2007) but were limited to separations of a few
parsecs. The AMR results confirm that the two black holes sink rapidly as a
result of dynamical friction onto the gaseous background, reaching a separation
of 1 pc in less than 10^7 yr. We show that the dynamical friction wake is well
resolved by our model and we find good agreement with analytical predictions of
the drag force as a function of the Mach number. Below 1 pc, black hole pairing
slows down significantly, as the relative velocity between the sinking SMBH
becomes highly subsonic and the mass contained within their orbit falls below
the mass of the binary itself, rendering dynamical friction ineffective. In
this final stage, the black holes have not opened a gap as the gaseous
background is highly pressurized in the center. Non-axisymmetric gas torques do
not arise to restart sinking in absence of efficient dynamical friction, at
variance with previous calculations using idealized equilibrium nuclear disk
models. (abridged)

of left-invariant evolution schemes acting on Gabor transform, primarily for
applications in signal and image analysis. Within this approach we relate
operators on signals to operators on Gabor transforms. In order to obtain a
translation and modulation invariant operator on the space of signals, the
corresponding operator on the reproducing kernel space of Gabor transforms must
be left invariant, i.e. it should commute with the left regular action of the
reduced Heisenberg group H_r. By using the left-invariant vector fields on H_r
in the generators of our evolution equations on Gabor transforms, we naturally
employ the essential group structure on the domain of a Gabor transform. Here
we distinguish between two tasks. Firstly, we consider non-linear adaptive
left-invariant convection (reassignment) to sharpen Gabor transforms, while
maintaining the original signal. Secondly, we consider signal enhancement via
left-invariant diffusion on the corresponding Gabor transform. We provide
numerical experiments and analytical evidence for our methods and we consider
an explicit medical imaging application.

vanishing HOMO-LUMO gaps. A sequence of polyproline I helix molecules is also
studied, and it is found that self-consistency calculations using pure
functionals fail to converge for helices longer than six proline units. Since
the computed gap is strongly correlated to the fraction of Hartree-Fock
exchange, test calculations using both pure and hybrid density functionals are
reported. The tested methods include the pure functionals BLYP, PBE, and LDA,
as well as Hartree-Fock and the hybrid functionals BHandHLYP, B3LYP, and PBE0.
The effect of including solvent molecules in the calculations is studied, and
it is found that the inclusion of explicit solvent molecules around the protein
fragment in many cases gives a larger gap, but that convergence problems due to
vanishing gaps still occur in calculations with pure functionals. In order to
achieve converged results, some modeling of the charge distribution of solvent
water molecules outside the electronic structure calculation is needed.
Representing solvent water molecules by a simple point charge distribution is
found to give non-vanishing HOMO-LUMO gaps for the tested protein-like systems

that the low-temperature tunnelling transport of Cooper pairs is mediated by a
self-generated environment of dipole excitations comprised of the same
particles as the tunnelling charge carriers in accord with the early notion by
Fleishman, Licciardello, and Anderson. We derive an analytical expression for
the current-voltage characteristic and find that at temperatures, T, below the
the charging energy of a single junction, E_c, the dc transport is completely
locked by Coulomb blockade effect at all voltages except for a discrete set of
resonant ones. At T>E_c the combined action of disorder and temperature unlocks
the charge transport, since the environment excitation spectrum becomes
quasi-continuous according to a Landau-Hopf-like scenario of turbulence, and
the conductivity acquires an Arrhenius-like thermal activation form. The
transition from the localized to delocalized behaviour occurs at T=E_c which
corresponds to the onset of turbulence in the spectral flow of environmental
excitations with Reynolds number Re=(k_B T/E_c)=1. The proposed theory breaks
ground for a quantitative description of dynamic and quantum phase transitions

we introduce as in \cite{Hprepa} a new unknown,\textit{a effective velocity}

the fluid) with $\mu$ the viscosity coefficient which simplifies the system and
allow us to cancel out the coupling between the velocity $u$ and the depth

project $m_{0}^{'}$ on the divergence field. These solutions are in some sense
\textit{purely compressible}. We would like to point out that the friction term
term has a fundamental role in our work inasmuch as coupling with the pressure
term it creates a damping effect on the effective velocity.

dynamics of the system of interest. At second order, there are additionally two
separate and very different contributions. One is a term taking into account
the second order contributions of the fluctuations in the coupling, which can
be parametrized as a stochastic forcing with given spectral properties. The
other one is a memory term, coupling the system of interest to its previous
history, through the correlations of the second system. If these correlations
are known, this effect can be implemented as a perturbation with memory on the
single system. In order to treat this case, we present an extension to Ruelle's
response theory able to deal with integral operators. We discuss our results in
the context of other methods previously proposed to disentangle the dynamics of
two coupled systems. We emphasize that our results do not rely on assuming a
time scale separation, and, if such a separation exist, can be used equally
well to study the statistics of the slow as well as that of the fast variables.
By recursively applying the technique proposed here, we can treat the general
case of multilevel systems.

tracking parameters, to understand tracking algorithms' susceptibility to
noise, and to estimate flow lifetimes. Tracking parameters varied include: time
interval $\Delta t$ between magnetogram pairs tracked, spatial binning applied
to the magnetograms, and windowing parameter $\sigma$ used in FLCT. Flow
structures vary over a range of spatial and temporal scales (including
unresolved scales), so tracked flows represent a local average of the flow over
a particular range of space and time. We define flow lifetime to be the flow
decorrelation time, $\tau$. For $\Delta t > \tau$, tracking results represent
the average velocity over one or more flow lifetimes. We analyze lifetimes of
flow components, divergences, and curls as functions of magnetic field strength
and spatial scale. We find a significant trend of increasing lifetimes of flow
components, divergences, and curls with field strength, consistent with Lorentz
forces partially governing flows in the active photosphere, as well as strong
trends of increasing flow lifetime and decreasing magnitudes with increases in
both spatial scale and $\Delta t$.

gamma-ray emission measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in the energy
range from 100 MeV to 100 GeV in order to probe the gas and cosmic-ray content
over the scale of the whole Cygnus complex. The signal from bright pulsars is
largely reduced by selecting photons in their off-pulse phase intervals. We
compare the diffuse gamma-ray emission with interstellar gas maps derived from
radio/mm-wave lines and visual extinction data, and a global model of the
region, including other pulsars and gamma-ray sources, is sought. The integral
HI emissivity and its spectral energy distribution are both consistent within
the systematics with LAT measurements in the interstellar space near the solar
system. The average X=N(H2)/W(CO) ratio is consistent with other LAT
measurements in the Local Arm. We detect significant gamma-ray emission from
dark neutral gas for a mass corresponding to ~40% of that traced by CO. Despite
the conspicuous star formation activity and large masses of the interstellar

two typical dissipative systems with anomalous spectral densities are studied
by investigating on their low-temperature quantum behavior. In all cases it is
found that the entropy decays quickly and vanishes as the temperature
approaches zero. This reveals a good conformity with the third law of
thermodynamics and provides another evidence for the validity of fundamental
thermodynamical laws in the quantum dissipative region.

for anisotropic propagation of light. This paper explores a different
possibility, in which light is still assumed to propagate isotropically in all
frames with an invariant speed, yet other physical effects exhibit a direction
dependence. If spatial isotropy is not assumed in the derivation of the
coordinates transformations, the resulting equations differ from the Lorentz
relations by an additional factor $(\dfrac{c - v}{c + v})^{\kappa}$, where
$\kappa$ is the anisotropy exponent, which depends on the direction chosen as
the x-axis. Time dilation and length contractions become direction dependent.
The anisotropy exponent is frame-independent, so no preferred isotropic frame
exists if $\kappa$ is non-vanishing. The Doppler shift can be used to measure
this exponent and determine experimentally the degree of anisotropy our
universe actually possesses.
