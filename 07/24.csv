  chapter 7 to chapter 4, with additions to the discussion. Updated chapter 7
  because of this change. Other minor changes",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper is about 'absolute logic': an approach to logic that differs from
the standard first-order logic and other known approaches. It should be a new
approach the author has created proposing to obtain a general and unifying
approach to logic and a faithful model of human mathematical deductive process.
In first-order logic there exist two different concepts of term and formula, in
place of these two concepts in our approach we have just one notion of
expression. In our system the set-builder notation is an expression-building
pattern. In our system we can easily express second-order, third order and
any-order conditions. The meaning of a sentence will depend solely on the
meaning of the symbols it contains, it will not depend on external
'structures'. Our deductive system is based on a very simple definition of
proof and provides a good model of human mathematical deductive process. The
soundness and consistency of the system are proved. We discuss on the
completeness of our deductive systems. We also discuss how our system relates
to the most know types of paradoxes, from the discussion no specific
vulnerability to paradoxes comes out. The paper provides both the theoretical
material and a fully documented example of deduction.

  and references added",,"10.1007/JHEP12(2011)069",,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that when supersymmetry is broken at the TeV scale by strong
dynamics, the Higgs sector of the MSSM can be drastically modified. This arises
from possible sizeable mixings of the Higgs with the resonances of the strong
sector. In particular the mass of the lightest Higgs boson can be significantly
above the MSSM bound (~130 GeV). Furthermore only one Higgs doublet is strictly
necessary, because the Yukawa couplings can have a very different structure
compared to the MSSM. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence electroweak precision
observables can be calculated and shown to be below experimental bounds. The
most natural way to generate sparticle masses is through mixing with the
composite states. This causes the gauginos and Higgsinos to easily obtain Dirac
masses around 200 GeV, while scalar masses can be generated either from extra
D-terms or also through mixing with the strongly-coupled states. Finally one of
the most interesting predictions of these scenarios is the sizeable decay width
of the Higgs boson into a very light gravitino (~ 10^{-4} eV) and a Higgsino.

memoryless networks is presented. A general transmission scheme for any
memoryless, single-hop, k-user channel with or without common information, is
defined through two steps. The first step is user virtualization: each user is
divided into multiple virtual sub-users according to a chosen rate-splitting
strategy which preserves the rates of the original messages. This results in an
enhanced channel with a possibly larger number of users for which more coding
possibilities are available. Moreover, user virtualization provides a simple
mechanism to encode common messages to any subset of users. Following user
virtualization, the message of each user in the enhanced model is coded using a
chosen combination of coded time-sharing, superposition coding and joint
binning. A graph is used to represent the chosen coding strategies: nodes in
the graph represent codewords while edges represent coding operations. This
graph is used to construct a graphical Markov model which illustrates the
statistical dependency among codewords that can be introduced by the
superposition coding or joint binning. Using this statistical representation of
the overall codebook distribution, the error probability of the code is shown
to vanish via a unified analysis. The rate bounds that define the achievable
rate region are obtained by linking the error analysis to the properties of the
graphical Markov model. This proposed framework makes it possible to
numerically obtain an achievable rate region by specifying a user
virtualization strategy and describing a set of coding operations. The largest
achievable rate region can be obtained by considering all the possible
rate-splitting strategies and taking the union over all the possible ways to
superimpose or bin codewords.

notions in derandomization theory to problems outside the core of theoretical
computer science, and in particular, certain problems related to coding theory.
  First, we consider the wiretap channel problem which involves a communication
system in which an intruder can eavesdrop a limited portion of the
transmissions, and construct efficient and information-theoretically optimal
communication protocols for this model. Then we consider the combinatorial
group testing problem. In this classical problem, one aims to determine a set
of defective items within a large population by asking a number of queries,
where each query reveals whether a defective item is present within a specified
group of items. We use randomness condensers to explicitly construct optimal,
or nearly optimal, group testing schemes for a setting where the query outcomes
can be highly unreliable, as well as the threshold model where a query returns
positive if the number of defectives pass a certain threshold. Finally, we
design ensembles of error-correcting codes that achieve the
information-theoretic capacity of a large class of communication channels, and
then use the obtained ensembles for construction of explicit capacity achieving
codes.

of the return probability, $P_\infty$. Because of the valley degree of freedom,
the analysis is more complex than in, for example, GaAs quantum dots, which
have two distinct $P_\infty$ values depending on the magnetic field. Here the
prepared state and the measured state is non-unique because two electrons in
the same dot are allowed in six different states. Moreover, for one electron in
each dot sixteen states exist and therefore are available for being mixed by
the hyperfine field. The return probability experiment is found to be strongly
dependent on the prepared state, on the external magnetic field---both Zeeman
and orbital effects - and on the spin-orbit splitting. The lowest saturation
value, being $P_\infty$=1/3, occurs at zero magnetic field for nanotubes with
spin-orbit coupling and the initial state being the groundstate, this situation
is equivalent to double dots without the valley degree of freedom. In total, we
report nine dynamically different situations that give $P_\infty$=1/3, 3/8,
2/5, 1/2 and for valley anti-symmetric prepared states in an axial magnetic
field, $P_\infty$=1. When the groundstate is prepared the ratio between the

$O((n/\log n)^{1/2}m)$ for dense graphs with $m=\Theta(n^2)$ [Alt et al. 1991].

standard model with the energy cutoff regularization both for stationary and
non-stationary backgrounds at the one-loop level. The problem concerning
singularity of the effective potential for the Higgs field on the horizon of a
black hole, which was reported earlier, is resolved. The equations
characterizing the properties of the vacuum state are derived and solved in a
certain approximation for the Schwarzschild black hole. The gravitational
mass-shift effect is completely described in this case. The masses of the
massive particles in the standard model are shown to depend on the value of the
Higgs boson mass in the flat spacetime. If the Higgs boson mass in the flat
spacetime is less than 263.6 GeV, then the mass of any massive particle
approaching a gravitating object grows. If the Higgs boson mass in the flat
spacetime is greater than or equal to 278.2 GeV, the masses of all the massive
particles decrease in a strong gravitational field. The Higgs boson masses
lying in between these two values prove to lead to instability, at least at the

A graph is {\em $\mc{F}$-free} if it
contains no copy of a graph in $\mc{F}$ as a subgraph. A cornerstone of
extremal graph theory is the study of the {\em Tur\'an number} $ex(n,\mc{F})$,
the maximum number of edges in an $\mc{F}$-free graph on $n$ vertices. Define
the {\em Zarankiewicz number} $z(n,\mc{F})$ to be the maximum number of edges
in an $\mc{F}$-free {\em bipartite} graph on $n$ vertices. Let $C_k$ denote a
cycle of length $k$, and let $\mc{C}_k$ denote the set of cycles $C_{\ell}$,
where $3 \le \ell \leq k$ and $\ell$ and $k$ have the same parity. Erd\H{o}s
and Simonovits conjectured that for any family $\mc{F}$ consisting of bipartite
graphs there exists an odd integer $k$ such that $ex(n,\mc{F} \cup \mc{C}_k)
\sim z(n,\mc{F})$. They proved this when $\mc{F}={C_4}$ by showing that
$ex(n,\{C_4,C_5\}) \sim z(n,C_4)$. In this paper, we extend this result by
showing that if $\ell \in \{2,3,5\}$ and $k > 2\ell$ is odd, then
${ex(n,\mc{C}_{2\ell} \cup {C_k}) \sim z(n,\mc{C}_{2\ell})$. Furthermore, if $k
> 2\ell + 2$ is odd, then for infinitely many $n$ we show that the extremal
$\mc{C}_{2\ell} \cup \{C_k\}$-free graphs are bipartite incidence graphs of
generalized polygons. We observe that this exact result does not hold for any
odd $k < 2\ell$, and furthermore the asymptotic result does not hold when
$(\ell,k)$ is $(3,3)$, $(5,3)$ or $(5,5)$. Our proofs make use of
pseudorandomness properties of nearly extremal graphs that are of independent
interest.

the presence of risk averse players (buyers and sellers) in Bayesian settings.
We model risk aversion by a concave utility function, and players play
strategically to maximize their expected utility. Bayesian mechanism design has
usually focused on maximizing expected revenue in a {\em risk neutral}
environment, and no succinct characterization of expected utility maximizing
mechanisms is known even for single-parameter multi-unit auctions.
  We first consider the problem of designing optimal DSIC mechanism for a risk
averse seller in the case of multi-unit auctions, and we give a poly-time
computable SPM that is $(1-1/e-\eps)$-approximation to the expected utility of
the seller in an optimal DSIC mechanism. Our result is based on a novel
application of a correlation gap bound, along with {\em splitting} and {\em
merging} of random variables to redistribute probability mass across buyers.
This allows us to reduce our problem to that of checking feasibility of a small
number of distinct configurations, each of which corresponds to a covering LP.
A feasible solution to the LP gives us the distribution on prices for each
buyer to use in a randomized SPM.
  We next consider the setting when buyers as well as the seller are risk
averse, and the objective is to maximize the seller's expected utility. We
design a truthful-in-expectation mechanism whose utility is a $(1-1/e
-\eps)^3$-approximation to the optimal BIC mechanism under two mild
assumptions. Our mechanism consists of multiple rounds that processes each
buyer in a round with small probability. Lastly, we consider the problem of
revenue maximization for a risk neutral seller in presence of risk averse
buyers, and give a poly-time algorithm to design an optimal mechanism for the
seller.

simultaneous execution two or more goals which will not interfere with each
other at run time. This can be done safely even if such goals can produce
multiple answers. The most successful IAP implementations to date have used
recomputation of answers and sequentially ordered backtracking. While in
principle simplifying the implementation, recomputation can be very inefficient
if the granularity of the parallel goals is large enough and they produce
several answers, while sequentially ordered backtracking limits parallelism.
And, despite the expected simplification, the implementation of the classic
schemes has proved to involve complex engineering, with the consequent
difficulty for system maintenance and extension, while still frequently running
into the well-known trapped goal and garbage slot problems. This work presents
an alternative parallel backtracking model for IAP and its implementation. The
model features parallel out-of-order (i.e., non-chronological) backtracking and
relies on answer memoization to reuse and combine answers. We show that this
approach can bring significant performance advantages. Also, it can bring some
simplification to the important engineering task involved in implementing the
backtracking mechanism of previous approaches.

The Arabic script is cursive and runs from right-to-left; its criteria and

shown that the strong electromagnetic fields can play a catalysing role for a
deconfinement transition. At the qualitative level, the present consideration

In this paper we introduce and analyze a lattice gauge theory model for
graphene, which describes tight binding electrons hopping on the honeycomb
lattice and interacting with a three-dimensional quantum U(1) gauge field. We
perform an exact Renormalization Group analysis, which leads to a renormalized
expansion that is finite at all orders. The flow of the effective parameters is
controlled thanks to Ward Identities and a careful analysis of the discrete
lattice symmetry properties of the model. We show that the Fermi velocity
increases up to the speed of light and Lorentz invariance spontaneously emerges
in the infrared. The interaction produces critical exponents in the response
functions; this removes the degeneracy present in the non interacting case and
allow us to identify the dominant excitations. Finally we add mass terms to the
Hamiltonian and derive by a variational argument the correspondent gap
equations, which have an anomalous non-BCS form, due to the non trivial effects

to couple the atoms, the blue-detuned hollow-beam can confine cold atoms to the
darkest regions of the beam thereby minimizing shifts in the internal states
and making the guide highly robust to heating effects. This single optical beam
is used as both a funnel and guide to maximize the number of atoms into the
fiber. In the proposed experiment, Rb atoms are loaded into a magneto-optical
trap (MOT) above a vertically-oriented optical fiber. We observe a
gravito-optical trapping effect for atoms with high orbital momentum around the
trap axis, which prevents atoms from coupling to the fiber: these atoms lack
the kinetic energy to escape the potential and are thus trapped in the laser
funnel indefinitely. We find that by reducing the dipolar force to the point at
which the trapping effect just vanishes, it is possible to optimize the
coupling of atoms into the fiber. Our simulations predict that by using a
low-power (2.5 mW) and far-detuned (300 GHz) Laguerre-Gaussian beam with a
20-{\mu}m radius core hollow-fiber it is possible to couple 11% of the atoms
from a MOT 9 mm away from the fiber. When MOT is positioned further away,
coupling efficiencies over 50% can be achieved with larger core fibers.

combination of probability with logic programs has given rise to the field of
Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP), leading to languages such as the
Independent Choice Logic, Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs),
Problog, PRISM and others. These languages share a similar distribution
semantics, and methods have been devised to translate programs between these
languages. The complexity of computing the probability of queries to these
general PLP programs is very high due to the need to combine the probabilities
of explanations that may not be exclusive. As one alternative, the PRISM system
reduces the complexity of query answering by restricting the form of programs
it can evaluate. As an entirely different alternative, Possibilistic Logic
Programs adopt a simpler metric of uncertainty than probability. Each of these
approaches -- general PLP, restricted PLP, and Possibilistic Logic Programming
-- can be useful in different domains depending on the form of uncertainty to
be represented, on the form of programs needed to model problems, and on the
scale of the problems to be solved. In this paper, we show how the PITA system,
which originally supported the general PLP language of LPADs, can also
efficiently support restricted PLP and Possibilistic Logic Programs. PITA
relies on tabling with answer subsumption and consists of a transformation
along with an API for library functions that interface with answer subsumption.

for simply-typed syntax: given a signature S, the abstract syntax associated to
S constitutes the initial object in a category of models of S in monads.
However, the iteration principle her theorem provides only accounts for
translations between two languages over a fixed set of object types. We
generalize Zsid\'o's notion of model such that object types may vary, yielding
a larger category, while preserving initiality of the syntax therein. Thus we
obtain an extended initiality theorem for typed abstract syntax, in which
translations between terms over different types can be specified via the
associated category-theoretic iteration operator as an initial morphism. Our
definitions ensure that translations specified via initiality are type-safe,
i.e. compatible with the typing in the source and target language in the
obvious sense. Our main example is given via the propositions-as-types
paradigm: we specify propositions and inference rules of classical and
intuitionistic propositional logics through their respective typed signatures.
Afterwards we use the category--theoretic iteration operator to specify a
double negation translation from the former to the latter. A second example is
given by the signature of PCF. For this particular case, we formalize the
theorem in the proof assistant Coq. Afterwards we specify, via the

spectral diffusion of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to a photonic crystal (PC)
cavity. In this system, spectral diffusion arises in part from charge
fluctuations on the etched surfaces of the PC. We find that these fluctuations
may be suppressed by photo-generated carriers, leading to a reduction of the
measured QD linewidth by a factor of ~2 compared to the case where the
photo-generated carriers are not present. This result demonstrates a possible
means of countering the effects of spectral diffusion in QD-PC cavity systems
and thus may be useful for quantum information applications where narrow QD
linewidths are desired.

with other electrons and their environment. Isolating and detecting a single
flying electron after propagation to perform quantum optics like experiments at
the single electron level is therefore a challenging task. Up to date, only few
experiments have been performed in a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas
where the electron propagates almost ballistically. Flying electrons were
detected via the current generated by an ensemble of electrons and electron
correlations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the
experimental realisation of high efficiency single electron source and single
electron detector for a quantum medium where a single electron is propagating
isolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving
potential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single
electron along the 1D-channel at a speed of 3\mum/ns. When such a quantum
channel is placed between two quantum dots, a single electron can be
transported from one quantum dot to the other, which is several micrometres
apart, with a quantum efficiency of emission and detection of 96% and 92%,
respectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a
timescale shorter than the coherence time T2* of GaAs spin qubits6. Our work
opens new avenues to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the
distant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed matter
system.

generate a natural value of mu/Bmu, while the NMSSM is a natural framework to
solve the mu/Bmu problem. The NMSSM in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking in its
original form does not work well since the singlet field cannot develop a
desired vacuum expectation value. It also suffers from the cosmological domain
wall problem. We study an extension of the model to include additional
vector-like matter, which is charged under the hidden QCD. It is shown that
this simple extension solves both the problems. We study phenomenological and
cosmological implications of this extended models. The lightest Higgs mass can
be as large as 130-140 GeV for some model points.

  Imaging based on Riemannian Structure of Orientation Distribution Functions",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel large deformation diffeomorphic
registration algorithm to align high angular resolution diffusion images
(HARDI) characterized by orientation distribution functions (ODFs). Our
proposed algorithm seeks an optimal diffeomorphism of large deformation between
two ODF fields in a spatial volume domain and at the same time, locally
reorients an ODF in a manner such that it remains consistent with the
surrounding anatomical structure. To this end, we first review the Riemannian
manifold of ODFs. We then define the reorientation of an ODF when an affine
transformation is applied and subsequently, define the diffeomorphic group
action to be applied on the ODF based on this reorientation. We incorporate the
Riemannian metric of ODFs for quantifying the similarity of two HARDI images
into a variational problem defined under the large deformation diffeomorphic
metric mapping (LDDMM) framework. We finally derive the gradient of the cost
function in both Riemannian spaces of diffeomorphisms and the ODFs, and present
its numerical implementation. Both synthetic and real brain HARDI data are used
to illustrate the performance of our registration algorithm.
