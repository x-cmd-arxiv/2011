driven by subsurface flows in several Mm depth. Most of magnetic field is
pushed into a downflow vertex of the subsurface convection pattern, while some
fraction of the flux separates from the main trunk of the spot. Flux separation
in deeper layers is accompanied in the photosphere with light bridge formation
in the early stages and formation of pores separating from the spot at later
stages. Over a time scale of less than a day we see the development of a large
scale flow pattern surrounding the sunspots, which is dominated by a radial
outflow reaching about 50% of the convective rms velocity in amplitude. Several
components of the large scale flow are found to be independent from the
presence of a penumbra and the associated Evershed flow. While the simulated
sunspots lead to blockage of heat flux in the near surface layers, we do not

further demonstrate that the influence of the bottom boundary condition on the

to the CuO2 layers (Mperp and Mpara, respectively) under arbitrary values for
the corresponding components of the applied magnetic field, Hperp and Hpara.
For temperatures close to Tc (in the critical fluctuation region) we observed
Mperp(Hperp,Hpara) Mperp(Hperp,0) and Mpara(Hperp,Hpara)~0, as expected for an
extremely anisotropic material. However, deviations from this behavior are
observed at lower temperatures in the London region. In particular, the Mperp
amplitude under a constant Hperp decreases on increasing Hpara. In turn, in

the rotating sample holder), its amplitude under a constant Hpara becomes
observable on increasing Hperp. Both effects lead to an angular slippage of the
magnetization vector \vec M from the c crystallographic axis when the applied

phenomenologically explained in the framework of Lawrence-Doniach approaches
for single layered superconductors by just assuming a slight angular dependence

excision of the high-density core of the proto-neutron star and the use of an
axis-free overset grid, the models can be followed from the post-bounce
accretion phase for more than one second without imposing any symmetry
restrictions. GW and neutrino emission exhibit the generic time-dependent
features known from 2D models. Non-radial hydrodynamic mass motions in the
accretion layer and their interaction with the outer layers of the
proto-neutron star together with anisotropic neutrino emission give rise to a
GW signal with an amplitude of ~5-20 cm and frequencies 100--500 Hz. The GW
emission from mass motions reaches a maximum before the explosion sets in.
Afterwards the GW signal exhibits a low-frequency modulation, in some cases
describing a quasi-monotonic growth, associated with the non-spherical
expansion of the explosion shock wave and the large-scale anisotropy of the
escaping neutrino flow. Variations of the mass-quadrupole moment due to
convective activity inside the nascent neutron star contribute a high-frequency

exhibit strong variability between the two polarizations, different explosion
simulations and different observer directions, and does not possess any

data-structures are software combining and elimination. Elimination-based
concurrent data-structures allow operations with reverse semantics (such as
push and pop stack operations) to ""collide"" and exchange values without having
to access a central location. Software combining, on the other hand, is
effective when colliding operations have identical semantics: when a pair of
threads performing operations with identical semantics collide, the task of
performing the combined set of operations is delegated to one of the threads
and the other thread waits for its operation(s) to be performed. Applying this
mechanism iteratively can reduce memory contention and increase throughput. The
most highly scalable prior concurrent stack algorithm is the
elimination-backoff stack. The elimination-backoff stack provides high
parallelism for symmetric workloads in which the numbers of push and pop
operations are roughly equal, but its performance deteriorates when workloads
are asymmetric. We present DECS, a novel Dynamic Elimination-Combining Stack
algorithm, that scales well for all workload types. While maintaining the
simplicity and low-overhead of the elimination-bakcoff stack, DECS manages to
benefit from collisions of both identical- and reverse-semantics operations.
Our empirical evaluation shows that DECS scales significantly better than both
blocking and non-blocking best prior stack algorithms.

into a supermassive black hole, are prime candidates for detection with
space-borne milliHertz gravitational wave detectors, similar to the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna. The gravitational waves generated during such
inspirals encode information about the background in which the small object is
moving, providing a tracer of the spacetime geometry and a probe of
strong-field physics. In this paper, we construct approximate,
""analytic-kludge"" waveforms for such inspirals with parameterized
post-Einsteinian corrections that allow for generic, model-independent
deformations of the supermassive black hole background away from the Kerr
metric. These approximate waveforms include all of the qualitative features of
true waveforms for generic inspirals, including orbital eccentricity and
relativistic precession. The deformations of the Kerr metric are modeled using
a recently proposed, modified gravity bumpy metric, which parametrically
deforms the Kerr spacetime while ensuring that three approximate constants of
the motion remain for geodesic orbits: a conserved energy, azimuthal angular
momentum and Carter constant. The deformations represent modified gravity
effects and have been analytically mapped to several modified gravity black
hole solutions in four dimensions. In the analytic kludge waveforms, the
conservative motion is modeled by a post-Newtonian expansion of the geodesic
equations in the deformed spacetimes, which in turn induce modifications to the
radiation-reaction force. These analytic-kludge waveforms serve as a first step
toward complete and model-independent tests of General Relativity with extreme
mass-ratio inspirals.

multi-input, multi-output (MIMO), quasi-static, Rayleigh faded, half-duplex
relay channel is characterized for an arbitrary number of antennas at each node
and in which opportunistic scheduling (or dynamic operation) of the relay is
allowed, i.e., the relay can switch between receive and transmit modes at a
channel dependent time. In this most general case, the diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff is characterized as a solution to a simple, two-variable optimization
problem. This problem is then solved in closed form for special classes of
channels defined by certain restrictions on the numbers of antennas at the
three nodes. The key mathematical tool developed here that enables the explicit
characterization of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is the joint eigenvalue
distribution of three mutually correlated random Wishart matrices. Previously,
without actually characterizing the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, the
optimality in this tradeoff metric of the dynamic compress-and-forward (DCF)
protocol based on the classical compress-and-forward scheme of Cover and El
Gamal was shown by Yuksel and Erkip. However, this scheme requires global
channel state information (CSI) at the relay. In this work, the so-called
quantize-map and forward (QMF) coding scheme due to Avestimehr {\em et} {\em
al} is adopted as the achievability scheme with the added benefit that it
achieves optimal tradeoff with only the knowledge of the (channel dependent)
switching time at the relay node. Moreover, in special classes of the MIMO
half-duplex relay channel, the optimal tradeoff is shown to be attainable even
without this knowledge. Such a result was previously known only for the

a light standard model-like Higgs boson at the electroweak scale. Given the

field convergence and is generally true in transient regime in the asymptotic
sense (when the number of wireless nodes tends to infinity), but, contrary to
widespread belief, may not necessarily hold in stationary regime. The issue is
often related with the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a fixed point

of the associated ordinary differential equation. In this paper, we give a
simple condition that establishes the asymptotic validity of the decoupling

been addressed in the context of standard magnetohydrodynamics, with matter
obeying a barotropic equation of state. In this paper we take a step towards a
more realistic treatment of the problem by considering neutron stars with
interior superfluid components. In this multifluid model stratification
associated with a varying matter composition (the relative proton to neutron
density fraction) enters as a natural ingredient, leading to a non-barotropic
system. After formulating the hydromagnetic equilibrium of
superfluid/superconducting neutron stars as a perturbation problem, we focus on
the particular case of a three-fluid system consisting of superfluid neutrons
and normal protons and electrons. We determine the equilibrium structure of
dipolar magnetic fields with a mixed poloidal-toroidal composition. We find
that, with respect to barotropic models, stratification has the generic effect
of leading to equilibria with a higher fraction of magnetic energy stored in
the toroidal component. However, even in models with strong stratification the
poloidal and toroidal components are comparable, with the former contributing
the bulk of the magnetic energy.

the exact electron's helicity as the spin quantum number we show that the
self-polarization effect exists only for the moderately relativistic electrons
with energy $\gamma = E/mc^2 \lesssim 10$ and only for a non-head-on collision
geometry. In these conditions polarization degree may achieve the values up to
65%, but the effective polarization time is found to be larger than 1\,s even
for a high power optical or infrared laser with intensity parameter $\xi =

makes such a polarization practically unrealizable. We also compare these
results with the ones of some papers where the high degree of polarization was
predicted for ultrarelativistic case. We argue that this apparent contradiction
arises due to the different choice of the spin quantum numbers. In particular,
the quantum numbers which provide the high polarization degree represent

arithmetic geometry in the study of computational problems related to number
fields and function fields over finite fields. The most prominent computational
tasks of infrastructures are the computation of the circumference of the
infrastructure and the generalized discrete logarithms. Both these problems are
not known to have efficient classical algorithms for an arbitrary
infrastructure. Our main contributions are polynomial time quantum algorithms
for one-dimensional infrastructures that satisfy certain conditions. For
instance, these conditions are always fulfilled for infrastructures obtained
from number fields and function fields, both of unit rank one. Since quadratic
number fields give rise to such infrastructures, this algorithm can be used to
solve Pell's equation and the principal ideal problem. In this sense we
generalize Hallgren's quantum algorithms for quadratic number fields, while
also providing a polynomial speedup over them. Our more general approach shows
that these quantum algorithms can also be applied to infrastructures obtained
from complex cubic and totally complex quartic number fields. Our improved way
of analyzing the performance makes it possible to show that these algorithms
succeed with constant probability independent of the problem size. In contrast,
the lower bound on the success probability due to Hallgren decreases as the
fourth power of the logarithm of the circumference. Our analysis also shows
that fewer qubits are required. We also contribute to the study of
infrastructures, and show how to compute efficiently within infrastructures.

cannot simply disappear into the vacuum; SM Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) masses
(i.e. the pre-Higgs-mechanism longitudinal Wand Z masses) must vanish
identically. At 1-loop, the Higgs-VEV is neither UV-QD divergent nor
fine-tuned. Loop-induced-artefact NGB masses absorb all SM UV-QD, which vanish
identically in the Zero-NGB-Mass limit, i.e. the SSB SM. Simply another
(un-familiar) consequence of the Goldstone theorem, no fine-tuning is necessary
for a weak-scale Higgs mass. Our SM results can (almost certainly) be extended
to include all-orders perturbative electro-weak and QCD loops. SM symmetries
(as realized by SSB and the Goldstone theorem) are sufficient to protect the
Higgs mass, and ensure that the SM does not suffer a HFTP. It is un-necessary
to impose any new Beyond the Standard-Model (BSM) symmetries. Mistaken belief
in a 1-loop SM HFTP has historically driven an expectation that new BSM physics
must appear < 14 TeV. But our results re-open the possibility that LHC
discovery potential might be confined to SM physics.

limit on the importance of externally acquired gas (e.g. from mergers and cold
accretion). Slow rotators have a flat distribution of misalignments, indicating
that the dominant source of gas is external. The molecular, ionised and atomic
gas in all the detected galaxies are always kinematically aligned, even when
they are misaligned from the stars, suggesting that all these three phases of
the ISM share a common origin. In addition, we find that the origin of the cold
and warm gas in fast-rotating ETGs is strongly affected by environment, despite
the molecular gas detection rate and mass fractions being fairly independent of
group/cluster membership. Galaxies in dense groups and the Virgo cluster nearly
always have their molecular gas kinematically aligned with the stellar
kinematics, consistent with a purely internal origin. In the field, however,
kinematic misalignments between the stellar and gaseous components indicate
that >46% of local fast-rotating ETGs have their gas supplied from external
sources. We discuss several scenarios which could explain the environmental
dichotomy, but find it difficult to simultaneously explain the kinematic
misalignment difference and the constant detection rate. Furthermore, our
results suggest that galaxy mass may be an important independent factor
associated with the origin of the gas, with the most massive fast-rotating
galaxies in our sample (M_K<-24 mag; stellar mass of >8x10^10 Msun) always
having kinematically aligned gas. (abridged)

three main components, including a two component main cluster A2163-A with mass
ratio 1:8, and its cluster satellite A2163-B. The bimodal mass distribution in
A2163-A is similar to the galaxy density distribution, but appears as spatially
segregated from the brightest X-ray emitting gas region. We discuss the
possible origins of this gas-dark matter offset and suggest the gas core of the
A2163-A subcluster has been stripped away by ram pressure from its dark matter
component. The survival of this gas core to the tidal forces exerted by the
main cluster let us infer a subcluster accretion with a non-zero impact
parameter. Dominated by the most massive component of A2163-A, the mass
distribution of A2163 is well described by a universal Navarro-Frenk-White
profile as shown by a one-dimensional tangential shear analysis, while the
singular-isothermal sphere profile is strongly ruled out. Comparing this
cluster mass profile with profiles derived assuming intracluster medium
hydrostatic equilibrium (H.E.) in two opposite regions of the cluster

the eastern cluster side, presumably due to shock heating. Yielding a cluster
mass estimate of M_{500}=11.18_{-1.46}^{+1.64}\times10^{14}h^{-1}Msun, our mass

common origin. An extremely high abundance of helium (Y~0.4) allows for a
working hypothesis, but its origin is unclear. Peng & Nagai (2009) proposed
that primordial helium sedimentation in dark haloes over cosmic timescales may
lead to extreme helium abundances in galaxy cluster centers. In this scenario
UV upturn should be restricted to brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) only. This
is a clear and testable prediction. We present tests of this hypothesis using
galaxy clusters from Yoon et al. (2008) that were detected by both the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer Medium Imaging Survey.
Using a new UV classification scheme based on far-UV, near-UV, and optical
photometry we found only 5% of cluster elliptical galaxies show a UV upturn,
while 27% and 68% are classified as ""recent star-formation"" and ""UV-weak""
ellipticals, respectively. The data reveal a modest positive dependence of the
UV upturn fraction on galaxy velocity dispersion, which is in agreement with
the earlier findings of Burstein et al. (1988) and possibly with the helium
sedimentation theory. However, we do not see any dependency on rank or
luminosity of galaxies. Besides, BCGs do not show any marked difference in UV
upturn fraction or strength, which is inconsistent with the prediction. We
conclude that the aforementioned helium sedimentation theory and its inferred
environmental effects are not supported by the available data.

systematically on the observed width-luminosity relation. Conversely, we reject
six models with highly asymmetric ignition conditions and a large amount (>1
M_sun) of synthesized 56Ni that yield poor matches to observed SN Ia spectra.
More subtle features of the comparison include the general difficulty of the
models to match the U-band flux at early times, caused by a hot ionized ejecta
that affect the subsequent redistribution of flux at longer wavelengths. We
examine ways in which the asymptotic kinetic energy of the explosion affects
both the predicted velocity and velocity gradient in the Si II and Ca II lines.
Models with an asymmetric distribution of 56Ni are found to result in a larger

possible application of such automatons to detect and control cancer cells in
the human body are greatly focused MRI and PET scans finds the affected regions
at the tissue level even as we can find the affected regions at the cellular
level using the framework. The AIA may be designed to ensure optimum
utilization as they record and might control the presence of affected cells in
a human body. The proposed models and techniques can be generalized and used in
any application where cells are injured or affected by some disease or
accident. The best method to import AIA into the body without surgery or
injection is to insert small pill like automata, carrying material viz drugs or
leukocytes that is needed to correct the infection. In this process, the AIA
can be compared to nano pills to deliver or support therapy. NanoHive
simulation software was used to validate the framework of this paper. The
existing nanomedicine models such as obstacle avoidance algorithm based models
(Hla K H S et al 2008) and the framework in this model were tested in different
simulation based experiments. The existing models such as obstacle avoidance
based models failed in complex environmental conditions (such as changing
environmental conditions, presence of semi-solid particles, etc) while the
model in this paper executed its framework successfully.Come systems biology,
this field of automatons deserves a bigger leap of understanding especially

of an unconstrained simulation with a sixty times larger volume to calibrate
the influence of cosmic variance. We characterize the Mass Aggregation History
(MAH) for each halo by three characteristic times, the formation, assembly and
last major merger times. A major merger is defined by a minimal mass ratio of
10:1. We find that the three LGs share a similar MAH with formation and last
major merger epochs placed on average \approx 10 - 12 Gyr ago. Between 12% and
17% of the halos in the mass range 5 x 10^11 Msol/h < M_h < 5 x 10^12 Msol/h
have a similar MAH. In a set of pairs of halos within the same mass range, a
fraction of 1% to 3% share similar formation properties as both halos in the
simulated LG. An unsolved question posed by our results is the dynamical origin
of the MAH of the LGs. The isolation criteria commonly used to define LG-like
halos in unconstrained simulations do not narrow down the halo population into
a set with quiet MAHs, nor does a further constraint to reside in a low density
environment. The quiet MAH of the LGs provides a favorable environment for the
formation of disk galaxies like the Milky Way and M31. The timing for the
beginning of the last major merger in the Milky Way dark matter halo matches
with the gas rich merger origin for the thick component in the galactic disk.
Our results support the view that the specific large and mid scale environment
around the Local Group play a critical role in shaping its MAH and hence its
baryonic structure at present.

the score+search paradigm, the dominant approach uses local search methods in
the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the usual choices for
defining the elementary modifications (local changes) that can be applied are
arc addition, arc deletion, and arc reversal. In this paper, we propose a new
local search method that uses a different search space, and which takes account
of the concept of equivalence between network structures: restricted acyclic
partially directed graphs (RPDAGs). In this way, the number of different
configurations of the search space is reduced, thus improving efficiency.
Moreover, although the final result must necessarily be a local optimum given
the nature of the search method, the topology of the new search space, which
avoids making early decisions about the directions of the arcs, may help to
find better local optima than those obtained by searching in the DAG space.
Detailed results of the evaluation of the proposed search method on several

increased in the past years. As a result, it is harder to guarantee their
correct behavior. One of the most successful methods for automated verification
of finite-state systems is model checking. Most of the current model-checking
systems use binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for the representation of the
tested model and in the verification process of its properties. Generally, BDDs
allow a canonical compact representation of a boolean function (given an order
of its variables). The more compact the BDD is, the better performance one gets
from the verifier. However, finding an optimal order for a BDD is an
NP-complete problem. Therefore, several heuristic methods based on expert
knowledge have been developed for variable ordering. We propose an alternative
approach in which the variable ordering algorithm gains 'ordering experience'
from training models and uses the learned knowledge for finding good orders.
Our methodology is based on offline learning of pair precedence classifiers
from training models, that is, learning which variable pair permutation is more
likely to lead to a good order. For each training model, a number of training
sequences are evaluated. Every training model variable pair permutation is then
tagged based on its performance on the evaluated orders. The tagged
permutations are then passed through a feature extractor and are given as
examples to a classifier creation algorithm. Given a model for which an order
is requested, the ordering algorithm consults each precedence classifier and
constructs a pair precedence table which is used to create the order. Our
algorithm was integrated with SMV, which is one of the most widely used
verification systems. Preliminary empirical evaluation of our methodology,
using real benchmark models, shows performance that is better than random
ordering and is competitive with existing algorithms that use expert knowledge.
We believe that in sub-domains of models (alu, caches, etc.) our system will
prove even more valuable. This is because it features the ability to learn
sub-domain knowledge, something that no other ordering algorithm does.

system over the resources produced along the chain. In a competitive
equilibrium for this system, agents choose locally optimal allocations with
respect to prices, and outcomes are optimal overall. To determine prices, we
define a market protocol based on distributed, progressive auctions, and
myopic, non-strategic agent bidding policies. In the presence of resource
contention, this protocol produces better solutions than the greedy protocols
common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature. The
protocol often converges to high-value supply chains, and when competitive
equilibria exist, typically to approximate competitive equilibria. However,
complementarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to
wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their outputs. A
subsequent decommitment phase recovers a significant fraction of the lost

The interested party cannot design a new game, cannot enforce agents' behavior,
cannot enforce payments by the agents, and cannot prohibit strategies available
to the agents. However, he can influence the outcome of the game by committing
to non-negative monetary transfers for the different strategy profiles that may
be selected by the agents. The interested party assumes that agents are
rational in the commonly agreed sense that they do not use dominated
strategies. Hence, a certain subset of outcomes is implemented in a given game
if by adding non-negative payments, rational players will necessarily produce
an outcome in this subset. Obviously, by making sufficiently big payments one
can implement any desirable outcome. The question is what is the cost of
implementation? In this paper we introduce the notion of k-implementation of a
desired set of strategy profiles, where k stands for the amount of payment that
need to be actually made in order to implement desirable outcomes. A major
point in k-implementation is that monetary offers need not necessarily
materialize when following desired behaviors. We define and study
k-implementation in the contexts of games with complete and incomplete
information. In the latter case we mainly focus on the VCG games. Our setting
is later extended to deal with mixed strategies using correlation devices.
Together, the paper introduces and studies the implementation of desirable
outcomes by a reliable party who cannot modify game rules (i.e. provide

variables given evidence. MAP has always been perceived to be significantly
harder than the related problems of computing the probability of a variable
instantiation Pr, or the problem of computing the most probable explanation
(MPE). This paper investigates the complexity of MAP in Bayesian networks.
Specifically, we show that MAP is complete for NP^PP and provide further
negative complexity results for algorithms based on variable elimination. We
also show that MAP remains hard even when MPE and Pr become easy. For example,
we show that MAP is NP-complete when the networks are restricted to polytrees,
and even then can not be effectively approximated. Given the difficulty of
computing MAP exactly, and the difficulty of approximating MAP while providing
useful guarantees on the resulting approximation, we investigate best effort
approximations. We introduce a generic MAP approximation framework. We provide
two instantiations of the framework; one for networks which are amenable to
exact inference Pr, and one for networks for which even exact inference is too
hard. This allows MAP approximation on networks that are too complex to even
exactly solve the easier problems, Pr and MPE. Experimental results indicate
that using these approximation algorithms provides much better solutions than
standard techniques, and provide accurate MAP estimates in many cases.

commitment heuristic search planner based on a flexible object-oriented
workbench architecture. Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic
directed exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed
estimates and associated data structures. MIPS has shown distinguished
performance in the last two international planning competitions. In the last
event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to
include numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective
functions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped
schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition,
MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track and every benchmark
domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article
introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were
necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems
and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical
path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal
parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses
known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect
to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of
this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each
encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is
scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds
and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers
knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain
object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been
developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with
admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the
competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made,
including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration
according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.

be strongly influenced by the rubber market as well as by the truck market. In
this paper we design protocols for exchange of information between a sequence

markets to function separately, while the information exchanged ensures
efficient global behavior across the supply chain. Each market that forms a
link in the supply chain operates as a double auction, where the bids on one

the industry, and the bids on the other side are synthetically generated by the
protocol to express the combined information from all other links in the chain.
The double auctions in each of the markets can be of several types, and we
study several variants of incentive compatible double auctions, comparing them

groundbreaking work in this area draws on notable results from game theory, in

equilibrium obviously rely on their existence. Learners that instead seek to
play optimally with respect to the other players also depend upon equilibria
since equilibria are fixed points for learning. From another perspective,
agents with limitations are real and common. These may be undesired physical
limitations as well as self-imposed rational limitations, such as abstraction
and approximation techniques, used to make learning tractable. This article
explores the interactions of these two important concepts: equilibria and
limitations in learning. We introduce the question of whether equilibria
continue to exist when agents have limitations. We look at the general effects
limitations can have on agent behavior, and define a natural extension of
equilibria that accounts for these limitations. Using this formalization, we
make three major contributions: (i) a counterexample for the general existence
of equilibria with limitations, (ii) sufficient conditions on limitations that
preserve their existence, (iii) three general classes of games and limitations
that satisfy these conditions. We then present empirical results from a

that A* would expand and returns the shortest path between the two points.
However, due to the physical nature of the problem, the complexity of the

resolution, which are already known to be much stronger than ordinary DPLL. We
also show that a slight variant of CL with unlimited restarts is as powerful as
RES itself. Translating these analytical results to practice, however, presents
a challenge because of the nondeterministic nature of clause learning
algorithms. We propose a novel way of exploiting the underlying problem
structure, in the form of a high level problem description such as a graph or
PDDL specification, to guide clause learning algorithms toward faster
solutions. We show that this leads to exponential speed-ups on grid and
randomized pebbling problems, as well as substantial improvements on certain

arguments, followed by the selection of the most acceptable of them (for

framework proposed by Dung in 1995, our purpose is to introduce 'graduality' in
the selection of the best arguments, i.e., to be able to partition the set of
the arguments in more than the two usual subsets of 'selected' and
'non-selected' arguments in order to represent different levels of selection.
Our basic idea is that an argument is all the more acceptable if it can be
preferred to its attackers. First, we discuss general principles underlying a
'gradual' valuation of arguments based on their interactions. Following these
principles, we define several valuation models for an abstract argumentation
system. Then, we introduce 'graduality' in the concept of acceptability of
arguments. We propose new acceptability classes and a refinement of existing
classes taking advantage of an available 'gradual' valuation.

at the outset to be an easier task than induction, there have not been many
provably useful algorithms for transduction. Moreover, the precise relation
between induction and transduction has not yet been determined. The main
theoretical developments related to transduction were presented by Vapnik more
than twenty years ago. One of Vapnik's basic results is a rather tight error
bound for transductive classification based on an exact computation of the
hypergeometric tail. While tight, this bound is given implicitly via a
computational routine. Our first contribution is a somewhat looser but explicit
characterization of a slightly extended PAC-Bayesian version of Vapnik's
transductive bound. This characterization is obtained using concentration
inequalities for the tail of sums of random variables obtained by sampling
without replacement. We then derive error bounds for compression schemes such
as (transductive) support vector machines and for transduction algorithms based
on clustering. The main observation used for deriving these new error bounds
and algorithms is that the unlabeled test points, which in the transductive

dependent prior distributions over the hypothesis space.

group of decision makers that share a single global objective. The difficulty
in solving optimally such problems arises when the agents lack full
observability of the global state of the system when they operate. The general
problem has been shown to be NEXP-complete. In this paper, we identify classes
of decentralized control problems whose complexity ranges between NEXP and P.
In particular, we study problems characterized by independent transitions,
independent observations, and goal-oriented objective functions. Two algorithms
are shown to solve optimally useful classes of goal-oriented decentralized
processes in polynomial time. This paper also studies information sharing among
the decision-makers, which can improve their performance. We distinguish
between three ways in which agents can exchange information: indirect
communication, direct communication and sharing state features that are not
controlled by the agents. Our analysis shows that for every class of problems
we consider, introducing direct or indirect communication does not change the
worst-case complexity. The results provide a better understanding of the
complexity of decentralized control problems that arise in practice and
facilitate the development of planning algorithms for these problems.

to this case if strong assumptions are made on the characteristics of the
environment in which the learning is performed, so that the relevant sensor
readings and motor commands can be readily identified. The introduction of such
assumptions leads to strongly-biased learning systems that can eventually lose
the generality of traditional reinforcement-learning algorithms. In this line,
we observe that, in realistic situations, the reward received by the robot
depends only on a reduced subset of all the executed actions and that only a
reduced subset of the sensor inputs (possibly different in each situation and
for each action) are relevant to predict the reward. We formalize this property
in the so called 'categorizability assumption' and we present an algorithm that
takes advantage of the categorizability of the environment, allowing a decrease
in the learning time with respect to existing reinforcement-learning
algorithms. Results of the application of the algorithm to a couple of
simulated realistic-robotic problems (landmark-based navigation and the
six-legged robot gait generation) are reported to validate our approach and to

subproblems can be added together without overestimating the cost of solving
the original problem. Previously, we showed how to statically partition the
sliding-tile puzzles into disjoint groups of tiles to compute an admissible

present another method for additive heuristics which we call dynamically

Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are generally considered to be
intractable for large models. The intractability of these algorithms is to a
large extent a consequence of computing an exact, optimal policy over the
entire belief space. However, in real-world POMDP problems, computing the
optimal policy for the full belief space is often unnecessary for good control
even for problems with complicated policy classes. The beliefs experienced by
the controller often lie near a structured, low-dimensional subspace embedded
in the high-dimensional belief space. Finding a good approximation to the
optimal value function for only this subspace can be much easier than computing
the full value function. We introduce a new method for solving large-scale
POMDPs by reducing the dimensionality of the belief space. We use Exponential
family Principal Components Analysis (Collins, Dasgupta and Schapire, 2002) to
represent sparse, high-dimensional belief spaces using small sets of learned
features of the belief state. We then plan only in terms of the low-dimensional
belief features. By planning in this low-dimensional space, we can find
policies for POMDP models that are orders of magnitude larger than models that
can be handled by conventional techniques. We demonstrate the use of this
algorithm on a synthetic problem and on mobile robot navigation tasks.

addition, we show that the average computational cost of the well-known
branch-and-bound subtour elimination algorithm for the problem also exhibits a
thrashing behavior, transitioning from easy to difficult as the distance

use of typed lambda-calculus with inductive types. In this paper we present
solutions to cope with single pushout construction for the graph structure and
the computations functions. As this rewrite system uses inductive types, the
expressiveness of attribute computations is facilitated and appears more
efficient than the one based on Sigma-algebras. Some examples showing the
interest of our computation approach are described in this paper.

disk change near R = 8 kpc. Within this radius the star formation rate (SFR)
has been constant with time during at least the past 250 Myr, while at larger
radii the SFR has declined during this same time period. That the recent SFR in
the inner disk has been constant suggests that M33 has evolved in isolation for
at least the past ~ 0.5 Gyr, thereby providing a constraint on the timing of
any recent interaction with M31. The fractional contribution that young stars
make to the total mass of the stellar disk changes with radius, peaking near 8
kpc. Evidence is also presented that the SFR during the past 100 Myr in the
southern half of the galaxy has been ~ 0.4 dex higher than in the northern
half. Finally, structures with sizes spanning many kpc that contain blue
objects - presumably main sequence stars that formed during intermediate epochs
- are identified near the disk boundary. It is argued that these are tidal
features that were pulled from the main body of M33 and - in some cases - are
the fossil remnants of star formation that occured in an extended disk during

adjusting the UAV heading in order to maximize a lower bound on the ergodic sum
rate of the uplink channel, using a Kalman filter to track the positions of the
mobile ground nodes. Fairness among the users can be guaranteed through
weighting the bound for each user's ergodic rate with a factor inversely
proportional to their average data rate. For the common scenario where a high

to a finite-mean lifetime: in this case, local extinction of the population is

in the classical regime, he uses peculiar estimates (number of photons per
cubic wavelength) that overstate the circumstance by more than 20 factors of
ten. He misunderstands the operation of optical tweezers and ignores their
significant thermal effects. He credulously accepts poorly supported claims of
non-thermal effects. He mistakenly believes that kBT is the average thermal
energy (per cubic wavelength or per cell) in materials. It is not. It is twice
the average energy per molecule per degree of freedom in the material. The
thermal energy density is (1/2)kBT X (average number of degrees of freedom of
the molecules) X (Avogadro's number). (Avogadro's number is 6 X 1026
molecules/mole.) Thus, Bruno's proposed safety thresholds are more than 1025
too low. Using the correct value for the average thermal energy would place the
thresholds close to today's standards. Throughout his analysis he neglects the
index of refraction of living tissue, n \cong 9, or the absorption length,
{\alpha} \cong 1 cm-1, in the microwave region.

monolayer between hydrophobic walls at partial hydration, with a wall-to-wall
distance of about 0.5 nm. We analyze how the diffusion constant parallel to the
walls, $D_{\parallel}$, changes and correlates to the phase diagram of the
system. We find a locus of $D_{\parallel}$ maxima and a locus of
$D_{\parallel}$ minima along isotherms, with lines of constant $D_{\parallel}$
resembling the melting line of bulk water. The two loci of $D_{\parallel}$
extrema envelope the line of temperatures of density maxima at constant $P$. We
show how these loci are related to the anomalous volume behavior due to the
hydrogen bonds. At much lower $T$, confined water becomes subdiffusive, and we
discuss how this behavior is a consequence of the increased correlations among
water molecules when the hydrogen bond network develops. Within the
subdiffusive region, although translations are largely hampered, we observe
that the hydrogen bond network can equilibrate and its rearrangement is
responsible for the appearance of density minima along isobars. We clarify that
the minima are not necessarily related to the saturation of the hydrogen bond
network.

result reduces to the exact result of Allahverdyan et al, with the average
number of unzipped base pairs going as <X>~1/f^2 in the white noise limit,

correlated noise, where the integrated autocorrelation is divergent, we find
that <X> is finite at f=0, with its value decreasing as the correlations become

DNA sequence against unzipping. Our result is also in agreement with the
findings of Allahverdyan et al, obtained using numerical generation of the long

Cross-correlation analysis for NGC 3783 suggests that some disc near-IR
emission is present in the J-band flux, while the H and K-bands are dominated
by emission from a torus located at the dust sublimation radius. For MR2251-178
the cross-correlation analysis and the optical-near-IR flux-flux plots suggest
that the near-IR flux is dominated by disc emission. We model the optical to

models, the vacuum-dipole model, which ignores the magnetosphere but includes
the inductive electric field due to the obliquely rotating magnetic dipole, and
the corotating-magnetosphere model, which neglects the vacuum inductive
electric field and assumes a corotating magnetosphere. We argue that the
inductive field can be neglected only if it is screened by a current, ${\bi
J}_{\rm sc}$, which we calculate for a rigidly rotating magnetosphere.
Screening of the parallel component of the inductive field can be effective,
but the perpendicular component cannot be screened in a pulsar magnetosphere.
The incompletely screened inductive electric field has not been included in any
model for a pulsar magnetosphere, and taking it into account has important
implications. One effect is that it implies that the magnetosphere cannot be
corotating, and we suggest that drift relative to corotation offers a natural
explanation for the drifting of subpulses. A second effect is that this
screening of the parallel inductive electric field must break down in the outer
magnetosphere, and this offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of
the electrons that produce pulsed gamma-ray emission.

research of another olivine structured material LiMnPO4 due to its higher
operating potential voltage and energy density. However, high rate performance
for LiMnPO4-based cathode materials has been challenging due to its extremely
low electrical and ionic conductivities. Here, we develop a synthesis of
Fe-doped LiMnPO4 (LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4) nanorods directly bonded on graphene
sheets (reduced from graphene oxide) to render LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4 nanorods
superior electrical conductivity. The LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4 nanorod morphology is
unique to materials grown on graphene over those grown in free solution, and is
ideal for fast Li+ diffusion with the diffusion path of [010] crystallographic
axis along the short radial direction (~20-30nm) of the nanorods. These
together lead to ultrafast discharge within ~30-40 seconds without using a high
carbon content. With high columbic efficiency above 99.5% at a high operating
voltage, our LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4 nanorods/graphene hybrid exhibits the best rate
performance among all doped LiMnPO4 cathode materials for Lithium ion

applications are actively being researched upon. Almost all these applications
need bipartite graphs of the order of tens of thousands in practice, whose
nodes represent parallel computations. To reduce its implementation cost,
reducing amount of system/hardware resources during design is an important
engineering objective. In this context, we present a scheme to reduce resource
utilization when performing computations derived from PG-based graphs. In a
fully parallel design based on PG concepts, the number of processing units is
equal to the number of vertices, each performing an atomic computation. To
reduce the number of processing units used for implementation, we present an
easy way of partitioning the vertex set. Each block of partition is then
assigned to a processing unit. A processing unit performs the computations
corresponding to the vertices in the block assigned to it in a sequential
fashion, thus creating the effect of folding the overall computation. These
blocks have certain symmetric properties that enable us to develop a
conflict-free schedule. The scheme achieves the best possible throughput, in
lack of any overhead of shuffling data across memories while scheduling another
computation on the same processing unit. This paper reports two folding
schemes, which are based on same lattice embedding approach, based on
partitioning. We first provide a scheme for a projective space of dimension
five, and the corresponding schedules. Both the folding schemes that we present
have been verified by both simulation and hardware prototyping for different
applications. We later generalize this scheme to arbitrary projective spaces.

developed a time-dependent theory that allows us to specify any input
single-photon wavepacket guided by the waveguide as initial condition, and
calculate the excitation probability of the emitter, as well as the time
evolution of the transmitted and reflected field. For single-photon wavepackets
with a gaussian spectrum and temporal shape, we obtain analytical solutions for
the dynamics of absorption, with maximum atomic excitation $\thicksim 40%$. We
furthermore propose a terminated waveguide to aid the single-photon absorption.
We find that for an emitter placed at an optimal distance from the termination,
the maximum atomic excitation due to an incident single-photon wavepacket can
exceed 70%. This high value is a direct consequence of the high spontaneous
emission $\beta$-factor for emission into the waveguide. Finally, we have also
explored whether waveguide dispersion could aid single-photon absorption by
pulse shaping. For a gaussian input wavepacket, we find that the absorption
efficiency can be improved by a further 4% by engineering the dispersion.

simultaneous investigation of jet quenching and elliptic flow. The model
features inelastic 2 <-> 3 processes based on the Gunion-Bertsch matrix element
and has recently been extended to include light quark degrees of freedom,
allowing for direct comparison to hadronic data on the nuclear modification
factor via a fragmentation scheme for high-pT partons. The nuclear modification
factor of neutral pions in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energy is compared
to experimental data. Furthermore first results on the nuclear modification
factor and the integrated elliptic flow of charged hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions
at LHC are presented and compared to recent ALICE data. These investigations
are complemented by a study on the suppression of D-mesons at LHC based on
elastic interactions with the medium.

  Time-Series Databases",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A time series consists of a series of values or events obtained over repeated
measurements in time. Analysis of time series represents and important tool in
many application areas, such as stock market analysis, process and quality
control, observation of natural phenomena, medical treatments, etc. A vital
component in many types of time-series analysis is the choice of an appropriate
distance/similarity measure. Numerous measures have been proposed to date, with
the most successful ones based on dynamic programming. Being of quadratic time
complexity, however, global constraints are often employed to limit the search
space in the matrix during the dynamic programming procedure, in order to speed
up computation. Furthermore, it has been reported that such constrained
measures can also achieve better accuracy. In this paper, we investigate two
representative time-series distance/similarity measures based on dynamic
programming, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS),
and the effects of global constraints on them. Through extensive experiments on
a large number of time-series data sets, we demonstrate how global constrains
can significantly reduce the computation time of DTW and LCS. We also show
that, if the constraint parameter is tight enough (less than 10-15% of
time-series length), the constrained measure becomes significantly different
from its unconstrained counterpart, in the sense of producing qualitatively
different 1-nearest neighbor graphs. This observation explains the potential
for accuracy gains when using constrained measures, highlighting the need for
careful tuning of constraint parameters in order to achieve a good trade-off
between speed and accuracy.

blue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, we
investigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how the
red fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host mass
and the projected distance from their host. Comparing the red fraction of
satellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii,
we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass.
The satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample for
hosts with 11.0 < log M_* < 11.5, while the red fractions show no difference
for hosts with 10.0 < log M_* < 10.5. For the satellites of more massive hosts
the red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.
Our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of star
formation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.

and taking account of the redshift distribution of polarized background radio
sources against which the RM is measured, we simulate the sky map of the RM.
The contribution from galaxy clusters is subtracted from the map, based on
several different criteria of X-ray brightness and temperature. Our findings
are as follows. The distribution of RM for radio sources of different redshifts
shows that the root-mean-square (rms) value increases with redshift and
saturates for $z \ga 1$. The saturated value is RM$_{\rm rms} \approx$ several
${\rm rad m^{-2}}$. The probability distribution function of $|{\rm RM}|$
follows the lognormal distribution. The power spectrum has a broad plateau over
the angular scale of $\sim 1 - 0.1^\circ$ with a peak around $\sim 0.15^\circ$.
The second-order structure function has a flat profile in the angular
separation of $\ga 0.2^\circ$. Our results could provide useful insights for

at finite temperature in the pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. An action density
operator is correlated with three Polyakov loops representing the baryonic
state at a temperatures near the end of the QCD plateau, T/T_c = 0.8, and
another just before the deconfinement point, T/T_c = 0.9. The flux
distributions at short distance separations between the quarks display an
action-density profile consistent with a filled Delta shape iso-surface.
However the Delta-shaped action iso-surface distributions are found to persist
even at large inter-quark separations for both temperatures. The action density
distribution in the quark plane exhibits a nonuniform pattern for all quark
separations considered. This result contrasts the well-known Y-shaped uniform
action density gluonic-flux profile obtained using the Wilson-loop as a quark
source operator at zero temperature. We systematically measure and compare the
main aspects of the profile of the flux distribution at the two considered
temperature scales for three sets of isosceles triangle quark configurations.
The radii, amplitudes and rate of change of the width of the flux distribution
are found to reverse their behavior as the temperature increase from the end of
the QCD plateau region towards the deconfinement point. Remarkably, we find the
mean square width of the flux distribution shrinks and localizes for quark
separations larger than 1.0 fm at T/T_c = 0.8 which results in an identifiable
Y-shaped radius profile. Near the deconfinement point, the action-density
delocalizes and the width broadens linearly at large quark separations.

the solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by a two-dimensional
Wiener process whose diffusion vector fields do not commute. Our method is
simple and complementary to those of Gaines-Lyons and Wiktorsson, and amenable
to quasi-Monte--Carlo implementation. It is based on representing the Levy area
by an infinite weighted sum of independent Logistic random variables. We use
Chebychev polynomials to approximate the inverse distribution function of sums
of independent Logistic random variables in three characteristic regimes. The
error is controlled by the degree of the polynomials, we set the error to be
uniformly 10^(-12). We thus establish a strong almost-exact Levy area sampling
method. The complexity of our method is square logarithmic. We indicate how our

properties of the ISM, the nature of molecular clouds, and the global star
formation rate depend on the level of stellar feedback. We adopt a simple
physical model, which includes a galactic potential, a standard cooling and
heating prescription of the ISM, and self gravity of the gas. Stellar feedback
is implemented by injecting energy into dense, gravitationally collapsing gas,
but is independent of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. We obtain fractions of
gas, and filling factors for different phases of the ISM in reasonable ageement
with observations. Supernovae are found to be vital to reproduce the scale
heights of the different components of the ISM, and velocity dispersions. The
GMCs formed in the simulations display mass spectra similar to the
observations, their normalisation dependent on the level of feedback. We find
~40 per cent of the clouds exhibit retrograde rotation, induced by cloud-cloud
collisions. The star formation rates we obtain are in good agreement with the
observed Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, and are not strongly dependent on the star
formation efficiency we assume, being largely self regulated by the feedback.
We also investigate the effect of spiral structure by comparing calculations
with and without the spiral component of the potential. The main difference
with a spiral potential is that more massive GMCs are able to accumulate in the
spiral arms. Thus we are able to reproduce massive GMCs, and the spurs seen in
many grand design galaxies, even with stellar feedback. The presence of the
spiral potential does not have an explicit effect on the star formation rate,
but can increase the star formation rate indirectly by enabling the formation
of long-lived, strongly bound clouds.

point-like Dirac particles which can interact with the Dirac electron can be
observed, such as in the Standard Model. We emphasize that the existing world
of the Standard Model is a Dirac world satisfying the Dirac similarity
principle and believe that the immediate extension of the Standard Model will
remain to be so. On the other hand, we are looking for Higgs particles for the
last forty years but something is yet to be found. This leads naturally to the
""minimum Higgs hypotheses"".
  Now we know firmly that neutrinos have tiny masses, but in the minimal
Standard Model there is no natural sources for such tiny masses. If nothing
else, this could be taken as the clue as the signature of the existence of the
extra heavy $Z^{\prime 0}$ since it requires the extra Higgs field, that would
help in generating the neutrino tiny masses. Alternatively, we may have missed
the right-hand sector for some reason. A simplified version of the left-right
symmetric electroweak model has the simplest Higgs sector (in which there is
one standard left-hand Higgs doublet together with the image right-handed Higgs
doublet), of which the Higgs sector also satisfies the ""minimum Higgs
hypothesis"". Or, if we question the origin of the family symmetry, we may
consider to enlarge it to the family gauge symmetry. It transpires very feeble
family interactions. All the above possibilities satisfy both the so-called
""Dirac similarity principle"", the ""minimum Higgs hypothesis"", and
renormalizability.

holds with exactly the same exponents of the annealed case, so that we can
conclude that heterogeneous mean-field theory works for the contact process on

by applying a bias to the leads and its nonequilibrium dynamics is determined

compared to benchmark results obtained with the time-dependent density matrix

overestimation of the lead densities which indicates that the exchange

recently experienced a decline in its traditional activities, leading banks to
diversify into new business strategies. This paper examines whether the
observed shift into non-interest based activities improves financial
performance. Using a sample of 714 banks across 14 East-Asian and
Latin-American countries over the post 1997-crisis changing structure, we find
that diversification gains are more than offset by the cost of increased
exposure to the non-interest income, specifically by the trading income
volatility. But this diversification performance's effect is found to be no
linear with risk, and significantly not uniform among banks and across business
lines. An implication of these findings is that banking institutions can reap
diversification benefits as long as they well-studied it depending on their
specific characteristics, competences and risk levels, and as they choose the
right niche.

a pseudo-spin ${\cal S}=N/2$ allowing to formulate a Haldane conjecture: for
attractive interactions, we establish the emergence of Haldane insulating
phases when $N$ is even, whereas a metallic behavior is found when $N$ is odd.
We point out that the $N=1,2$ cases do \emph{not} have the generic properties
of each family. The metallic phase for $N$ odd and larger than 1 has a
quasi-long range singlet pairing ordering with an interesting edge-state
structure. Moreover, the properties of the Haldane insulating phases with even
$N$ further depend on the parity of N/2. In this respect, within the low-energy
approach, we argue that the Haldane phases with N/2 even are not topologically
protected but equivalent to a topologically trivial insulating phase and thus
confirm the recent conjecture put forward by Pollmann {\it et al.} [Pollmann

is still elusive in optical systems due to the very demanding requirements of
its experimental implementation. This typically requires very fast changes of
the boundary conditions of the problem, such as the high-frequency driving of
the positions of the mirrors of a cavity accommodating the field. Here, we show
that an ensemble of two-level atoms collectively coupled to the electromagnetic

at low frequencies and close to a quantum phase transition, stimulates the
production of photons from the vacuum. This paves the way to an effective
simulation of the DCE through a mechanism that has recently found an
outstanding experimental demonstration\cite{esslinger}. The spectral properties
of the emitted radiation reflect the critical nature of the system and allow us
to link the detection of DCE to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for the production
of defects when crossing a continuous phase transition\cite{KZ1,KZ2}. We

of SAX J1808.4-3658 a major pulse profile change was accompanied by a dramatic
variation of the disc luminosity at almost constant total luminosity. We argue
that this phenomenon is related to a change in the coupling between the neutron
star magnetic field and the accretion disc. The varying size of the pulsar
magnetosphere can influence the accretion curtain geometry and affect the shape
and the size of the hotspots. Using this physical picture, we develop a
self-consistent model that successfully describes simultaneously the pulse
profile variation as well as the spectral transition. Our findings are
particularly important for testing the theories of accretion onto magnetized
neutron stars, better understanding of the accretion geometry as well as the
physics of disc-magnetosphere coupling. The identification that varying hotspot
size can lead to pulse profile changes has profound implications for
determination of the neutron star masses and radii.

between the trapped ions, and are mediated by motion which can be driven by
state-dependent forces. The precise forms of the trapping potentials and the
interactions are derived in the presence of a surface electrode and a cover
electrode. These results are the starting point to derive an optimized
surface-electrode geometry for trapping ions in the desired honeycomb lattice

allows for coupling all three bond types of the model simultaneously, without
the need for time discretization. Finally we propose a simple wire structure

Wan we know that there exist many finite fields for which the values of the
Kloosterman sums are distinct except Frobenius conjugation. For these fields we

Collecting mission. The optimization problem is intrinsically hard since it
mixes combinatorial optimization to select the debris among a list of
candidates and functional optimization to define the orbital maneuvers. The
solving methodology proceeds in two steps : firstly a generic transfer strategy
with impulsive maneuvers is defined so that the problem becomes of finite
dimension, secondly the problem is linearized around an initial reference
solution. A Branch and Bound algorithm is then applied to optimize
simultaneously the debris selection and the orbital maneuvers, yielding a new
reference solution. The process is iterated until the solution stabilizes on
the optimal path. The trajectory controls and dates are finally re-optimized in
order to refine the solution. The method is applicable whatever the numbers of
debris (candidate and to deorbit) and whatever the mission duration. It is
exemplified on an application case consisting in selecting 5 SSO debris among a

(HEG). The sample consists of 29 observations of 10 unique sources. We present
measurements of the Fe Ka line parameters with the highest spectral resolution
currently available. In particular, we derive the most robust intrinsic line
widths for some of the sources in the sample to date. We obtained a weighted
mean FWHM of 2000 \pm 160 km/s for 8 out of 10 sources (the remaining sources
had insufficient signal-to-noise). From a comparison with the optical
emission-line widths obtained from spectropolarimetric observations, we found
that the location of Fe Ka line-emitting material is a factor of ~0.7-11 times
the size of the optical BLR. Furthermore, compared to 13 type I AGNs for which
the best Fe Ka line FWHM constraints were obtained, we found no difference in
the FWHM distribution or the mean FWHM, and this conclusion is independent of
the central black hole mass. This result suggests that the bulk of the Fe Ka
line emission may originate from a universal region at the same radius with
respect to the gravitational radius, ~30,000 Rg on average. By examining the
correlation between the Fe Ka luminosity and the [O IV] line luminosity, we
found a marginal difference in the Fe K line flux between type I and type II
AGNs, but the spread in the ratio of L(Fe) to L([O IV]) is about two orders of
magnitude. Our results confirm the theoretical expectation that the Fe Ka
emission-line luminosity cannot trivially be used as a proxy of the intrinsic

18.71 and 10.51 mum, respectively, and a map of the AGN narrow-line region
tracer [Ne V] at 14.32 mum. We also mapped the S(1), S(2) and S(3) pure
rotational lines of H2, which trace the distribution of warm molecular
hydrogen. We obtained an extinction map (A_V) based on the apparent strength of
the 9.7 mum silicate absorption feature. Our A_V map traces the contours of the
starburst ring but the highest extinction (A_V(9.85 mum)~60) is found at the
nucleus. Within the uncertainty of the astrometry all emission lines are found
to peak on the nucleus, except for the warm molecular hydrogen emission which
shows a maximum 60-100 pc NW of the nucleus. We favour a scenario in which the
lower H2 0-0 S(1) and S(2) rotational lines originate mainly from an unobscured
extra-nuclear component associated with the super-wind cone observed in the HST
NICMOS map of the H2 1-0 S(1) vibrational line. For the [Ne V] emission we
infer an attenuation of a factor 12-160 (A_V=55-112) based on a comparison of
the ratio of our [Ne V] flux and the absorption-corrected 14-195 keV Swift-BAT
flux to the average [Ne V]/BAT ratio for Seyfert 1 nuclei. The high attenuation
indicates that [Ne V] and [O IV] cannot be used as extinction-free tracers of

users is how to resolve the contention that arises when all of them must use
it, but the resource allows only for one user each time. The application of
efficient solutions for this problem spans a myriad of settings such as radio
communication networks or databases. For the case where the number of users is
unknown, recent work has yielded fruitful results for local area networks and
radio networks, although either a (possibly loose) upper bound on the number of
users needs to be known, or the solution is suboptimal, or it is only implicit
or embedded in other problems, with bounds proved only asymptotically. In this
paper, under the assumption that collision detection or information on the
number of contenders is not available, we present a novel protocol for
contention resolution in radio networks, and we recreate a protocol previously
used for other problems, tailoring the constants for our needs. In contrast
with previous work, both protocols are proved to be optimal up to a small
constant factor and with high probability for big enough number of contenders.
Additionally, the protocols are evaluated and contrasted with the previous work
by extensive simulations. The evaluation shows that the complexity bounds
obtained by the analysis are rather tight, and that both protocols proposed
have small and predictable complexity for many system sizes (unlike previous
proposals).

this artifact is removed by using the evolution equation for the magnetic
helicity of the total field in the shearing--advective gauge. In the
traditional dynamical alpha quenching formalism, this can be described as an
additional magnetic helicity flux of small-scale fields that does not appear in

assumption that the Z_b(10610) and Z_b(10650) are B\bar B^*+{\rm c.c.} and
B^*\bar B^* bound states, respectively, with very small binding energies is
consistent with the data. The calculation is based on a power counting for
bottom meson loops, which is explicitly given up to two-loop in the framework
of a nonrelativistic effective field theory. We also show that if the Z_b
states are of molecular nature, then the data should not be analyzed by using a
Breit-Wigner parametrization.

Co7(TeO3)4Br6, was studied by ac susceptibility and the related techniques.
Very large Arrhenius activation energy of 17.2 meV (201 K) and long attempt
time (2x10^(-4)s) span the full spectrum of magnetic dynamics inside a
convenient frequency window, offering a rare opportunity for general studies of
magnetic dynamics. Within the experimental window the ac susceptibility data
build almost ideally semicircular Cole-Cole plots. Comprehensive study of
experimental dynamic hysteresis loops of the compound is presented and
interpreted within a simple thermal-activation-assisted spin lattice relaxation
model for spin reversal. Quantitative agreement between the experimental
results and the model's prediction for dynamic coercive field is achieved by
assuming the central physical quantity, the Debye relaxation rate, to depend on
frequency, as well as on the applied field strength and sample temperature.
Cross-over between minor- to major hysteresis loops is carefully analyzed.
Low-frequency limitations of the model, relying on domain wall pinning effects,
are experimentally detected and appropriately discussed.

Langevin equation, based on a picture of multiple uncorrelated random
collisions with the medium. Heavy-quark transport coefficients are evaluated
within a pQCD approach, with a proper HTL resummation of medium effects for
soft scatterings. The Langevin equation is embedded in a multi-step setup
developed to study heavy-flavor observables in pp and AA collisions, starting
from a NLO pQCD calculation of initial heavy-quark yields, complemented in the
nuclear case by shadowing corrections, k_T-broadening and nuclear geometry
effects. Then, only for AA collisions, the Langevin equation is solved
numerically in a background medium described by relativistic hydrodynamics.
Finally, the propagated heavy quarks are made hadronize and decay into
electrons. Results for the nuclear modification factor R_AA of heavy-flavor
hadrons and electrons from their semi-leptonic decays are provided, both for
RHIC and LHC beam energies.

(second-order) mean-field-like phase transition occurring at 17.5 K in URu2Si2.
About ten years ago, the term hidden order (HO) was coined and has since been
utilized to describe the unknown ordered state, whose origin cannot be
disclosed by conventional solid-state probes, such as x rays, neutrons, or
muons. HO is able to support superconductivity at lower temperatures (Tc ~ 1.5
K), and when magnetism is developed with increasing pressure both the HO and
the superconductivity are destroyed. Other ways of probing the HO are via
Rh-doping and very large magnetic fields. During the last few years a variety
of advanced techniques have been tested to probe the HO state and their
attempts will be summarized. A digest of recent theoretical developments is
also included. It is the objective of this Colloquium to shed additional light
on the HO state and its associated phases in other materials.

unique properties under time evolution. Here we explore this concept for
one-dimensional repulsive nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations, which describe
weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or light propagation in a
nonlinear medium. It is shown that the dynamics of phase-space translations of
the ground state of a harmonic potential is quite simple: the centre follows a
classical trajectory whereas its shape does not vary in time. The parabolic
potential is the only one that satisfies this property. We study the time
evolution of these nonlinear coherent states under perturbations of their
shape, or of the confining potential. A rich variety of effects emerges. In
particular, in the presence of anharmonicities, we observe that the packet
splits into two distinct components. A fraction of the condensate is
transferred towards uncoherent high-energy modes, while the amplitude of
oscillation of the remaining coherent component is damped towards the bottom of
the well.

accretion and molecular outflows towards a selected sample of high-mass
star-forming regions that show evidence of infall and rotation from previous
studies. Aims. We wish to make a thorough study at high-angular resolution of
the structure and kinematics of the HMCs and corresponding molecular outflows
in the high-mass star-forming region G24.78+0.08. Methods. We carried out SMA
and IRAM PdBI observations at 1.3 and 1.4 mm, respectively, of dust and of
typical high-density and molecular outflow tracers with resolutions of <1"".
Complementary IRAM 30-m 12CO and 13CO observations were carried out to recover
the short spacing information of the molecular outflows. Results. The
millimeter continuum emission towards cores G24 A1 and A2 has been resolved
into 3 and 2 cores, respectively, and named A1, A1b, A1c, A2, and A2b. All
these cores are aligned in a southeast-northwest direction coincident with that
of the molecular outflows detected in the region, which suggests a preferential
direction for star formation in this region. The masses of the cores range from
7 to 22 Msun, and the rotational temperatures from 128 to 180 K. The
high-density tracers have revealed the existence of 2 velocity components
towards A1, one of them peaks close to the position of the millimeter continuum
peak and of the HC HII region, and is associated with the velocity gradient
seen in CH3CN towards this core, while the other one peaks southwest of core A1
and is not associated with any millimeter continuum emission peak. The
position-velocity plots along outflow A and the 13CO averaged blueshifted and
redshifted emission indicate that this outflow is driven by core A2.

feature-based approaches, we provide a syntax to describe segmented regions as
basic objects and complex objects as compositions of basic ones. Then we
introduce a companion extensional semantics for defining reasoning services,
such as retrieval, classification, and subsumption. These services can be used
for both exact and approximate matching, using similarity measures. Using our
logical approach as a formal specification, we implemented a complete
client-server image retrieval system, which allows a user to pose both queries
by sketch and queries by example. A set of experiments has been carried out on
a testbed of images to assess the retrieval capabilities of the system in
comparison with expert users ranking. Results are presented adopting a
well-established measure of quality borrowed from textual information
