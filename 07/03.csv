Chapter one describes all types of natural
class of intervals and the arithmetic operations on them. Chapter two
introduces the semigroup of natural class of intervals using R or Zn and study
the properties associated with them. Chapter three studies the notion of rings
constructed using the natural class of intervals. Matrix theory using the
special class of intervals is analyzed in chapter four of this book. Chapter
five deals with polynomials using interval coefficients. New types of rings of
natural intervals are introduced and studied in chapter six. The notion of
vector space using natural class of intervals is built in chapter seven. In
chapter eight fuzzy natural class of intervals are introduced and algebraic
structures on them is built and described. Algebraic structures using natural
class of neutrosophic intervals are developed in chapter nine.Chapter ten
suggests some possible applications. The final chapter proposes over 200
problems of which some are at research level and some difficult and others are
simple.

online game. In their virtual life players use eight basic actions which allow
them to interact with each other. These actions are communication, trade,
establishing or breaking friendships and enmities, attack, and punishment. We
measure the probabilities for these actions conditional on previous taken and
received actions and find a dramatic increase of negative behavior immediately
after receiving negative actions. Similarly, positive behavior is intensified
by receiving positive actions. We observe a tendency towards anti-persistence
in communication sequences. Classifying actions as positive (good) and negative
(bad) allows us to define binary 'world lines' of lives of individuals.
Positive and negative actions are persistent and occur in clusters, indicated
by large scaling exponents alpha~0.87 of the mean square displacement of the
world lines. For all eight action types we find strong signs for high levels of
repetitiveness, especially for negative actions. We partition behavioral
sequences into segments of length n (behavioral `words' and 'motifs') and study
their statistical properties. We find two approximate power laws in the word
ranking distribution, one with an exponent of kappa-1 for the ranks up to 100,
and another with a lower exponent for higher ranks. The Shannon n-tuple
redundancy yields large values and increases in terms of word length, further
underscoring the non-trivial statistical properties of behavioral sequences. On
the collective, societal level the timeseries of particular actions per day can
be understood by a simple mean-reverting log-normal model.

We investigate whether these motions, in particular the upflows in the bright

existing instrumentation. We use a snapshot from a sunspot simulation to
calculate 2D maps of synthetic line profiles for the spectral lines Fe\sci
7090.4 \AA ~ and C\sci 5380.34 \AA. The maps are spatially and spectrally
degraded according to typical instrument properties. Line-of-sight velocities
are determined from line bisector shifts. We find that the detectability of the
convective flows is strongly affected by spatial smearing, particularly so for
the downflows. Furthermore, the line-of-sight velocities are dominated by the
Evershed flow unless the observation is made very near to disk center. These
problems may have compromised recent attempts to detect overturning penumbral
convection. Lines with a low formation height are best suited to detect the
convective flows.

an improvement. The Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares technique is
used to determine the best-fit parameters L1 and b. This model has the
advantages that L1 has the same units (length) independent of the value of the
exponent and has an easily interpreted physical meaning as the typical length
of a fish with one unit of weight. This proposed model is compared with the
traditional model on length-weight data sets for black crappie, largemouth
bass, chain pickerel, yellow perch, and brown bullhead obtained from Stilwell
Reservoir, West Point, New York. The resulting best-fit parameters, parameter
standard errors, and covariances are compared between the two models. The
average relative weight for these species is determined, along with typical
meat yields for four species. For the five species, using the logarithmic
approach and a linear least-squares, standard errors in the coefficient, a,
range from 60.2% to 136.5% for the traditional model. Using a non-linear least
squares technique to determine best fit parameters, the standard errors for the
coefficient, a, range from 68.5% to 164.0% in the traditional model. In the
improved model, standard errors in the parameter L1 range from 0.94% to 15.0%.
The covariance between a and b in the traditional model has a magnitude between
0.999 and 1.000 in both linear and non-linear parameter estimation methods. In
the improved model, the covariances between L1 and b are smaller. The improved
model, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, is preferable for weight vs. length in fish, because
the estimated parameter uncertainties and covariances are smaller in magnitude.
Furthermore, the parameters both have consistent units and an easily

characterized by an expanded lattice with superstructures due to Fe vacancy
ordering and ii) a non-magnetic phase with an in-plane compressed lattice. The
spatial distribution of the two phases at 300 K shows a frustrated or arrested

that analyze patches extracted from images or time series have led to

theoretical explanation for the above experimental observations. Our approach
relies on a detailed analysis of the commute time metric on prototypical graph
models that epitomize the geometry observed in general patch graphs. We prove
that a parametrization of the graph based on commute times shrinks the mutual
distances between patches that correspond to rapid local changes in the signal,
while the distances between patches that correspond to slow local changes
expand. In effect, our results explain why the parametrization of the set of
patches based on the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian can concentrate patches
that correspond to rapid local changes, which would otherwise be shattered in
the space of patches. While our results are based on a large sample analysis,
numerical experimentations on synthetic and real data indicate that the results
hold for datasets that are very small in practice.

In this paper we address the evolution of PPN/PN morphologies attempting to
understand if a transition from strongly bipolar to elliptical shape can be
driven by changes in the parameters of the mass loss process. To this end we
present 2.5D hydrodynamical simulations of mass loss at the end stages of
stellar evolution for intermediate mass stars. We track changes in wind
velocity, mass loss rate and mass loss geometry. In particular we focus on the
transition from mass loss dominated by a short duration jet flow (driven during
the PPN phase) to mass loss driven by a spherical fast wind (produced by the
central star of the PN). We address how such changes in outflow characteristics
can change the nebula from a bipolar to an elliptical morphology. Our results
show that including a period of jet formation in the temporal sequence of PPN
to PN produces realistic nebular synthetic emission geometries. More
importantly such a sequence provides insight, in principle, into the apparent
difference in morphology statistics characterizing PPN and PN systems. In
particular we find that while jet driven PPN can be expected to be dominated by
bipolar morphologies, systems that begin with a jet but are followed by a
spherical fast wind will evolve into elliptical nebulae. Furthermore, we find
that spherical nebulae are highly unlikely to ever derive from either bipolar
PPN or elliptical PN.

(MISO-IC) with interference decoding capability (IDC), so that the interference
signal can be decoded and subtracted from the received signal. On the MISO-IC
with single user decoding, transmit beamforming vectors are classically
designed to reach a compromise between mitigating the generated interference
(zero forcing of the interference) or maximizing the energy at the desired
user. The particularly intriguing problem arising in the multi-antenna IC with
IDC is that transmitters may now have the incentive to amplify the interference
generated at the non-intended receivers, in the hope that Rxs have a better
chance of decoding the interference and removing it. This notion completely
changes the previous paradigm of balancing between maximizing the desired
energy and reducing the generated interference, thus opening up a new dimension
for the beamforming design strategy.
  Our contributions proceed by proving that the optimal rank of the transmit
precoders, optimal in the sense of Pareto optimality and therefore sum rate
optimality, is rank one. Then, we investigate suitable transmit beamforming
strategies for different decoding structures and characterize the Pareto
boundary. As an application of this characterization, we obtain a candidate set
of the maximum sum rate point} which at least contains the set of sum rate
optimal beamforming vectors. We derive the Maximum-Ratio-Transmission (MRT)
optimality conditions. Inspired by the MRT optimality conditions, we propose a
simple algorithm that achieves maximum sum rate in certain scenarios and
suboptimal, in other scenarios comparing to the maximum sum rate.

  This new theoretical technique is general, and can be applied to any magnetic

  A discussion of the causality which is extensively used in Physics has been
done. To obtain the relations, some important concepts like Titchmarsh's
theorem and Cauchy's Theorem have been reviewed, which results in the integral
of a analytic function, that is formed with the magnetic susceptibility used in
the Laplace domain.
  The Cauchy Integral expression in the Laplace domain under certain conditions
leads to a general relations between real and imaginary part of the magnetic
susceptibility in the complex \textit{s}-plane. These new relationships allow
the validation of the magnetic susceptibilility functions developed by
different researchers, in the Laplace domain, not just the frequency response

gravity gravitates. Here we suggest the possibility that dark matter may be
caused by the gravitation of the metric. At first sight this seems impossible
since the gravitational fields in galaxies and cumuli are so weak that it would
seem that second order terms are negligible. Nevertheless, the general theory
of relativity tells us that the gravitation due the metric is given by (grad
g_{00})^2. Thus, a metric field g_{00} varying fast in the space directions
could make a sizeable contribution to the gravitational field despite being a
weak field. As a plausible source of such a field consider that during
reheating the inflaton field disintegrates into radiation. Those quantum decays
that involve higher energies and momenta will produce pockets of metric fields
with rapid change in time and space. The expansion of the universe and
dissipative processes (including the emission of gravitational waves)
eventually result in basically stationary pockets of classical g_{00} field
varying rapidly in space that have collapsed along with matter into structures
like galaxies and cumuli. These pockets should gravitate precisely by the term
mentioned above. They are classical fields and are reminiscent of the cosmic
fields that are scattered in our universe.

the question as to whether we can find a finite and minmalistic set of
operations on structural elements in terms of which any theory can be
expressed. We identify abstraction (grouping similar entities) and
super-structuring (combining topologically e.g., spatio-temporally close
entities) as the essential structural operations in the induction process. We
show that only two more structural operations, namely, reverse abstraction and
reverse super-structuring (the duals of abstraction and super-structuring
respectively) suffice in order to exploit the full power of Turing-equivalent
generative grammars in induction. We explore the implications of this theorem

Maser emission is a strong tool for studying high mass star forming
regions and their evolutionary stages. OH masers in particular can trace the
circumstellar material around protostars and determine their magnetic field
strengths at milliarcsecond resolution.
  Aims. Imaging OH maser mission towards high mass protostellar objects to
determine their evolutionary stages and to locate the detected maser emission
in the process of high mass star formation.
  Methods. In 2007, we surveyed OH maser towards 217 high mass protostellar
objects to study its presence. In this paper, we present a follow up MERLIN
observations of a ground state OH maser emission towards one of these objects,
IRAS 19092+0841.
  Results. Emission from the two OH main spectral lines, 1665 and 1667 MHz,
were detected close to the central object. The positions and velocities of the
OH maser features have been determined. The masers are distributed over a
region of ~ 500 corresponding to 22400 AU (or ~ 0.1 pc) at a distance of 4.48
kpc. The polarization properties of the OH maser features were determined as
well. We identify three Zeeman pairs from which we inferred a magnetic field
strength of ~ 4:4mG pointing towards the observer.
  Conclusions. The relatively small velocity spread and the relatively wide
spacial distribution of the OH maser features support the suggestion that this
object could be in an early evolutionary state before the presence of disk
and/or jet/outfows.

The data of $X(3872)\rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0 J/\psi$ suggest that X(3872)

quark model (LFQM) we calculate the rates of the radiative decays
$X(3872)\rightarrow J/\psi(\psi')\gamma$ supposing X(3872) to be a $2^{-+}$
charmonium. Within this framework, our theoretical prediction on
$\mathcal{BR}(X(3872)\rightarrow\psi(1S)\gamma)$ is at order of $10^{-3}$ which
is slightly lower than the Babar's data but close to the Belle's. Our
prediction on $\mathcal{BR}(X(3872)\rightarrow\psi'\gamma)$ is at order of
$10^{-5}$ if $\psi'$ is a pure 2S state or $10^{-4}$ if $\psi'$ is a $2S-1D$
mixture, which does not conflict with the upper bound set by the Belle
collaboration, but is much lower than the Babar's data. Thus if the future
measurement decides the branching ratio of
$\mathcal{BR}(X(3872)\rightarrow\psi'\gamma)$ to be much larger than $10^{-4}$,
the $2^{-+}$ assignment for X(3872) should be ruled out.

double-peaked broad optical balmer lines of 3C390.3 by theoretical disk model,
we try to find another way to further confirm the origination of double-peaked
line from accretion disk. Based on the long-period observed spectra in optical
band around 1995 collected from AGN WATCH project, the theoretical disk
parameters of disk-like BLRs supposed by elliptical accretion disk model

disk-like BLRs, characters of observed light-curves of broad double-peaked

technique. Thus the accretion disk model is preferred as one better model for
BLRs of 3C390.3. Furthermore, we can find that different disk parameters should
lead to some different results about size of BLRs of 3C390.3 from the one
measured through observational data, which indicates the measured disk
parameters are significantly valid for 3C390.3. After that, the precession of
theoretical elliptical disk-like BLRs being considered, we can find that the
expected line profile in 2000 by theoretical model is consistent with the
observed line profile by HST around 2000. Based on the results, we can further
believe that the origination of broad double-peaked balmer emission lines of
3C390.3 are from accretion disk around central black hole.

forming regions. Towards some of these regions, OH masers are associated with
HII regions. Towards others, believed to be in an earlier evolutionary state,
OH masers are offset from HII regions. Towards these later regions, it is
believed that OH masers are associated with the circumstellar disk (e.g. Edris
et al. 2005; Gray et al. 2003). These disks should be hosting dense dust
grains. The presence of the hot dust could be traced via the millimeter
continuum emission as well as IR emission.
  Aims: studying the association between millimeter (mm) continuum, the OH
masers emission, and IRAS sources.
  Methods: A sample of 27 High Mass Star Forming Regions (HMSFRs) chosen from
IRAS catalog and show OH maser emission (Edris et. al. 2007) have been studied
at 1.1 millimeter (mm) continuum emission of the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey
(BGPS).
  Results: The 1.1-mm continuum emission have been found within ~ 30' towards
23 sources of the OH maser sample. These sources were divided into three groups
depends on the offset of the closest mm peak from the OH maser position. The
association between the OH, mm and IR emissions types have been confirmed for
two sources. Generally the IRAS position is more consistent with the mm peaks
than the OH maser emission and towards 10 sources the IRAS and OH masers are
not consistent with the same mm peak.
  Conclusion: The relatively large positional uncertainty do not allow to firm
conclusions but it seems that the IR peak is closer to the mm emission than the
OH maser.
