these solutions describe general systems of non-extremally charged static

there are conical singularities in between the black rings and for the static

evolution of a first order phase transition. In particular, we have two
non-linear parabolic equations: the first one is deduced from a balance law for
entropy and it describes the evolution of the absolute temperature; the other
one is an equilibrium equation for microforces and it regulates the behaviour
of a scalar phase parameter. Moreover, the second equation shows a
time-relaxation coefficient related to the time-derivative of the phase
parameter.
  We prove well-posedness of solution to the given system, using a standard
method of approximating problems; afterwards, we study the behaviour of the
system as the time-relaxation coefficient tends to zero: as a result, we find
out that the original problem converges to a new problem, with a stationary
phase equation.

Schr\""{o}dinger operators with Dirichlet boundary conditions in bounded
domains. In dimension one, the $n$th eigenfunction has $n$ nodal domains. The
Courant Theorem claims that in any dimension, the number of nodal domains of
the $n$th eigenfunction cannot exceed $n$. However, in dimensions higher than 1
the equality can hold for only finitely many eigenfunctions. Thus, a ""nodal
deficiency"" arises. Examples are known of eigenfunctions with arbitrarily large
index $n$ that have just two nodal domains.
  It was suggested in the recent years to look at the partitions of the domain,
rather than eigenfunctions. It was shown in a recent paper by Helffer,
Hoffmann-Ostenhof and Terracini that (under some natural conditions) bipartite
partitions minimizing the maximum of the ground-state energies in sub-domains
of the partition, correspond to the ""Courant sharp"" eigenfunctions, i.e. to
those with zero nodal deficiency.
  In this paper, the authors show, under some genericity conditions, among the
bipartite equipartitions, the nodal ones correspond exactly to the critical
points of an analogous functional, with the nodal deficiency being equal to the
Morse index at this point. This explains, in particular, why all the minimal
partitions must be Courant sharp.

silica material MCM-41-S15 (of order 15\AA) are too small to allow the amount
of water that is absorbed by these materials (around 0.5gH2O/g substrate) to
occur only inside the pore. Either the additional water is absorbed on the
surface of the silica particles and outside the pores, or else the pores are
larger than the traditional estimates. In addition the low Q Bragg intensities
from a sample of MCM-41-S15 porous silica under different dry and wet
conditions and with different hydrogen isotopes are simulated using a simple
model of the water and silica density profile across the pore. It is found the
best agreement of these intensities with experimental data is shown by assuming
the much larger pore diameter of 25\AA (radius 12.5\AA). Qualitative agreement
is found between these simulated density profiles and those found in recent
empirical potential structure refinement simulations of the same data, even
though the latter data did not specifically include the Bragg peaks in the
structure refinement. It is shown that the change in the (100) peak intensity
on cooling from 300K to 210K, which previously has been ascribed to a change in
density of the confined water on cooling, can equally be ascribed to a change
in density profile at constant average density. It is further pointed out that,
independent of whether the pore diameter really is as large as 25\AA\ or
whether a significant amount of water is absorbed outside the pore, the earlier
reports of a dynamic cross-over in supercooled confined water could in fact be
a crystallisation transition in the larger pore or surface water.

channel discrimination, where a decoder retrieves information by distinguishing
the different quantum channels encoded in each cell of the memory [S.
Pirandola, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 090504 (2011)]. In the case of optical
memories, such as CDs and DVDs, this discrimination involves lossy bosonic
channels and can be remarkably boosted by the use of nonclassical light
(quantum reading). Here we generalize these concepts by extending the model of
memory from single-cell to multi-cell encoding. In general, information is
stored in a block of cells by using a channel-codeword, i.e., a sequence of
channels chosen according to a classical code. Correspondingly, the readout of
data is realized by a process of ""parallel"" channel discrimination, where the
entire block of cells is probed simultaneously and decoded via an optimal
collective measurement. In the limit of an infinite block we define the quantum
reading capacity of the memory, quantifying the maximum number of readable bits
per cell. This notion of capacity is nontrivial when we suitably constrain the
physical resources of the decoder. For optical memories (encoding bosonic
channels), such a constraint is energetic and corresponds to fixing the mean
total number of photons per cell. In this case, we are able to prove a
separation between the quantum reading capacity and the maximum information
rate achievable by classical transmitters, i.e., arbitrary classical mixtures
of coherent states. In fact, we can easily construct nonclassical transmitters
that are able to outperform any classical transmitter, thus showing that the
advantages of quantum reading persist in the optimal multi-cell scenario.

of the tunneling current within the Simmons model. In this paper devoted to
vacuum nano-junctions, we compare the Simmons results for $V_t$ with those
obtained from the exact Schrodinger equation by exactly including the classical
image effects. The comparison reveals that the Simmons estimates for $V_t$ are
completely unacceptable for nanogap sizes ($d$) at which image effects are
important. The Simmons treatment drastically overestimates these effects,
because it misses the famous 1/2 factor related to the fact that the image
interaction energy is a self energy. The maximum of the Simmons curve $V_t$ vs.
$d$ turns out to be merely an artefact of an inappropriate approximation.
Unlike the Simmons approach, the ""exact"" WKB method yields results, which
qualitatively agree with the exact ones; quantitative differences are
important, demonstrating that the transmission prefactor has a significant
impact on $V_t$. Further, we show that a difference between the work functions
of the left and right electrodes, which gives rise to a Volta field, may be
important for the ubiquitous asymmetry of the measured $I$-$V$-characteristics
in general, and for the different $V_t$-values at positive and negative biases
reported in vacuum nanojunctions in particular. The weak dependence $V_t =
V_t(d)$ found experimentally in vacuum nanojunctions contrasts to the
pronounced dependence obtained by including the exact electrostatic image
contribution into the Schrodinger equation. This demonstrates that not only the
molecular transport, but also the transport through a vacuum nanogap represents
a nontrivial problem, which requires further refinements, e.g., a realistic
description of contacts' geometry, retardation effects due to the finite
tunneling time, local phonons, surface plasmons or electron image states.

defined solely by the graphs they reside on. This feature allows us to use
properties of topological graph theory to determine the graphs which are
suitable as homological stabilizer codes. We then show that all toric codes are
equivalent to homological stabilizer codes on 4-valent graphs. We show that the
topological color codes and toric codes correspond to two distinct classes of

small set of constraints the only homological stabilizer codes without local
logical operators are equivalent to Kitaev's toric code or to the topological

interesting long term periodicities in their spin-down rates. At least some of
these pulsars also undergo sharp changes in pulse profile. This has been
convincingly attributed to the stars abruptly switching between two different
magnetospheric states. The sharpness of these transitions has been taken as
evidence against free precession as the mechanism behind the long term
variations. We argue that such a conclusion is premature. By performing a
simple best-fit analysis to the data, we show that the relationship between the
observed spin and modulation periods is of approximately the correct form to be
accounted for by the free precession of a population of neutron stars with
strained crusts, the level of strain being similar in all of the stars, and
consistent with the star retaining a memory of a former faster rotation rate.
We also provide an argument as to why abrupt magnetospheric changes can occur
in precessing stars, and how such changes would serve to magnify the effect of
precession in the timing data, making the observation of the precession more
likely in those stars where such switching occurs. We describe how future
observations could further test the precession hypothesis advanced here.

irrational values only in a set of Hausdorff dimension zero. This result

(139775) 2001 QG298 has changed substantially since the first observations in

\Deltam{2010}=0.7\pm0.1 mag, significantly lower than in 2003,
\Deltam{2003}=1.14\pm0.04 mag. This change is most simply interpreted if 2001
QG298 has an obliquity near 90 deg. The observed decrease in \Deltam is caused
by a change in viewing geometry, from equator-on in 2003 to nearly 16 deg (the
orbital angular distance covered by the object between the observations) off
the equator in 2010. The 2003 and 2010 lightcurves have the same rotation
period and appear in phase when shifted by an integer number of full rotations,
also consistent with high obliquity. Based on the new 2010 lightcurve data, we
find that 2001 QG298 has an obliquity {\epsilon}=90\pm30 deg. Current estimates
of the intrinsic fraction of contact binaries in the Kuiper belt are debiased
assuming that these objects have randomly oriented spins. If, as 2001 QG298,
KBO contact binaries tend to have large obliquities, a larger correction is
required. As a result, the abundance of contact binaries may be larger than
previously believed.

acceleration and provides a good ab initio prediction of the value of the
growth rate including its full parameter-dependency. Our analysis clearly
points out the requirements for exponential Fermi acceleration, thereby opening
the perspective of finding other systems exhibiting this unusual behaviour.

systems may already be dominated by a strong, broad Lyman-alpha line (~80% of
the FUV luminosity), we find that resonant scattering further enhances the
Lyman-alpha density in the deep molecular layers of the disk. Lyman-alpha is
scattered downwards efficiently by the photodissociated atomic hydrogen layer
that exists above the molecular disk. In contrast, FUV-continuum photons pass
unimpeded through the photodissociation layer, and (forward-)scatter
inefficiently off dust grains. Using detailed, adaptive grid Monte Carlo
radiative transfer simulations we show that the resulting
Lyman-alpha/FUV-continuum photon density ratio is strongly stratified;
FUV-continuum dominated in the photodissociation layer, and Lyman-alpha
dominated field in the molecular disk. The enhancement is greatest in the
interior of the disk (r~1AU) but is also observed in the outer disk (r~100AU).

evolutionary processes such as grain settling and gain growth. We find that
blanketing due to advanced grain-growth (a_max > 1 micron) can reduce the X-ray
opacity of dust appreciably at E_X ~ 1keV, coincident with the peak of typical
T Tauri X-ray spectra. However, the reduction of dust opacity by dust settling,
which is known to occur in protoplanetary disks, is probably a more significant
effect. The absorption of 1-10keV X-rays is dominated by gas opacity once the
dust abundance has been reduced to about 1% of its diffuse interstellar value.
The gas disk establishes a floor to the opacity at which point X-ray transport
becomes insensitive to further dust evolution. Our choice of fitting function
follows that of Morrison & McCammon (1983), providing a degree of
backward-compatibility.

Prior
modeling of its light-curve assumed a dark, inclined, non-transparent or
semi-transparent, dusty disk with a central hole. The hole was necessary to
explain the light-curve with a sharp mid-eclipse brightening.
  The aim of the present paper is to study the effects of dust on the
light-curves of eclipsing binary stars and to develop an alternative physical
model for $\epsilon$ Aur type objects which is based on the optical properties
of dust grains.
  The code Shellspec has been modified to calculate the light-curves and
spectra of such objects. The code solves the radiative transfer along the line
of sight in interacting binaries. Dust and angle dependent Mie scattering were
introduced into the code for this purpose.
  Our model of $\epsilon$ Aur consists of two geometrically thick flared disks:
an internal optically thick disk and an external optically thin disk which
absorbs and scatters radiation. Disks are in the orbital plane and are almost
edge-on. We argue that there is no need for an inclined disk with a hole to
explain the current eclipse of $\epsilon$ Aur not even if there is a possible
shallow mid-eclipse brightening. It was demonstrated that phase dependent light
scattering and the optical properties of the dust can have an important effect
on the light-curves of such stars and can even produce a mid-eclipse
brightening. This is a natural consequence of the strong forward scattering. It
was also demonstrated that shallow mid-eclipse brightening might result from
eclipses by nearly edge-on flared (dusty or gaseous) disks.

equations is a challenging problem. Its resolution has wide ranging
applications- from crack propagation to diagnostic medicine. The two
ingredients of any integral equation methodology is the representation of the
domain and the design of approximation spaces to represent physical quantities
on the domain. The order of convergence depends on both the surface and
geometry representation. For instance, most surface models are restricted to
piecewise at or second order tessellations. Similarly, the most commonly known
basis spaces for acoustics are piecewise constant functions. What is desirable
is a framework that permits adaptivity (of size and order) in both geometry and
function representations. Unlike volumetric, differential equation solvers,
such as the finite element method, developing an hpadaptive framework for
surface integral equations is very difficult. This papers proposes a resolution
to this problem by developing a novel framework that relies on reconstruction
of the surface using locally smooth parameterizations, and defining partition
of unity functions and higher order basis spaces on overlapping domains. This
permits easy refinement of both the geometry and function representation. This
capabilities of the proposed framework are shown via a number of numerical
examples

this framework, we compare the observed growth rate of clustering measured with
those predicted by the current Liouville models. Performing a chi^2 statistical

match sufficiently well with the observed growth rate. To further test the
viability of the models under study, we use the Press-Schechter formalism to
derive their expected redshift distribution of cluster-size halos that will be

number of model runs. When those demand too much computation time, it is
necessary to use a reduced model (metamodel) to perform sensitivity analysis,
whose outputs are numerically close to the ones of the original model, while
being much faster to run. In this case, estimated indices are subject to two
kinds of errors: sampling error, caused by the computation of the integrals
appearing in the definition of the Sobol indices by a Monte-Carlo method, and
metamodel error, caused by the replacement of the original model by the
metamodel. In cases where we have certified bounds for the metamodel error, we
propose a method to quantify both types of error, and we compute confidence
intervals for first-order Sobol indices.

are typically characterized by the time and space scale separation of patterns
of motion, with fewer slowly evolving variables and much larger set of faster
evolving variables. This time-space scale separation causes direct numerical
simulation of the evolution of the dynamics to be computationally expensive,
due both to the large number of variables and the necessity to choose a small
discretization time step in order to resolve the fast components of dynamics.
In this work we propose a simple method of determining the closed model for
slow variables alone, which requires only a single computation of appropriate
statistics for the fast dynamics with a certain fixed state of the slow
variables. The method is based on the first-order Taylor expansion of the
averaged coupling term with respect to the slow variables, which can be
computed using the linear fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that, with
simple linear coupling in both slow and fast variables, this method produces
quite comparable statistics to what is exhibited by a complete two-scale model.
The main advantage of the method is that it applies even when the statistics of
the full multiscale model cannot be simulated due to computational complexity,
which makes it practical for real-world large scale applications.

gravity, there are exactly three distinct cosmological solutions which produce
a scale invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations in a dynamical attractor
background, assuming vacuum initial conditions: slow-roll inflation; a slowly
contracting adiabatic ekpyrotic phase, described by a rapidly-varying equation
of state; and an adiabatic ekpyrotic phase on a slowly expanding background. Of
these three, only inflation remains weakly coupled over a wide range of modes,
the other scenarios can produce at most 12 e-folds of scale invariant and
gaussian modes. In this paper, we investigate how allowing the speed of sound
of fluctuations to evolve in time affects this classification. While in the
presence of a variable sound speed there are many more scenarios which are
scale invariant at the level of the two-point function, they generically suffer
from strong coupling problems similar to those in the canonical case. There is,
however, an exceptional case with superluminal sound speed, which suppresses
non-gaussianities and somewhat alleviates strong coupling issues. We focus on a
particular realization of this limit and show these scenarios are constrained
and only able to produce at most 28 e-folds of scale invariant and gaussian
perturbations. A similar bound should hold more generally --- the condition
results from the combined requirements of matching the observed amplitude of
curvature perturbations, demanding that the Hubble parameter remain
sub-Planckian and keeping non-gaussianities under control. We therefore
conclude that inflation remains the unique scenario, assuming a single degree
of freedom on an attractor background, capable of producing arbitrarily many
scale invariant modes while remaining weakly coupled. Alternative mechanisms
must inevitably be unstable or rely on multiple degrees of freedom.

characteristic high luminosities (M_bol ~ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a few
broad absorption lines, and no evidence for H or He. We have constructed a full
multi-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energy
distribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-series

their light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course of

reionization. By taking into account of the spontaneous, stimulated and
collisional emission of the CII line, we calculate the spin temperature and the
mean intensity as a function of the redshift. When averaged over a
cosmologically large volume, we find that the CII emission from ionized carbon
in individual galaxies is larger than the signal generated by carbon in the
intergalactic medium (IGM). Assuming that the CII luminosity is proportional to
the carbon mass in dark matter halos, we also compute the power spectrum of the
CII line intensity at various redshifts. In order to avoid the contamination
from CO rotational lines at low redshift when targeting a CII survey at high
redshifts, we propose the cross-correlation of CII and 21-cm line emission from
high redshifts. To explore the detectability of the CII signal from
reionization, we also evaluate the expected errors on the CII power spectrum
and CII-21 cm cross power spectrum based on the design of the future milimeter

features that captures physics during reionization, including the ionized
bubble sizes and the mean ionization fraction, which are challenging to measure

what the implications are. I demonstrate that, through the tidal field impact
upon exposed star clusters, the CFRg mass-radius relation rules cluster infant
weight-loss in dependence of cluster mass. The observational constraint of a
time-invariant slope for the power-law young cluster mass function is robustly
satisfied by CFRgs with a constant mean volume density. In contrast, a constant
mean surface density would be conducive to the preferential destruction of
high-mass clusters. A purely dynamical line-of-reasoning leads therefore to a
conclusion consistent with star formation a process driven by a volume density
threshold. Developing this concept further, properties of molecular clumps and
CFRgs naturally get dissociated. This allows to understand: (i) why the star

perturbative coupling bounds to constrain the model. Surprisingly, we find that
a large enough baryon asymmetry is only consistently achieved in a small subset
of parameter space in 2HDMs, regardless of trying to simultaneously account for
any B physics anomaly. There is some tension between simultaneous explanation
of the dimuon anomaly and baryogenesis, but using a Markov chain Monte Carlo we
find several models within 1 sigma of the central values. We point out
shortcomings with previous studies that reached different conclusions. The
restricted parameter space that allows for EWBG makes this scenario highly
predictive for collider searches. We discuss the most promising signatures to
pursue at the LHC for EWBG-compatible models.

measure the turbulent broadening of molecular lines. These measurements
constrain disk angular momentum transport, and furnish evidence of the
turbulent environment within which planetesimal formation takes place. We use
local magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) to predict the distribution of turbulent velocities in low
mass protoplanetary disks, as a function of radius and height above the
mid-plane. We model both ideal MHD disks, and disks in which Ohmic dissipation
results in a dead zone of suppressed turbulence near the mid-plane. Under ideal
conditions, the disk mid-plane is characterized by a velocity distribution that
peaks near v \simeq 0.1cs (where cs is the local sound speed), while supersonic
velocities are reached at z > 3H (where H is the pressure scale height).
Residual velocities of v \approx 0.01cs persist near the mid-plane in dead
zones, while the surface layers remain active. Anisotropic variation of the
linewidth with disk inclination is modest. We compare our MHD results to
hydrodynamic simulations in which large-scale forcing is used to initiate
similar turbulent velocities. We show that the qualitative trend of increasing
v with height, seen in the MHD case, persists for forced turbulence and is
likely a generic property of disk turbulence. Percent level determinations of v
at different heights within the disk, or spatially resolved observations that
probe the inner disk containing the dead zone region, are therefore needed to
test whether the MRI is responsible for protoplanetary disk turbulence.

accumulation of gas at the centre of proto-galaxies. In the first stage, the
accumulated gas forms a super-massive star whose core collapses when the
nuclear fuel is exhausted, forming a black hole of $M_{\rm BH} \approx 100
M_{\sun}$. As the black hole starts accreting, it inflates the surrounding
dense gas into an almost hydrostatic self-gravitating envelope, with at least
10-100 times the mass of the hole. We find that these ""quasistars"" suffer
extremely high rates of mass loss through winds from their envelopes, in
analogy to very massive stars such as eta-Carinae. Only for envelope masses
greater than 2.8 \times 10^{5} (M_{\rm BH}/100 M_{\sun})^{9/11} is the envelope
evaporation time-scale longer than the accretion time-scale of the black hole.
This relation thus constitutes a ""threshold growth line"" above which quasistars
can grow their internal black holes. Accretion rates can be 10 to 100 times the
Eddington rate. The quasistars born in this ""growth region"" with 10^7-10^8
M_{\sun} can grow black holes with masses between 10^4$ to $10^5 M_{\sun},
before crossing the threshold growth line and dispersing their envelopes in
less than $10^4$ yr. This scenario therefore predicts that massive black hole
seeds can be found only in dark matter halos with total masses larger than
about 10^9 M_{\sun}, which can provide sufficiently high accretion rates to
form such massive quasistars.

Here we combine integral-field spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging of 42
double-peaked [O III] AGNs from Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the
constituents of the population. We find two binary AGNs where the
line-splitting is driven by the orbital motion of the merging nuclei. Such
objects account for only ~2% of the double-peaked AGNs. Almost all (~98%) of
the double-peaked AGNs were selected because of gas kinematics; and half of
those show spatially resolved narrow-line regions that extend 4-20 kpc from the
nuclei. Serendipitously, we find two spectrally unresolved binary AGNs where
gas kinematics produced the double-peaked [O III] lines. The relatively
frequent serendipitous discoveries indicate that only ~1% of binary AGNs would
appear double-peaked in Sloan spectra and 2.2_{-0.8}^{+2.5}% of all Sloan AGNs
are binary AGNs. Therefore, the double-peaked sample does not offer much
advantage over any other AGN samples in finding binary AGNs. The binary AGN
fraction implies an elevated AGN duty cycle (8_{-3}^{+8}%), suggesting galaxy
interactions enhance nuclear accretion. We illustrate that integral-field
spectroscopy is crucial for identifying binary AGNs: several objects previously
classified as ""binary AGNs"" with long-slit spectra are most likely single AGNs
with extended narrow-line regions. The formation of extended narrow-line

such consideration. In Model 1, the 7-branes wrap the flat R^4 directions,
leading to the well known Sp(2r) theories. We study singularity structure of
moduli space of Seiberg-Witten curve, such as maximal Argyres-Douglas loci, in
order to construct 1-1 map between moduli spaces. In Model 2, the 7-branes are
wrapped on Taub-NUT and multi Taub-NUT spaces instead of R^4. These
configurations may explain many of the Gaiotto-type constructions including
possible extensions to non-conformal models with cascading behaviors. In this
model the UV is described by the probe D3s decomposed into D5-anti D5 pairs
wrapped on multi Taub-NUT space, while the IR remains a 4d theory. For certain
arrangements of the 7-branes, this model may be dualized to the brane networks
of Benini, Benvenuti and Tachikawa. The Gaiotto dualities in Model 2 are
explained by chiral anomaly cancellations, anti-GSO projections and brane
transmutations. Model 3 is described by seven-branes wrapped on a K3 manifold
and D3 and anti-D3 probes whose number may differ at most by 24. These
constructions could lead to new N = 2 models with possible dualities to both
type IIB and heterotic theories on non-Kahler manifolds. In the limit where the
number of probes becomes very large, the physics is captured by M(atrix) theory
on K3 x K3 manifold. Finally, Model 4 is described by k D3s probing
intersecting seven-brane backgrounds with Sp(2k) x Sp(2k) gauge group. These
constructions could produce new N =1 heterotic dual on a non-Kahler K3 manifold
that is no longer conformally Calabi-Yau. We discuss possible constraints on

quenching is already either an S0 or Sa, while we find no passive galaxies of
class Sb or later. Hence the formation of passive early-type galaxies in
cluster cores must involve the prior morphological transformation of late-type
spirals into Sa/S0s, perhaps via pre-processing or the impact of cluster tidal
fields, before a subsequent quenching of star formation once the lenticular
encounters the dense environment of the cluster core. In the cases of many
cluster S0s, this phase of star-formation quenching is characterised by an
excess of 70um emission, indicating that the cold dust content is declining at
a slower rate than star formation.

excitations applicable to all even-even nuclei beyond the lightest. The theory
is the well-known generator-coordinate extension (GCM) of the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov self-consistent mean field theory (HFB). We use the
discrete-basis Hill-Wheel method (HW) to compute the wave functions with an
interaction from the Gogny family of Hamiltonians. Comparing to the compiled
experimental data on octupole excitations, we find that the performance of the
theory depends on the deformation characteristics of the nucleus. For
nondeformed nuclei, the theory reproduces the energies to about 20 % apart from
an overall scale factor of about 1.6. The performance is somewhat poorer for
(quadrupole) deformed nuclei, and for both together the dispersion of the
scaled energies about the experimental values is about 25 %. This compares
favorably with the performance of similar theories of the quadrupole
excitations. Nuclei having static octupole deformations in HFB form a special
category. These nuclei have the smallest measured octupole excitation energies
as well as the smallest predicted energies. However, in these cases the
energies are seriously underpredicted by the theory. We find that a simple
two-configuration approximation, the Minimization After Projection method,
(MAP) is almost as accurate as the full HW treatment, provided that the
octupole-deformed nuclei are omitted from the comparison. This article is

on the microscopic parameters (like the Brans-Dicke coupling, for example) that
govern the strength of scalar-matter couplings at the particle level in
particular models. Here we present fits to timing data for several pulsars
directly in terms of the phenomenological couplings (masses, scalar charges,
moment of inertia sensitivities and so on) of the stars involved, rather than
to the more microscopic parameters of a specific model. For instance, for the
double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B we find at the 68% confidence level that the
masses are bounded by 1.28 < m_A/m_sun < 1.34 and 1.19 < m_B/m_sun < 1.25,
while the scalar-charge to mass ratios satisfy |a_A| < 0.21, |a_B| < 0.21 and
|a_B - a_A| < 0.002$. These constraints are independent of the details of the
scalar tensor model involved, and of assumptions about the stellar equations of
state. Our fits can be used to constrain a broad class of scalar tensor
theories by computing the fit quantities as functions of the microscopic
parameters in any particular model. For the Brans-Dicke and quasi-Brans-Dicke
models, the constraints obtained in this manner are consistent with those

LTT 560 displays an Halpha emission line consisting of two anti-phased
components. While one of them was clearly caused by stellar activity from the
secondary late-type main-sequence star, our analysis indicated that the white
dwarf primary star is potentially the origin of the second component. However,
the low resolution of the data means that our interpretation remains ambiguous.
We here use time-series UVES data to compare the radial velocities of the
Halpha emission components to those of metal absorption lines from the primary
and secondary stars. We find that the weaker component most certainly
originates in the white dwarf and is probably caused by accretion. An abundance
analysis of the white dwarf spectrum yields accretion rates that are consistent
with mass loss from the secondary due to a stellar wind. The second and
stronger Halpha component is attributed to stellar activity on the secondary
star. An active secondary is likely to be present because of the occurrence of
a flare in our time-resolved spectroscopy. Furthermore, Roche tomography
indicates that a significant area of the secondary star on its leading side and
close to the first Lagrange point is covered by star spots. Finally, we derive
the parameters for the system and place it in an evolutionary context. We find
that the white dwarf is a very slow rotator, suggesting that it has had an
angular-momentum evolution similar to that of field white dwarfs. We predict
that LTT 560 will begin mass transfer via Roche-lobe overflow in about 3.5
Gyrs, and conclude that the system is representative of the progenitors of the
current population of cataclysmic variables. It will most likely evolve to
become an SU UMa type dwarf nova.

We reexamine this probe in light of the recent experimental analyses of the

importance of initial state fluctuations propagated by hydrodynamic flow in
these correlations. The NEXSPHERIO model combines fluctuating initial
conditions with viscosity-free hydrodynamic evolution and, indeed, has been
shown to describe azimuthal correlations. We use this model to compute the
number density correlation $R_{2}$ and the momentum current correlation
function {\it C}, at low transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $~200 GeV. {\it C} is sensitive to details of the collision
dynamics. Its longitudinal width is expected to broaden under the influence of
viscous effects and narrow in the presence of sizable radial flow. While
NEXSPHERIO model qualitatively describes the emergence of a near-side
ridge-like structure for both the $R_2$ and {\it C} observables, we find that
it predicts a longitudinal narrowing of the near side peak of these correlation
functions for increasing number of participants in contrast with recent
observations by the STAR Collaboration of a significant broadening in most
central collisions relative to peripheral collisions.

krausz $(k,m)$-partition. 1-krausz dimension is known and studied krausz
dimension of graph $kdim(G)$.
  In this paper we prove, that the problem $""kdim(G)\leq 3""$ is polynomially
solvable for chordal graphs, thus partially solving the problem of P. Hlineny
and J. Kratochvil. We show, that the problem of finding $m$-krausz dimension is
NP-hard for every $m\geq 1$, even if restricted to (1,2)-colorable graphs, but
the problem $""kdim_m(G)\leq k""$ is polynomially solvable for $(\infty,1)$-polar
graphs for every fixed $k,m\geq 1$.

heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) with flexible cell association policies.
The HCN is modeled as a multi-tier cellular network where each tier's base
stations (BSs) are randomly located and have a particular transmit power, path
loss exponent, spatial density, and bias towards admitting mobile users. For
example, as compared to macrocells, picocells would usually have lower transmit
power, higher path loss exponent (lower antennas), higher spatial density (many
picocells per macrocell), and a positive bias so that macrocell users are
actively encouraged to use the more lightly loaded picocells. In the present
paper we implicitly assume all base stations have full queues; future work
should relax this. For this model, we derive the outage probability of a
typical user in the whole network or a certain tier, which is equivalently the
downlink SINR cumulative distribution function. The results are accurate for
all SINRs, and their expressions admit quite simple closed-forms in some
plausible special cases. We also derive the \emph{average ergodic rate} of the
typical user, and the \emph{minimum average user throughput} -- the smallest
value among the average user throughputs supported by one cell in each tier. We
observe that neither the number of BSs or tiers changes the outage probability
or average ergodic rate in an interference-limited full-loaded HCN with
unbiased cell association (no biasing), and observe how biasing alters the
various metrics.

stars, 95 archival RXTE datasets of an atoll source 4U 1608-522, acquired over

exhibited 3-30 keV luminosity in the range of <~ 10^35 - 4 x 10^37 erg s^-1,
assuming a distance of 3.6 kpc. The 3-30 keV PCA spectra, produced one from
each dataset, were represented successfully with a combination of a soft and a
hard component, of which the presence was revealed in a model-independent
manner by studying spectral variations among the observations. The soft
component is expressed by so-called multi-color disk model with a temperature
of ~1.8 keV, and is attributed to the emission from an optically-thick standard
accretion disk. The hard component is a blackbody emission with a temperature
of ~2.7 keV, thought to be emitted from the neutron-star surface. As the total
luminosity increases, a continuous decrease was observed in the ratio of the
blackbody luminosity to that of the disk component. This property suggests that
the matter flowing through the accretion disk gradually becomes difficult to
reach the neutron-star surface, presumably forming outflows driven by the
increased radiation pressure. On time scales of hours to days, the overall
source variability was found to be controlled by two independent variables; the
mass accretion rate, and the innermost disk radius which changes both
physically and artificially.

increasingly complex. Moreover, the queries and the schemas have to continually

  An effective index deployment ordering can produce (1) a prompt query runtime

essential qualities of design tools for quickly evolving databases, but
optimizing the problem is challenging because of complex index interactions and
a factorial number of possible solutions.

to exact search techniques, we also studied local search algorithms to find
near optimal solution very quickly.
  Our empirical analysis on the TPC-H dataset shows that our pruning techniques

namely arbitrary-order Hilbert spectral analysis, to characterize the
scale-invariant properties of a time series directly in an amplitude-frequency
space. We first show numerically that due to a nonlinear distortion,
traditional methods require high-order harmonic components to represent
nonlinear processes, except for the Hilbert-based method. This will lead to an
artificial energy flux from the low-frequency (large scale) to the
high-frequency (small scale) part. Thus the power law, if it exists, is
contaminated. We then compare the Hilbert method with structure functions (SF),
detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and wavelet leader (WL) by analyzing
fractional Brownian motion and synthesized multifractal time series. For the
former simulation, we find that all methods provide comparable results. For the
latter simulation, we perform simulations with an intermittent parameter {\mu}
= 0.15. We find that the SF underestimates scaling exponent when q > 3. The
Hilbert method provides a slight underestimation when q > 5. However, both DFA
and WL overestimate the scaling exponents when q > 5. It seems that Hilbert and
DFA methods provide better singularity spectra than SF and WL. We finally apply
all methods to a passive scalar (temperature) data obtained from a jet
experiment with a Taylor's microscale Reynolds number Relambda \simeq 250. Due
to the presence of strong ramp-cliff structures, the SF fails to detect the
power law behavior. For the traditional method, the ramp-cliff structure causes
a serious artificial energy flux from the low-frequency (large scale) to the
high-frequency (small scale) part. Thus DFA and WL underestimate the scaling
exponents. However, the Hilbert method provides scaling exponents
{\xi}{\theta}(q) quite close to the one for longitudinal velocity.

to the presence of strong electrostatic interactions between the charged block
and counterions, the block copolymer morphologies are rather different than
their neutral counterpart at low dielectric constant, however at high
dielectric constant the neutral diblock behaviors are observed. This article
highlights the effect of dielectric constant of two different media on
different thermodynamic and dynamic quantities. At low dielectric, the
morphologies are a direct outcome of the ion-counterion multiplet formation. At
high dielectric, these charged diblocks behavior resembles that of neutral and
weakly charged polymers with sustainable long-range order. Similar behavior has

magnetized, parsec-scale clumps of molecular clouds, using three-dimensional
numerical simulations that include protostellar outflow feedback. The dense
cores are identified in the simulated density data cube through a clumpfind
algorithm. We find that the core velocity dispersion does not show any clear
dependence on the core size, in contrast to Larson's linewidth-size relation,
but consistent with recent observations. In the absence of a magnetic field,
the majority of the cores have supersonic velocity dispersions. A
moderately-strong magnetic field reduces the dispersion to a subsonic or at
most transonic value typically. Most of the cores are out of virial
equilibrium, with the external pressure dominating the self-gravity. The
implication is that the core evolution is largely controlled by the
outflow-driven turbulence. Even an initially-weak magnetic field can retard
star formation significantly, because the field is amplified by the
outflow-driven turbulence to an equipartition strength, with the distorted
field component dominating the uniform one. In contrast, for a
moderately-strong field, the uniform component remains dominant. Such a
difference in the magnetic structure is evident in our simulated polarization
maps of dust thermal emission; it provides a handle on the field strength.
Recent polarization measurements show that the field lines in cluster-forming
clumps are spatially well-ordered. It is indicative of a moderately-strong,
dynamically important, field which, in combination with outflow feedback, can
keep the rate of star formation in embedded clusters at the
observationally-inferred, relatively-slow rate of several percent per free-fall
time.

galactic nuclei (AGNs) and quasars originates from ongoing star formation in
the self-gravitating part of accretion disks around the supermassive black
holes. We designate this region as the star forming (SF) disk, in which metals
are produced from supernova explosions (SNexp) while at the same time inflows
are driven by SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity to accrete onto the SMBHs. In
this paper, an equation of metallicity governed by SNexp and radial advection
is established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the SF disk.
We find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at different
positions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolves
for steady-state AGNs. Metallicity as an integrated physical parameter can be
used as a probe of the SF disk age during one episode of SMBH activity. In the
SF disk, evaporation of molecular clouds heated by SNexp blast waves
unavoidably forms hot gas. This heating is eventually balanced by the cooling
of the hot gas, but we show that the hot gas will escape from the SF disk
before being cooled, and diffuse into the BLRs forming with a typical rate of
$\sim 1\sunmyr$. The diffusion of hot gas from a SF disk depends on ongoing
star formation, leading to the metallicity gradients in BLR observed in AGNs.
We discuss this and other observable consequences of this scenario.

single-band Hubbard model away from half-filling with on-site attraction $U$
and nearest neighbor hopping $t$. Our goal is to understand the crossover from
BCS superfluidity in the weak attraction limit to the BEC of molecules in the
strong attraction limit, with particular emphasis on how this crossover in an
optical lattice differs from the much better studied continuum problem. We use
a large-$N$ theory with Sp(2N) symmetry to study the fluctuations beyond mean
field theory. At T=0, we calculate across the crossover various observables,
including chemical potential, gap, ground state energy, speed of sound and
compressibility. The superfluid density $n_s$ is found to have non-trivial
$U/t$ dependence in this lattice system. We show that the transition
temperature $T_c$ scales with the energy gap in the weak coupling limit but
crosses over to a $t^2/U$ scaling in the BEC limit, where phase fluctuations
controlled by $n_s$ determine $T_c$. We also find, quite contrary to our
expectations, that in the strong coupling limit, the large-$N$ theory gives
qualitatively wrong trends for compressibility. A comparison with a simple
Hartree shifted BCS theory, which takes into account both pairing and Hartree
shifts, and correctly recovers the atomic limit and the right qualitative trend
for compressibility, reveals that the large-$N$ theory on the lattice, although
considers a larger number of diagrams, is in fact inferior to the simpler
Hartree shifted BCS theory. The failure of the large-$N$ approach is explained
by noting (i) the importance of Hartree shift in lattice problems, and (ii)
inability of the large-$N$ approach to treat particle-particle and
particle-hole channels at equal footing at the saddle point level.

terms of persistent particle displacements of length $a$. At supercooled
conditions, for $a$ of the order of or smaller than a particle diameter, we
find that excitations are associated with correlated particle motions that are
sparse and localized, occupying a volume with an average radius that is
temperature independent and no larger than a few particle diameters. We show
that the statistics and dynamics of these excitations are facilitated and
hierarchical. Excitation energy scales grow logarithmically with $a$.
Excitations at one point in space facilitate the birth and death of excitations
at neighboring locations, and space-time excitation structures are microcosms
of heterogeneous dynamics at larger scales. This nature of dynamics becomes
increasingly dominant as temperature $T$ is lowered. We show that slowing of
dynamics upon decreasing temperature below $T_\mathrm{o}$ is the result of a
decreasing concentration of excitations and concomitant growing hierarchical
length scales, and further that the structural relaxation time $\tau$ follows
the parabolic law, $\log(\tau / \tau_\mathrm{o}) = J^2(1/T -
1/T_\mathrm{o})^2$, for $T<T_\mathrm{o}$, where $J$, $\tau_\mathrm{o}$ and
$T_\mathrm{o}$ can be predicted quantitatively from dynamics at short time

  Special Issue on Compressive Sensing in Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  In this paper, we propose an efficient acquisition scheme for GPS receivers.
It is shown that GPS signals can be effectively sampled and detected using a
bank of randomized correlators with much fewer chip-matched filters than those
used in existing GPS signal acquisition algorithms. The latter use correlations
with all possible shifted replicas of the satellite-specific C/A code and an
exhaustive search for peaking signals over the delay-Doppler space. Our scheme
is based on the recently proposed analog compressed sensing framework, and
consists of a multichannel sampling structure with far fewer correlators.
  The compressive multichannel sampler outputs are linear combinations of a
vector whose support tends to be sparse; by detecting its support one can
identify the strongest satellite signals in the field of view and pinpoint the
correct code-phase and Doppler shifts for finer resolution during tracking. The
analysis in this paper demonstrates that GPS signals can be detected and
acquired via the proposed structure at a lower cost in terms of number of
correlations that need to be computed in the coarse acquisition phase, which in
current GPS technology scales like the product of the number of all possible
delays and Doppler shifts. In contrast, the required number of correlators in
our compressive multichannel scheme scales as the number of satellites in the
field of view of the device times the logarithm of number of delay-Doppler bins
explored, as is typical for compressed sensing methods.

several AUs would be a major milestone in extrasolar planets astrophysics. This
fundamental goal can be achieved with a mission concept such as NEAT - the
Nearby Earth Astrometric Telescope. NEAT is designed to carry out space-borne
extremely-high-precision astrometric measurements sufficient to detect
dynamical effects due to orbiting planets of mass even lower than Earth's
around the nearest stars. Such a survey mission would provide the actual
planetary masses and the full orbital geometry for all the components of the
detected planetary systems down to the Earth-mass limit. The NEAT performance
limits can be achieved by carrying out differential astrometry between the
targets and a set of suitable reference stars in the field. The NEAT instrument
design consists of an off-axis parabola single-mirror telescope, a detector
with a large field of view made of small movable CCDs located around a fixed
central CCD, and an interferometric calibration system originating from
metrology fibers located at the primary mirror. The proposed mission
architecture relies on the use of two satellites operating at L2 for 5 years,
flying in formation and offering a capability of more than 20,000
reconfigurations (alternative option uses deployable boom). The NEAT primary
science program will encompass an astrometric survey of our 200 closest F-, G-
and K-type stellar neighbors, with an average of 50 visits. The remaining time
might be allocated to improve the characterization of the architecture of
selected planetary systems around nearby targets of specific interest (low-mass
stars, young stars, etc.) discovered by Gaia, ground-based high-precision
radial-velocity surveys.

It
is shown that the isomorphism between Lifshitz algebras with dynamical
exponents z and 1/z naturally leads to a duality between low and high
temperature regimes. Assuming the existence of gap in the spectrum, this
duality allows to obtain a precise formula for the asymptotic growth of the
number of states with a fixed energy which depends on z and the energy of the
ground state, and reduces to the Cardy formula for z=1. The holographic
realization of the duality can be naturally inferred from the fact that
Euclidean Lifshitz spaces in three dimensions with dynamical exponents and
characteristic lengths given by z, l, and 1/z, l/z, respectively, are
diffeomorphic. The semiclassical entropy of black holes with Lifshitz
asymptotics can then be recovered from the generalization of Cardy formula,
where the ground state corresponds to a soliton. An explicit example is
provided by the existence of a purely gravitational soliton solution for BHT
massive gravity, which precisely has the required energy that reproduces the
entropy of the analytic asymptotically Lifshitz black hole with z=3.
Remarkably, neither the asymptotic symmetries nor central charges were
explicitly used in order to obtain these results.

spectroscopy technique (FT-STS). This technique allows one to probe the
electronic properties of a two-dimensional system by analyzing the standing
waves formed in the vicinity of defects. We review both the experimental and
theoretical aspects of this approach, basing our analysis on some of our
previous results, as well as on other results described in the literature. We
explain how the topology of the constant energy maps can be deduced from the FT
of dI/dV map images which exhibit standing waves patterns. We show that not
only the position of the features observed in the FT maps, but also their shape
can be explained using different theoretical models of different levels of
approximation. Thus, starting with the classical and well known expression of
the Lindhard susceptibility which describes the screening of electron in a free
electron gas, we show that from the momentum dependence of the susceptibility
we can deduce the topology of the constant energy maps in a joint density of
states approximation (JDOS). We describe how some of the specific features
predicted by the JDOS are (or are not) observed experimentally in the FT maps.
The role of the phase factors which are neglected in the rough JDOS
approximation is described using the stationary phase conditions. We present
also the technique of the T-matrix approximation, which takes into account
accurately these phase factors. This technique has been successfully applied to
normal metals, as well as to systems with more complicated constant energy
contours. We present results recently obtained on graphene systems which
demonstrate the power of this technique, and the usefulness of local
measurements for determining the band structure, the map of the Fermi energy

(restricted to Mr<-19.9), provided one uses a parametrization of this function
that is accurate at the bright end. A similar analysis of the luminosity
distribution of the Brightest Satellite Galaxies suggests that they are best
thought of as being the second brightest pick from the same luminosity
distribution of which BCGs are the brightest. I.e., BSGs are not the brightest
of some universal satellite luminosity function, in contrast to what Halo Model
analyses of the luminosity dependence of clustering suggest. However, we then
use mark correlations to provide a novel test of these order statistics,
showing that the hypothesis of a universal luminosity function (i.e. no halo
mass dependence) from which the BCGs and BSGs are drawn is incompatible with
the data, despite the fact that there was no hint of this in the BCG and BSG
luminosity distributions themselves. We also discuss why, since extreme value
statistics are explicitly a function of the number of draws, the consistency of
BCG luminosities with extreme value statistics is most clearly seen if one is
careful to perform the test at fixed group richness N. Tests at, e.g., fixed
total group luminosity Ltot, will generally be biased and may lead to erroneous
conclusions.

structural parameterizations of OCT with respect to their polynomial
kernelizability, i.e., whether instances can be efficiently reduced to a size

when parameterized by the vertex deletion distance to the class of bipartite
graphs of treewidth at most w (for any constant w); this generalizes the
parameter feedback vertex set number (i.e., the distance to a forest).
Complementing this, we exclude polynomial kernels for OCT parameterized by the
distance to outerplanar graphs, conditioned on the assumption that NP \not

graphs is necessary. Further lower bounds are given for parameterization by

large-scale structure measured by the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey in the
redshift range $0.1 < z < 0.9$. We use this data in two ways. Firstly we
constrain the matter density of the Universe, $\omms$ (assuming General
Relativity), and use this to construct a diagnostic to detect the presence of
an evolving Newton's constant. Secondly we directly measure the evolution of
Newton's constant, $\Geff$, that appears in Modified Gravity theories, without
assuming General Relativity to be true. The novelty of these approaches are
that, contrary to other methods, they do not require knowledge of the expansion
history of the Universe, $H(z)$, making them model independent tests. Our
constraints for the second derivative of Newton's constant at the present day,
assuming it is slowly evolving as suggested by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
constraints, using the WiggleZ data is $\ddotGeff(t_0)=-1.19\pm 0.95\cdot
10^{-20}h^2 \textrm{yr}^{-2}$, where $h$ is defined via $H_0=100 h km

Luminous Red Galaxy (SDSS LRG) data is $\ddotGeff(t_0)=-3.6\pm 6.8\cdot
10^{-21}h^2 \rm{yr}^{-2}$, both being consistent with General Relativity.
Finally, our constraint for the rms mass fluctuation $\sigma_8$ using the
WiggleZ data is $\sigma_8=0.75 \pm 0.08$, while using both the WiggleZ and the
SDSS LRG data $\sigma_8=0.77 \pm 0.07$, both in good agreement with the latest

are a twisted exterior holomorphic derivative and its hermitian conjugate
(twisted Dolbeault operators with charge q). The particle model is used to
obtain a worldline representation of the one-loop effective action of the

well understood. One of the explanations that have been proposed is that a
primordial magnetic field renders the rotation uniform in the radiation zone.
We test here the validity of this magnetic scenario through 3D numerical MHD
simulations that encompass both the radiation zone and the convection zone. The
numerical simulations are performed with the anelastic spherical harmonics
(ASH) code. The computational domain extends from $0.07\;R_\odot$ to
$0.97\;R_\odot$. In the parameter regime we explored, a dipolar fossil field
aligned with the rotation axis can not remain confined in the radiation zone.
When the field lines are allowed to interact with turbulent unstationary
convective motions at the base of the convection zone, 3D effects prevent the
field confinement. In agreement with previous work, we find that a dipolar
fossil field, even when it is initially buried deep inside the radiation zone,
will spread into the convective zone. According to Ferraro's law of
iso-rotation, it then imprints on the radiation zone the latitudinal
differential rotation of the convection zone, which is not observed.

We start by deriving a large deviations principle for the cluster size
distribution for any inverse temperature $\beta\in (0,\infty)$ and particle
density $\rho\in(0,\rho_{\mathrm{cp}})$ in the thermodynamic limit. Here
$\rho_{\mathrm{cp}}>0$ is the close packing density. While in general the rate
function is an abstract object, our second main result is the
$\Gamma$-convergence of the rate function toward an explicit limiting rate
function in the low-temperature dilute limit $\beta\to \infty$,
$\rho\downarrow0$ such that $-\beta^{-1}\log\rho\to\nu$ for some
$\nu\in(0,\infty)$. The limiting rate function and its minimisers appeared in
recent work, where the temperature and the particle density were coupled with
the particle number. In the decoupled limit considered here, we prove that just
one cluster size is dominant, depending on the parameter $\nu$. Under
additional assumptions on the potential, the $\Gamma$-convergence along curves
can be strengthened to uniform bounds, valid in a low-temperature, low-density

the models in the X-ray band (nuclear luminosity; hot ISM luminosity and
temperature; temperature and brightness profiles during quiescence and during
outbursts). The nuclear bursts last for ~10^7 yr, with a duty-cycle of a few X
(10^-3-10^-2); the present epoch bolometric nuclear emission is very
sub-Eddington. The ISM thermal luminosity \lx oscillates in phase with the
nuclear one; this helps reproduce statistically the observed large \lx
variation. In quiescence the temperature profile has a negative gradient;
thanks to past outbursts, the brightness profile lacks the steep shape typical
of inflowing models. Outbursts produce disturbances in these profiles. Most
significantly, a hot bubble from shocked hot gas is inflated at the galaxy
center; the bubble would be conical in shape, and show radio emission. The ISM
resumes a smooth appearance on a time-scale of ~200 Myr; the duty-cycle of
perturbances in the ISM is of the order of 5-10%. From the present analysis,
additional input physics is important in the ISM-black hole coevolution, to
fully account for the properties of real galaxies, as a confining external
medium and a jet. The jet will reduce further the mass available for accretion
(and then the Eddington ratio $l$), and may help, together with an external
pressure, to produce flat or positive temperature gradient profiles (observed
in high density environments). Alternatively, $l$ can be reduced if the switch

establish the global-in-time existence of small amplitude solution to the
coupled wave and Klei-Gordon equations with quadratic nonlinearity in four

by S. Katayama, the conditions imposed in this article permit to include some
important nonlinear terms. All of these suggests that this method may be a more

powerful tool in the conceptualisation, design and presentation of
architectural products in the construction industry, providing realistic
interaction and walkthrough on engineering products. Traditional ways of
implementing 3D models involves the use of specialised 3D authoring tools along
with skilled 3D designers with blueprints of the model and this is a slow and
laborious process. The aim of this paper is to automate this process by simply
analyzing the blueprint document and generating the 3D scene automatically. For
this purpose we have devised a 3-Phase recognition approach to pseudo 3D
building generation from 2D floor plan and developed a software accordingly.
Our 3-phased 3D building system has been implemented using C, C++ and OpenCV
library [24] for the Image Processing module; The Save Module generated an XML
file for storing the processed floor plan objects attributes; while the
Irrlitch [14] game engine was used to implement the Interactive 3D module.
Though still at its infancy, our proposed system gave commendable results. We
tested our system on 6 floor plans with complexities ranging from low to high
and the results seems to be very promising with an average processing time of
around 3s and a 3D generation in 4s. In addition the system provides an
interactive walk-though and allows users to modify components.

fusion of event detection. Current decision fusion schemes are based on binary
valued decision and do not consider bursty contextcapture. However, bursty
context and multi-valued data are important characteristics of WSNs. One on
hand, the local decisions from sensors usually have bursty and contextual
characteristics. Fusion center must capture the bursty context information from
the sensors. On the other hand, in practice, many applications need to process
multi-valued data, such as temperature and reflection level used for lightening
prediction. To address these challenges, the Markov modulated Poisson process
(MMPP) and multi-valued logic are introduced into WSNs to perform
context-capture multi-valued decision fusion. The overall decision fusion is
decomposed into two parts. The first part is the context-capture model for WSNs
using superposition MMPP. Through this procedure, the fusion center has a
higher probability to get useful local decisions from sensors. The second one
is focused on multi-valued decision fusion. Fault detection can also be
performed based on MVL. Once the fusion center detects the faulty nodes, all
their local decisions are removed from the computation of the likelihood
ratios. Finally, we evaluate the capability of context-capture and fault
tolerant. The result supports the usefulness of our scheme.

of the smallest MVR, the rings do not fit in and, therefore, do not exist in
such films. Consequently, for superfluid films of He-II, a peculiarity in the
form of a smoothed-out jump should be observed in the curve T_{m}(d) at the
values of thickness approximately equal to the size of the smallest MVR, d= 3 -
9 A (T_{m} is the temperature of the maximum of the broad peak on the curve of
the dependence of the specific heat on temperature). The absence of a similar
peculiarity will be an evidence that MVR do not influence the values of
T_{\lambda} and T_{m}, and do not play any key role in the \lambda-transition.
The currently available experimental data are insufficient for revealing the
predicted peculiarity.

which are added to the 4785 spectra available from SDSS (DR7) to fill-in the
incomplete coverage by SDSS of luminous galaxies. We perform a spectral
classification of the nuclei of galaxies (with a completeness of 98% at

sAGN, LIN) refer to AGNs and the remaining three (HII, RET, PAS) refer to
different stages of starburst activity. To perform such classification, we use
the WHAN diagnostic, after correcting Halpha by 1.3 A for underlying
absorption. We find that 482 (10%) of 5027 galaxies host an AGN: their
frequency strongly increases with increasing luminosity of the parent galaxies,

found in red galaxies with <g-i> < 1.15 \pm 0.15 mag. The majority of SEY and
sAGN (strong AGNs) are associated with luminous late-type (or S0a) galaxies,
while LIN (weak AGNs) and RET (""retired""), are mostly found among E/S0as. The
number density of AGNs, HII region-like, and retired galaxies is found to
anti-correlate with the local density of galaxies, such that their frequency
drops by a factor of two near the cluster cores, while the frequency of
galaxies containing passive nuclei increases by the same amount towards the
center of rich clusters. The dependence of AGN number density on the local
galaxy density is greater than the one implied by morphology segregation alone.

  Ramsey-type problem",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Until recently, techniques for obtaining lower bounds for kernelization were
one of the most sought after tools in the field of parameterized complexity.
Now, after a strong influx of techniques, we are in the fortunate situation of
having tools available that are even stronger than what has been required in
their applications so far. Based on a result of Fortnow and Santhanam (JCSS
2011), Bodlaender et al. (JCSS 2009) showed that, unless NP \subseteq
coNP/poly, the existence of a deterministic polynomial-time composition
algorithm, i.e., an algorithm which outputs an instance of bounded parameter
value which is yes if and only if one of t input instances is yes, rules out
the existence of polynomial kernels for a problem. Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC
2010) continued this line of research and, amongst others, were able to rule
out kernels of size O(k^d-eps) for certain problems, assuming NP !\subseteq
coNP/poly. Their work implies that even the existence of a co-nondeterministic
composition rules out polynomial kernels.
  In this work we present the first example of how co-nondeterminism can help
to make a composition algorithm. We study a Ramsey-type problem: Given a graph
G and an integer k, the question is whether G contains an independent set or a
clique of size at least k. It was asked by Rod Downey whether this problem
admits a polynomial kernelization. We provide a co-nondeterministic composition
based on embedding t instances into a single host graph H. The crux is that the
host graph H needs to observe a bound of L \in O(log t) on both its maximum
independent set and maximum clique size, while also having a cover of its
vertex set by independent sets and cliques all of size L; the
co-nondeterministic composition is build around the search for such graphs.
Thus we show that, unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly, the problem does not admit a
kernelization with polynomial size guarantee.

we show that Hamiltonian for the perturbation variables is not bounded from

against perturbations. This gives a strong limit on a phenomenological
gravitational model which violates parity. We also provide a necessary and
sufficient condition for the theory to belong to a special class in which no
such instability occurs. For such theories, the number of propagating modes for
$\ell \ge 2$ is three, one from the odd and the other two from the even. Unlike
in the case of $f(R)$ theories, those modes are coupled each other, which can
be used as a distinctive feature to test the parity violating theories from
observations. All the modes propagate at the speed of light. No-ghost condition
and no-tachyon condition are the same as those in $f(R)$ theories. For the
dipole perturbations, the odd and the even modes completely decouple. The odd
mode gives a slowly-rotating BH solution whose metric is linearized in its
angular momentum. We provide an integral expression of such a solution. On the
other hand, the even mode propagates at the speed of light. For the monopole
perturbation, in addition to a mode which just shifts the mass of the
background BH, there is also one even mode that propagates at the speed of

strongly affect isospin diffusion, most notably the cross sections and cluster
production. In addition, there is a difference in the calculated isospin

high-redshift galaxies is a major observational challenge that will be
addressed over the coming years with a new generation of radio telescopes. We
investigate this important issue by considering the states of hydrogen across a
range of structures within high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations. Additionally, our simulations allow us to investigate the
sensitivity of our results to numerical resolution and to sub-grid baryonic
physics (especially feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei). We
find that the most significant uncertainty in modelling the neutral hydrogen
distribution arises from our need to model a self-shielding correction in
moderate density regions. Future simulations incorporating radiative transfer
schemes will be vital to improve on our empirical self-shielding threshold.
Irrespective of the exact nature of the threshold we find that while the atomic
hydrogen mass function evolves only mildly from redshift two to zero, the
molecular hydrogen mass function increases with increasing redshift, especially
at the high-mass end. Interestingly, the weak evolution of the neutral hydrogen
mass function is insensitive to the feedback scheme utilised, but the opposite
is true for the molecular gas, which is more closely associated with the star
formation in the simulations.

background. By integrating over the lifetime of the galaxy one might be able to
see the effect of NCB processes as a slightly eschewed abundance ratio of
selected beta-decaying nuclei. First, the candidates must be chosen so that
both the mother and daughter nuclei have a lifetime comparable to that of the
Milky Way or the signal could be easily washed out by additional decays.
Secondly, relic neutrinos have so low energy that their de Broglie wavelengths
are macroscopic and they may therefore scatter coherently on the electronic
cloud of the candidate atoms. One must therefore compare the cross sections for
the two processes (induced beta-decay by neutrino capture, and coherent
scattering of the neutrinos on atomic nuclei) before drawing any conclusions.
Finally, the density of target nuclei in the galaxy must be calculated. We
assume supernovae as the only production source and approximate the neutrino
density as a homogenous background. Here we perform the full calculation for
187-Re and 138-La and find that one needs abundance measurements with 24 digit
precision in order to detect the effect of relic neutrinos. Or alternatively an
enhancement of of the relic neutrino density by a factor of $10^{15}$ to

law $SFE$ $\sim \rho_s^{1/2}$ expected in the theoretical model of
self-regulated star formation proposed by Ostriker et al.\cite{OstrikerAll10}.
The alternative explanation is to propose that $SFE$ is proportional to a
frequency of vertical oscillation of gas clouds around the disc midplane. In
the most rarified regions of LSB galaxies the efficiency of star formation is
nearly independent on gas and stellar disc densities being higher in the mean
than it is expected from the extrapolation of the power law fit for HSB sample
galaxies. Evidently in these regions with extremely low $\rho_{g}$ SFE depends
on local density fluctuations rather than on the azimuthally averaged disc
parameters.

  Our algorithms in the interactive setting are achieved by revisiting the
problem of releasing differentially private, approximate answers to a large

problem fall into the same basic framework, and are based on the existence of
objects which we call iterative database construction algorithms. We give a new
generic framework in which new (efficient) IDC algorithms give rise to new
(efficient) interactive private query release mechanisms. Our modular analysis
simplifies and tightens the analysis of previous algorithms, leading to
improved bounds. We then give a new IDC algorithm (and therefore a new private,
interactive query release mechanism) based on the Frieze/Kannan low-rank matrix
decomposition. This new release mechanism gives an improvement on prior work in
a range of parameters where the size of the database is comparable to the size
of the data universe (such as releasing all cut queries on dense graphs).
  We also give a non-interactive algorithm for efficiently releasing private
synthetic data for graph cuts with error O(|V|^{1.5}). Our algorithm is based
on randomized response and a non-private implementation of the SDP-based,
constant-factor approximation algorithm for cut-norm due to Alon and Naor.
Finally, we give a reduction based on the IDC framework showing that an
efficient, private algorithm for computing sufficiently accurate rank-1 matrix
approximations would lead to an improved efficient algorithm for releasing
private synthetic data for graph cuts. We leave finding such an algorithm as
our main open problem.

scheduling jobs in parallel and distributed platforms. It is inherently
centralized. However, with the increasing number of processors, the cost for
managing a single centralized list becomes too prohibitive. A suitable approach
to reduce the contention is to distribute the list among the computational
units: each processor has only a local view of the work to execute. Thus, the
scheduler is no longer greedy and standard performance guarantees are lost.
  The objective of this work is to study the extra cost that must be paid when
the list is distributed among the computational units. We first present a
general methodology for computing the expected makespan based on the analysis
of an adequate potential function which represents the load unbalance between
the local lists. We obtain an equation on the evolution of the potential by
computing its expected decrease in one step of the schedule. Our main theorem
shows how to solve such equations to bound the makespan. Then, we apply this
method to several scheduling problems, namely, for unit independent tasks, for
weighted independent tasks and for tasks with precendence constraints. More
precisely, we prove that the time for scheduling a global workload W composed
of independent unit tasks on m processors is equal to W/m plus an additional
term proportional to log_2 W. We provide a lower bound which shows that this is
optimal up to a constant. This result is extended to the case of weighted
independent tasks. In the last setting, precedence task graphs, our analysis
leads to an improvement on the bound of Arora et al. We finally provide some
experiments using a simulator. The distribution of the makespan is shown to fit
existing probability laws. The additive term is shown by simulation to be
around 3 \log_2 W confirming the tightness of our analysis.

Comparison and analysis show that the accuracy and checkerboard problems are
caused by the order of the sound speed being too large and too small in the
coefficients of the velocity-derivative and pressure-derivative dissipation
terms, respectively. These problems can be resolved by choosing coefficients
with zero-order sound speed. In addition, to avoid the negative effects of the
global cut-off strategy on accuracy while maintaining computational stability,
the sound speed terms in the numerator of the coefficients can be determined by
local variables, while those in the denominator remain the global cut-off. Two

applied to construct more satisfactory schemes for all-speed flows. Asymptotic

the RHIC and LHC energies within the hydrokinetic model (HKM). The hydrokinetic
predictions for the HBT radii at LHC energies are compared with the recent
results of the ALICE Collaboration. The role of non-equilibrium and

where a computable bound on the use function is explicitly specified. This
elaboration enables us to deal with the notion of asymptotic behavior in a
manner like in computational complexity theory, while staying in computability
theory. We apply the elaboration to sets which appear in the statistical
mechanical interpretation of algorithmic information theory. We demonstrate the
power of the elaboration by revealing a critical phenomenon, i.e., a phase
transition, in the statistical mechanical interpretation, which cannot be
captured by the original notion of weak truth-table reducibility.

extensively observed so far. Nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open in
the literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the GRB environment. In
particular, GRB 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic halo
environment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and the
non-detection of an underlying host galaxy. In this work we collect all
publicly available data and address these issues by modelling the NIR-to-X-ray
spectral energy distribution (SED) and studying the high signal-to-noise
VLT/FORS afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of GRB
absorbers. The SED reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the UV, low
equivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a LMC- or
SMC-type extinction curve. From the weak MgII absorption at z=1.5477 in the
spectrum, we derived logN(MgII)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ionic
column density of several metals. These suggest that the GRB absorber is most
likely an LLS with a 0.03Z\odot<Z<1.3Z\odot metallicity. The comparison with
other GRB absorbers places GRB070125 at the low end of the absorption line
equivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features and
spectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.
Moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surrounding
the GRB, combined with a low N(HI) along a short segment of the line of sight
within the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in GRB070125.
Finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faint
GRB host galaxy, well within the GRB host brightness distribution. Thus, the
possibility that GRB070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,
massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems more
likely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

first study here in some detail the effects of small pressure perturbations in
an otherwise pressure-free collapse scenario, and examine how a collapse
evolution that was going to the black hole endstate would be modified and go to
a naked singularity, once small pressures are introduced in the initial data.
This allows us to understand the distribution of black holes and naked
singularities in the initial data space. Collapse is examined in terms of the
evolutions allowed by Einstein equations, under suitable physical conditions
and as evolving from a regular initial data. We then show that both black holes
and naked singularities are generic outcomes of a complete collapse, when
genericity is defined in a suitable sense in an appropriate space.

acting by isometries on a product of CAT(-1)-spaces, the probably most

product $F_\Gamma\times P_\Gamma$, where $F_\Gamma\subseteq\rand_1\times

this construction to obtain measures supported in each $\Gamma$-invariant
subset of the regular limit set and investigate their properties. Finally we

Zitterbewegung} (ZB) phenomenon, for the relativistic electron wave packets,
which are a superposition of the states with quantum numbers sharply peaked
around some level $n_0$ of the order of few tens. The probability densities as
well as average velocities of the packet center and the average spin components
were calculated analytically and visualized. Our computations demonstrate that
due to dephasing of the states for times larger than the cyclotron period the
initial wave packet (which includes the states with the positive energy only)
loses the spatial localization so that the evolution can no longer be described
classically. However, at the half-revival time $t=T_R/2$ its reshaping takes
place firstly. The behavior of the wave packet containing the states of both
energy bands (with $E_n>0$ and $E_n<0$) is more complicated. At short times of
a few classical periods such packet splits into two parts which rotate with
cyclotron frequency in the opposite directions and meet each other every
one-half of the cyclotron period. At these moments their wave functions have
significant overlap that leads to ZB. At the time of fractional revival each of
two sub-packets is decomposed into few packets-fractions. However, at $t=T_R$
each of the two sub-packets (with positive or negative energy) restores at
various points of the cyclotron orbit, that makes it impossible reshaping of
initial wave packet entirely unlike the wave packet which consists of states
with energies $E_n>0$ only. Obtained results can be useful for the description
of electromagnetic radiation and absorption in relativistic plasma on
astrophysics objects, where super high magnetic field has the value of the
order $10^8-10^9$T, as well as for interpretation of experiments with trapped
