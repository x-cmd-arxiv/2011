analytic expressions for all three observables in terms of hyperelliptic
integrals and Lauricella's $F_D$ function. For an interpretation of these
analytical expressions, we perform a post-Schwarzschild and a post-Newton

  We introduce a notion of 2-signature: such a signature specifies not only the
terms of a language, but also reduction rules on those terms. To any
2-signature $S$ we associate a category of ""models"" of $S$. This category has
an initial object, which integrates the terms freely generated by $S$, and
which is equipped with reductions according to the inequations given in $S$. We
call this initial object the language generated by $S$. Models of a
2--signature are built from relative monads and modules over such monads.
Through the use of monads, the models---and in particular, the initial
model---come equipped with a substitution operation that is compatible with
reduction in a suitable sense.
  The initiality theorem is formalized in the proof assistant Coq, yielding a
machinery which, when fed with a 2-signature, provides the associated
programming language with reduction relation and certified substitution.

encountered nearby structures after several minutes of stretching, and a
well-defined elongated shape of a GLF faded away. Magnetograms from SDO/HMI and

flux emergence, and their disappearance is related to magnetic cancellation.

strong enough to produce cored dark matter profiles in low-mass galaxies. The
individual star formation rates and the co-moving number density (3.7x10^-4

of HD+ ions in the vibrational ground state is measured using the photocathode
electron target at the heavy-ion storage ring TSR. Rydberg resonances
associated with ro-vibrational excitation of the HD+ core are scanned as a
function of the electron collision energy with an instrumental broadening below
1 meV in the low-energy limit. The measurement is compared to calculations
using multichannel quantum defect theory, accounting for rotational structure
and interactions and considering the six lowest rotational energy levels as
initial ionic states. Using thermal equilibrium level populations at 300 K to
approximate the experimental conditions, close correspondence between
calculated and measured structures is found up to the first vibrational
excitation threshold of the cations near 0.24 eV. Detailed assignments,
including naturally broadened and overlapping Rydberg resonances, are performed
for all structures up to 0.024 eV. Resonances from purely rotational excitation
of the ion core are found to have similar strengths as those involving
vibrational excitation. A dominant low-energy resonance is assigned to
contributions from excited rotational states only. The results indicate strong
modifications in the energy dependence of the dissociative recombination rate
coefficient through the rotational excitation of the parent ions, and underline
the need for studies with rotationally cold species to obtain results

Multiextremal constraints can lead to complex feasible regions being

is considered where the order the constraints are evaluated is fixed by the
nature of the problem and a constraint $i$ is defined only over the set where
the constraint $i-1$ is satisfied. The objective function is defined only over

anti-ferromagnetically regardless of the Co concentration with the spin
re-orientation from the a-axis in the parent compound toward c-axis with the
increasing replacement of iron by cobalt. The re-orientation takes place close
to the a-c plane. Some trivalent europium appears in EuFe(2-x)Co(x)As2 versus
substitution due to the chemical pressure induced by Co-atoms and it
experiences some transferred hyperfine field from Eu2+. Iron experiences some
transferred field due to the europium ordering for substituted samples in the

characterize the morphology of synthetic multifractal rough surfaces, which are
generated by multiplicative hierarchical cascading processes. To this end, two
different classes of multifractal rough surfaces are numerically simulated. As
the first group, singular measure multifractal rough surfaces are generated by
using the $p$ model. The smoothened multifractal rough surface then is
simulated by convolving the first group with a so-called Hurst exponent, $H^*$
. The generalized multifractal dimension of isoheight lines (contours), $D(q)$,
correlation exponent of contours, $x_l$, cumulative distributions of areas,
$\xi$, and perimeters, $\eta$, are calculated for both synthetic multifractal
rough surfaces. Our results show that for both mentioned classes, hyperscaling
relations for contour loops are the same as that of monofractal systems. In
contrast to singular measure multifractal rough surfaces, $H^*$ plays a leading
role in smoothened multifractal rough surfaces. All computed geometrical
exponents for the first class depend not only on its Hurst exponent but also on
the set of $p$ values. But in spite of multifractal nature of smoothened
surfaces (second class), the corresponding geometrical exponents are controlled
by $H^*$, the same as what happens for monofractal rough surfaces.

relatively simple but general method to compute thermodynamic and thermal
properties of any crystal. First, from the harmonic, cubic, and quartic force
constants we construct a force field for molecular dynamics (MD). It is exact
in the limit of small atomic displacements and thus does not suffer from
inaccuracies inherent in semi-empirical potentials such as Stillinger-Weber's.
By using the Green-Kubo (GK) formula and molecular dynamics simulations, we
extract the bulk thermal conductivity. This method is accurate at high
temperatures where three-phonon processes need to be included to higher orders,
but may suffer from size scaling issues. Next, we use perturbation theory
(Fermi Golden rule) to extract the phonon lifetimes and compute the thermal
conductivity $\kappa$ from the relaxation time approximation. This method is
valid at most temperatures, but will overestimate $\kappa$ at very high
temperatures, where higher order processes neglected in our calculations, also
contribute. As a test, these methods are applied to bulk crystalline silicon,
and the results are compared and differences discussed in more detail. The
presented methodology paves the way for a systematic approach to model heat
transport in solids using multiscale modeling, in which the relaxation time due
to anharmonic 3-phonon processes is calculated quantitatively, in addition to
the usual harmonic properties such as phonon frequencies and group velocities.
It also allows the construction of accurate bulk interatomic potentials

cancel in (Bessel-) weighted asymmetries. Also, the resulting compact

ground state of the system, is characterized by the effective inter-band
orbital interactions which are barely present in the AA. Their vanishing
induces electronic decoupling between the graphene layers, so that the bonding
interaction $\Delta E_{oi}$ between the flakes is drastically reduced from
-0.482 eV to -0.087 eV as the stacking pattern is changed from AB to AA. The
effective way to improve the bonding interaction between layers preserving the
same AA lattice order is to induce rotation of the layer. As the flake is
rotated, the bonding interactions are improved mostly due to suppression of the
Pauli repulsion which in turn increases the interlayer orbital interactions,
while the inter-band part of those remain negligible on the whole range of the
rotation angle. The Pauli repulsion is also found to be the main force moving
apart two fragments as the stacking pattern is changed from AA to AB. This
enhances the equilibrium interlayer distance, which for the AA staking is
larger than the established value for the AB stacking (3.4 A)

magnitude and shape of the pulse profile in narrow spectral bands, we have been
able to constrain the physical characteristics and geometrical parameters of
the system: the two angles that the line of sight and the spin axis make with
respect to the warm spot axis (\psi\ and \xi\ respectively), the angular size
of the spot, and the overall surface temperature distribution. Our modeling
accounts for the general relativistic effects of gravitational redshift and
light bending near the stellar surface, and allows for local anisotropic
emission. We found that the surface temperature distribution on the neutron
star is consistent with the expectations of a dipole magnetic field
configuration; the local radiation requires a pencil-beamed emission pattern,
suggesting the presence of a magnetized atmosphere. For a typical value of the
radius, R=13 km, the viewing parameters (symmetric for an interchange between
\psi\ and \xi), range from \psi=\xi=38 deg to (\psi,\xi)=(52 deg, 29 deg).

than an order of magnitude greater (indicating higher incidence of nuclear
activity). The clumpy dust mass residing in large-scale features is estimated,
using the SDSS r-band images, to be 10^{4.5}-10^{6.5} MSun. A comparison to the
total (clumpy + diffuse) dust masses- calculated using the far-IR fluxes of 15%
of the D-ETGs that are detected by the IRAS- indicates that only ~20% of the
dust resides in these large-scale features. The dust masses are several times
larger than the maximum value expected from stellar mass loss, ruling out an
internal origin. The dust content shows no correlation with the blue
luminosity, indicating that it is not related to a galactic scale cooling flow.
No correlation is found with the age of the recent starburst, suggesting that
the dust is accreted directly in the merger rather than being produced in situ
by the triggered star formation. Using molecular gas-to-dust ratios of ETGs in
the literature we estimate that the median current and initial molecular gas
fraction are ~1.3% and ~4%, respectively. Recent work suggests that the merger
activity in nearby ETGs largely involves minor mergers (mass ratios between
1:10 and 1:4). If the IRAS-detected D-ETGs form via this channel, then the
original gas fractions of the accreted satellites are 20%-44%. [Abridged]

associated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of
1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dust
extinction in the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities with the recently
discovered GRB 110328A / Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw J1644+57), we suggest that
Sw J2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outbursts
resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. If
so, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate of
tidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowly
collimated (theta < 1 degree), or only a small fraction of tidal disruptions
generate relativistic ejecta. Analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-ray
bursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the black
hole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component.
Alternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus
[AGN]), Sw J2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in these
sources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with known
classes of AGNs capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies).

subtraction techniques to remove the high stellar density background. Fourteen
of the detections were previously unknown trans-Neptunian objects,
demonstrating that the southern sky had not been well-searched to date for
bright outer solar system objects. Assuming moderate albedos, several of the
new discoveries from this survey could be in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus
be considered dwarf planets. Combining this survey with previous surveys from
the northern hemisphere suggests that the Kuiper Belt is nearly complete to
around 21st magnitude in the R-band. All the main dynamical classes in the
Kuiper Belt are occupied by at least one dwarf planet sized object. The 3:2
Neptune resonance, which is the innermost well-populated Neptune resonance, has
several large objects while the main outer Neptune resonances such as the 5:3,
7:4, 2:1, and 5:2 do not appear have any large objects. This indicates that the
outer resonances are either significantly depleted in objects relative to the
3:2 resonance or have a significantly different assortment of objects than the
3:2 resonance. For the largest objects (H<4.5 mag), the scattered disk
population appears to have a few times more objects than the main Kuiper Belt
population, while the Sedna population could be several times more than that of
the main Kuiper Belt.

local early-type galaxies exhibiting dust features. We use optical and radio
data to examine the nature of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in these
objects, and compare these with a carefully constructed control sample. We find
that dust lane early-type galaxies are much more likely to host emission-line
AGN than the control sample galaxies. Moreover, there is a strong correlation
between radio and emission-line AGN activity in dust lane early-types, but not
the control sample. Dust lane early-type galaxies show the same distribution of
AGN properties in rich and poor environments, suggesting a similar triggering
mechanism. By contrast, this is not the case for early-types with no dust
features. These findings strongly suggest that dust lane early-type galaxies
are starburst systems formed in gas-rich mergers. Further evidence in support
of this scenario is provided by enhanced star formation and black hole
accretion rates in these objects. Dust lane early-types therefore represent an
evolutionary stage between starbursting and quiescent galaxies. In these
objects, the AGN has already been triggered but has not as yet completely
destroyed the gas reservoir required for star formation.

central-satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution,
with a strong break at SSFR ~ 10^-11 yr^-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no
regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the `green valley'. Satellite
galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched (`red sequence') side of
the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess
above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An
enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses
down to 3 x 10^11 Msol and increases strongly with halo mass and toward halo
center. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond ~2R_vir
around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals
and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant
environmental effects until they cross within ~R_vir of a more massive host
halo, (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve
in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyrs, and (3) once
begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results place
strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we will
discuss further in companion papers.

several radio continuum sources, one of which is IRS1, a high-mass protostar,
from which a 0.3 pc molecular bipolar outflow was detected. Several maser
species have been detected around IRS1. The CH3OH masers have been suggested to
trace a Keplerian-disk, while the H2O masers are almost aligned to the outflow.
More recent results suggested that the region hosts a torus and potentially a
disk, but with a different inclination than the Keplerian-disk that is supposed
to be traced by the CH3OH masers. Tracing the magnetic field close to
protostars is fundamental for determining the orientation of the disk/torus.
Recent studies showed that during the protostellar phase of high-mass star
formation the magnetic field is oriented along the outflows and around or on
the surfaces of the disk/torus. The observations of polarized maser emissions
at milliarcsecond resolution can make a crucial contribution to understanding
the orientation of the magnetic field and, consequently, the orientation of the
disk/torus in NGC7538-IRS1. The NRAO Very Long Baseline Array was used to
measure the linear polarization and the Zeeman-splitting of the 22GHz H2O
masers toward NGC7538-IRS1. The European VLBI Network and the MERLIN telescopes

CH3OH masers at high angular resolution. We detected linear polarization
emission toward two H2O masers and toward twenty CH3OH masers. The CH3OH
masers, most of which only show a core structure, seem to trace rotating and
potentially infalling gas in the inner part of a torus. Significant
Zeeman-splitting was measured in three CH3OH masers. [...] We also propose a
new description of the structure of the NGC7538-IRS1 maser region.

is high for a globular cluster so far from the Galactic center, but is low for
a typical open cluster. The [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, though in agreement with the
Galactic stars within the $1\sigma$ errors, agree best with the lower values in
dwarf galaxies. No signs of the Na/O anticorrelation are detected in Pal 1,
though Na appears to be marginally high in all four stars. Pal 1's neutron
capture elements are also unusual: its high [Ba/Y] ratio agrees best with dwarf
galaxies, implying an excess of second-peak over first-peak s-process elements,
while its [Eu/$\alpha$] and [Ba/Eu] ratios show that Pal 1's contributions from
the r-process must have differed in some way from normal Galactic stars.
Therefore, Pal 1 is chemically unusual, as well in its other properties. Pal 1
shares some of its unusual abundance characteristics with the young clusters
associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy remnant and the intermediate-age
LMC clusters, and could be chemically associated with the Canis Majoris

characterizing the statistical properties of magnetic activity cycles, and
studying their impact on spectroscopic measurements such as radial velocities,
line bisectors and line shapes. Methods. We use data from the HARPS
high-precision planet-search sample comprising 304 FGK stars followed over
about 7 years. We obtain high-precision Ca II H&K chromospheric activity
measurements and convert them to R'HK indices using an updated calibration
taking into account stellar metallicity. We study R'HK variability as a
function of time and search for possible correlations with radial velocities
and line shape parameters. Results. We classify stars according to the
magnitude and timescale of the Ca II H&K variability, and identify activity
cycles whenever possible. We find that 39+/-8% of old solar-type stars in the
solar neighborhood do not show any activity cycles (or only very weak ones),
while 61+/-8% do have one. Non-cycling stars are almost only found among G
dwarfs and at mean activity levels log R'HK < -4.95. Magnetic cycle amplitude
generally decreases with decreasing activity level. A significant fraction of
stars exhibit small variations in radial velocities and line shape parameters
that are correlated with activity cycles. The sensitivity of radial velocities
to magnetic cycles increases towards hotter stars, while late K dwarfs are
almost insensitive. Conclusions. Activity cycles do induce long-period,
low-amplitude radial velocity variations, at levels up to ~25 m/s. Caution is
therefore mandatory when searching for long-period exoplanets. However, these
effects can be corrected to high precision by detrending the radial velocity

employed to study the free vibration characteristics of functionally graded
material (FGM) plates subjected to thermal environment. Temperature field is
assumed to be a uniform distribution over the plate surface and varied in the
thickness direction. The material is assumed to be temperature dependent and
graded in the thickness direction according to the power-law distribution in
terms of volume fractions of the constituents. The effective material
properties are estimated from the volume fractions and the material properties
of the constituents using Mori-Tanaka homogenization method. The nonlinear
governing equations obtained using Lagrange's equations of motion are solved
using finite element procedure coupled with the direct iteration technique. The
variation of nonlinear frequency ratio with amplitude is highlighted
considering various parameters such as gradient index, temperature, thickness
and aspect ratios, and skew angle. For the numerical illustrations, silicon
nitride/stainless steel is considered as functionally graded material. The
results obtained here reveal that the temperature field and gradient index have
significant effect on the nonlinear vibration of the functionally graded plate.

that for every vertex v, the edges of the tree that are adjacent to v satisfy a
given family of constraints. A famous example thereof is the classical
degree-constrained MST problem, where for every vertex v, a simple upper bound
on the degree is imposed. Iterative rounding/relaxation algorithms became the
tool of choice for degree-bounded network design problems. A cornerstone for
this development was the work of Singh and Lau, who showed for the
degree-bounded MST problem how to find a spanning tree violating each degree
bound by at most one unit and with cost at most the cost of an optimal solution
that respects the degree bounds.
  However, current iterative rounding approaches face several limits when
dealing with more general degree constraints. In particular, when several
constraints are imposed on the edges adjacent to a vertex v, as for example
when a partition of the edges adjacent to v is given and only a fixed number of
elements can be chosen out of each set of the partition, current approaches
might violate each of the constraints by a constant, instead of violating all
constraints together by at most a constant number of edges. Furthermore, it is
also not clear how previous iterative rounding approaches can be used for
degree constraints where some edges are in a super-constant number of
constraints.
  We extend iterative rounding/relaxation approaches both on a conceptual level
as well as aspects involving their analysis to address these limitations. This
leads to an efficient algorithm for the degree-constrained MST problem where
for every vertex v, the edges adjacent to v have to be independent in a given
matroid. The algorithm returns a spanning tree T of cost at most OPT, such that
for every vertex v, it suffices to remove at most 8 edges from T to satisfy the
matroidal degree constraint at v.

re-analysed by introducing a black hole's effective temperature which takes

can be written as a superposition of the empirical measures of a family of
finite cycles. This identifies a convex set of models. We discuss the problem
of characterization of cyclic random walks in some special cases showing that
it is related to several remarkable and classical results. In particular we
introduce the notion of balanced measure and show that a translation invariant
random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$ is cyclic if and only if its transition
probability is balanced. The characterization of the extremal elements is
obtained using the Carath\'{e}odory's Theorem of convex analysis. We then show
that a random walk on a finite set is cyclic if and only if at every vertex the
outgoing flux of the transition graph is equal to the ingoing flux. The
extremal elements are characterized by the Birkhoff-Von-Neumann Theorem.
Finally we consider the discrete torus and discuss when the cyclic
decomposition can be done using only homotopically trivial cycles or elementary
cycles associated to edges and two dimensional faces. While in one dimension
this is equivalent to require some geometric properties of a discrete vector
field associated to the transition rates, in two dimension this is not the
case. In particular we give a simple characterization of the polyhedron of the
rates admitting a cyclic decomposition with elementary cycles. The proof is
based on a discrete Hodge decomposition, elementary homological algebra and the
Helly's Theorem of convex analysis. Finally we discuss a natural discretization
procedure of smooth divergence free continuous vector fields and an application
to random walks in random environments.

applications of phylogenetic inference. Several approaches exist to account for
this feature but they do not usually enable the investigator to pinpoint the
sites that evolve under one or another rate of evolution in a straightforward
manner. The focus is on Bayesian phylogenetic mixture models, augmented with
allocation variables, as tools for site classification and quantification of
classification uncertainty. The method does not rely on prior knowledge of site
membership to classes or even the number of classes. Furthermore, it does not
require correlated sites to be next to one another in the sequence alignment,
unlike some phylogenetic hidden Markov or change-point models. In the approach
presented, model selection on the number and type of mixture components is
conducted ahead of both model estimation and site classification; the
steppingstone sampler (SS) is used to select amongst competing mixture models.
Example applications of simulated data and mitochondrial DNA of primates
illustrate site classification via 'augmented' Bayesian phylogenetic mixtures.
In both examples, all mixtures outperform commonly-used models of among-site
rate variation and models that do not account for rate heterogeneity. The
examples further demonstrate how site classification is readily available from
the analysis output. The method is directly relevant to the choice of
partitions in Bayesian phylogenetics, and its application may lead to the
discovery of structure not otherwise recognised in a molecular sequence
alignment. Computational aspects of Bayesian phylogenetic model estimation are
discussed, including the use of simple Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) moves
that mix efficiently without tempering the chains.

delta_v. We find nine HCO+ 3-2 line profiles with a significant blue asymmetry

results to HCN 3-2 observations from Wu et al. (2003, 2010), we find that eight
of the blue and three of red have profiles with the same asymmetry in HCN. The
eight sources with blue asymmetries in both tracers are considered strong
candidates for inflow. Quantitative measures of the asymmetry (e.g. delta_v)
tend to be larger for HCN. This, combined with possible HCO+ abundance
enhancements in outflows, suggests that HCN may be a better tracer of inflow.

that has been reported by ourselves and others. Several new figures of merit
for evaluating exploration strategies are proposed and compared. Using concepts
from differential topology and information theory, we develop the theoretical
foundation of search strategies aimed at rapid discovery of topological
features (locations of critical points and critical level sets) of a priori
unknown differentiable random fields. The theory enables study of efficient
reconnaissance strategies in which the tradeoff between speed and accuracy can
be understood. The proposed approach to rapid discovery of topological features
has led in a natural way to to the creation of parsimonious reconnaissance
routines that do not rely on any prior knowledge of the environment. The design
of topology-guided search protocols uses a mathematical framework that
quantifies the relationship between what is discovered and what remains to be
discovered. The quantification rests on an information theory inspired model
whose properties allow us to treat search as a problem in optimal information
acquisition. A central theme in this approach is that ""conservative"" and
""aggressive"" search strategies can be precisely defined, and search decisions
regarding ""exploration"" vs. ""exploitation"" choices are informed by the rate at
which the information metric is changing.

Order Gravity adding also the Dark Matter component. The Fourth Order Gravity
is a Lagrangian containing the Ricci scalar, the Ricci and Riemann tensor, but
the rotation curves are depending only on two free parameters. A systematic
analysis of rotation curves, in the Newtonian Limit of theory, induced by all
galactic sub-structures of ordinary matter is shown. This analysis is presented
for Fourth Order Gravity with and without Dark Matter. The outcomes are
compared with respect to classical outcomes of General Relativity. The
gravitational potential of point-like mass is the usual potential corrected by
two Yukawa terms. The rotation curve is higher or also lower than curve of
General Relativity if in the Lagrangian the Ricci scalar square is dominant or
not with respect to the contribution of the Ricci tensor square. The curves are
compared with the experimental data for the Milky Way and the galaxy NGC 3198.
Although the Fourth Order Gravity gives more rotational contributions, in the
limit of large distances the Keplerian behavior is present, and it is missing
if we add a Dark Matter component. By modifying the theory of Gravitation
consequently also the spatial description of Dark Matter could undergo a
modification. At last we compare the gravitational potential by Fourth Order
Gravity with respect to more used potential induced by power law of Ricci
scalar.

stellar masses derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting as
functions of various empirical and theoretical assumptions. Using large samples
consisting of 40,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, of which 5,000
are also in the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, with spectroscopic redshifts in
the range 0.05 \leq z \leq 0.095, we test the reliability of some commonly used
stellar population models and extinction laws for computing stellar masses.
Spectroscopic ages (t), metallicities (Z), and extinctions (A) are also
computed from fits to SDSS spectra using various population models. These
constraints are used in additional tests to estimate the systematic errors in
the stellar masses derived from SED fitting, where t, Z, and A are typically
left as free parameters. We find reasonable agreement in mass estimates among
stellar population models, with variation of the IMF and extinction law
yielding systematic biases on the mass of nearly a factor of 2, in agreement
with other studies. Removing the near-infrared bands changes the statistical
bias in mass by only 0.06 dex, adding uncertainties of 0.1 dex at the 95% CL.
In contrast, we find that removing an ultraviolet band is more critical,
introducing 2{\sigma} uncertainties of 0.15 dex. Finally, we find that stellar
masses are less affected by absence of metallicity and/or dust extinction
knowledge. However, there is a definite systematic offset in the mass estimate
when the stellar population age is unknown, up to a factor of 2.5 for very old
(12 Gyr) stellar populations. We present the stellar masses for our sample,
corrected for the measured systematic biases due to photometrically determined
ages, finding that age errors produce lower stellar masses by 0.15 dex, with
errors of 0.02 dex at the 95% CL for the median stellar age subsample.

some form of tree traversal. SRAM-based Pipelining can improve the throughput
dramatically. However, previous pipelining schemes result in unbalanced memory
allocation over the pipeline stages. This has been identified as a major
challenge for scalable pipelined solutions. This paper proposes a flexible
bidirectional linear pipeline architecture based on widely-used dual-port
SRAMs. A search tree is partitioned, and then mapped onto pipeline stages by a
bidirectional fine-grained mapping scheme. We introduce the notion of inversion
factor and several heuristics to invert subtrees for memory balancing. Due to
its linear structure, the architecture maintains packet input order, and
supports non-blocking route updates. Our experiments show that, the
architecture can achieve a perfectly balanced memory distribution over the
pipeline stages, for both trie-based IP lookup and tree-based multi-dimensional
packet classification. For IP lookup, it can store a full backbone routing
table with 154419 entries using 2MB of memory, and sustain a high throughput of
1.87 billion packets per second (GPPS), i.e. 0.6 Tbps for the minimum size (40
bytes) packets. The throughput can be improved further to be 2.4 Tbps, by
employing caching to exploit the Internet traffic locality.

these analytic results, we discuss astrometric image centroid displacements due
to gravitational microlensing by the Ellis wormhole. The astrometric image
centroid trajectory by the Ellis wormhole is different from the standard one by
a spherical lensing object that is expressed by the Schwarzschild metric. The
anomalous shift of the image centroid by the Ellis wormhole lens is smaller
than that by the Schwarzschild lens, provided that the impact parameter and the
Einstein ring radius are the same. Therefore, the lensed image centroid by the
Ellis wormhole moves slower. Such a difference, though it is very small, will
be in principle applicable for detecting or constraining the Ellis wormhole by
using future high-precision astrometry observations. In particular, the image
centroid position gives us an additional information, so that the parameter
degeneracy existing in photometric microlensing can be partially broken. The
anomalous shift reaches the order of a few micro arcsec. if our galaxy hosts a
wormhole with throat radius larger than $10^5$ km. When the source moves
tangentially to the Einstein ring for instance, the maximum position shift of
the image centroid by the Ellis wormhole is 0.18 normalized by the Einstein

structural similarities to other ensembles of constraint satisfaction problems,
such as $k$-satisfiability ($k$-SAT), hypergraph bicoloring and graph coloring.

the set of solutions shatters into an exponential number of well-separated

the clustering threshold is sharp and determine its exact location. We prove
that the set of solutions has large conductance below this threshold and that
each of the clusters has large conductance above the same threshold. Our proof
constructs a very sparse basis for the set of solutions (or the subset within a

direct photon contributions from different sources (QGP radiation, hard

ranges. Low momentum direct photons are dominated by thermal radiation (both
from the QGP and hadron gas), while high momentum direct photons dominantly

young infrared (IR) galaxies. Five extinction curves, namely, the Milky Way
(MW), the pseudo MW which is MW-like without the 2175 Angstrom feature, the
Calzetti, and two SN dust curves, are applied to the data, by combining with
various dust distributions, namely, the uniform dust screen, the clumpy dust
screen, the internal dust geometry, and the composite geometry with a
combination of dust screen and internal dust. Employing a minimum chi square
method, we find that the foreground dust screen geometry, especially combined
with the 8 - 40 M_sun SN extinction curve, provides a good approximation to the
real dust geometry, whereas internal dust is only significant in 2 galaxies.
The SN extinction curves, which are flatter than the others, reproduce the data
of 8(67%) galaxies better. Dust masses are estimated to be in excess of ~ 10^8
M_sun. Inferred ages of the galaxies are very young, 8 of which range from 10

that determines the efficiency and fairness of wireless spectrum allocation. At
one extreme, greedy opportunistic scheduling that allocates airtime to the user
with the largest instantaneous channel gain achieves the optimal spectrum
efficiency and transmission reliability but the poorest user-level fairness. At
the other extreme, fixed TDMA scheduling achieves the fairest airtime
allocation but the lowest spectrum efficiency and transmission reliability. To
balance the two competing objectives, extensive research efforts have been
spent on designing opportunistic scheduling schemes that reach certain tradeoff
points between the two extremes. In this paper and in contrast to the
conventional wisdom, we find that in relay-assisted cellular networks, fixed
TDMA achieves the same optimal diversity gain as greedy opportunistic
scheduling. In addition, by incorporating very limited opportunism, a simple
relaxed-TDMA scheme asymptotically achieves the same optimal system reliability
in terms of outage probability as greedy opportunistic scheduling. This reveals
a surprising fact: transmission reliability and user fairness are no longer
contradicting each other in relay-assisted systems. They can be both achieved
by the simple TDMA schemes. For practical implementations, we further propose a
fully distributed algorithm to implement the relaxed-TDMA scheme. Our results
here may find applications in the design of next-generation wireless
communication systems with relay architectures such as LTE-advanced and WiMAX.

compute the waveforms we solve the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations in the

hole, and is globally hyperboloidal, allowing us to include future null
infinity in the computational domain by compactification. This method is called
the hyperboloidal layer method, and is discussed here for the first time in a

programming semantics, due mainly to the cut and goal and clause order. Several
alternative semantics have been put forward, exposing operational details of
the computation state. We propose instead to redesign Prolog around structured
alternatives to the cut and clauses, keeping the expressive power and
computation model but with a compositional denotational semantics over much
simpler states-just variable bindings. This considerably eases reasoning about
programs, by programmers and tools such as a partial evaluator, with safe
unfolding of calls through predicate definitions. An if-then-else across
clauses replaces most uses of the cut, but the cut's full power is achieved by
an until construct. Disjunction, conjunction and until, along with unification,
are the primitive goal types with a compositional semantics yielding sequences
of variable-binding solutions. This extends to programs via the usual technique
of a least fixpoint construction. A simple interpreter for Prolog in the
alternative language, and a definition of until in Prolog, establish the
identical expressive power of the two languages. Many useful control constructs
are derivable from the primitives, and the semantic framework illuminates the
discussion of alternative ones. The formalisation rests on a term language with
variable abstraction as in the {\lambda}-calculus. A clause is an abstraction
on the call arguments, a continuation, and the local variables. It can be
inclusive or exclusive, expressing a local case bound to a continuation by
either a disjunction or an if-then-else. Clauses are open definitions, composed
(and closed) with simple functional application ({\beta}-reduction). This paves
the way for a simple account of flexible module composition mechanisms. Cube, a
concrete language with the exposed principles, has been implemented.

similar to that of the interstellar medium. Each component of the system has a
circumstellar disc-like structure typical of young stars. The discs are highly
misaligned: the northern component is seen almost edge-on and the southern
component is an almost face-on disc. Conclusions. The two main formation
scenarios of binary systems with misaligned discs are the gravitational capture
of a passing object in a dense environment, and the fragmentation of the
collapsing molecular cloud. Given the low-density environment of the
Taurus-Aurigae star-forming region, the first scenario is unlikely for Haro
6-10. The binary system most probably formed via fragmentation of two different
parts of the collapsing molecular cloud combined with other dynamical processes
related to the cloud and/or the protostars. This can be the explanation also
for other binary systems with an infrared companion.

that this model represents a general limiting case for real systems as well as
a realistic model for certain binary fluorides and oxides. Furthermore, it is
of great relevance to the highly topical subjects of the Coulomb phase and
`charge ice'. We derive an analytical solution for the ground state phase
diagram of a model system constructed in this paradigm and identify magnetic
phases that remain either disordered or partially ordered even at zero
temperature. These phases are of a hitherto unobserved type, but may be broadly
classified as either `spin liquids' or `semi-spin liquids' in contrast to the
usual spin glass or semi-spin glass. Numerical simulations are used to show
that the spin liquid phase exhibits no spin glass transition at finite
temperature, despite the combination of frustration and disorder. By mapping
onto a model of uncoupled loops of Ising spins, we show that the magnetic
structure factor of this phase acts, in the limit $T\rightarrow0$, as a
sensitive probe of the positional disorder correlations. We suggest that this
result can be generalized to more complex systems, including experimental
realizations of canonical spin glass models.

The incoherent insulating-like behavior of rho_c at high temperature,

regime of metallic behavior at low temperature. This crossover coincides with
the emergence of the small electron pocket detected in the Fermi surface of
YBCO via quantum oscillations, the Hall and Seebeck coefficients and with the
detection of a unidirectional modulation of the charge density as seen by

consistent with the small hopping integral t_perp inferred from the splitting

assumed to relate the intrinsic fluctuations in galaxy density to matter
perturbations through a linear bias relation. Starting from simple physical
assumptions, we derive a gauge-invariant expression relating galaxy density
perturbations to matter density perturbations on large scales, and show that it
reduces to a linear bias relation in synchronous-comoving gauge, corroborating
an assumption made in several recent papers. We evaluate the resulting observed
galaxy power spectrum, and show that it leads to corrections similar to an
effective non-Gaussian bias corresponding to a local (effective) fNL < 0.5.
This number can serve as a guideline as to which surveys need to take into

by a colour temperature corrected blackbody, and this colour temperature
correction is large enough ($\sim 2.4$) that the bare disc emission from a zero
spin black hole can extend into the soft X-ray bandpass. Part of the soft X-ray
excess seen in these objects must be intrinsic emission from the disc unless
the vertical structure is very different to that predicted.
  However, the soft excess is much broader than predicted by a bare disc

soft elasticity, in which the shape of the elastomer changes at no energy cost.
The amplitude of the soft mode and the accompanying shears are dependent on the
orientation of the layer normal and the director with respect to the stretch
axis. We demonstrate that in some geometries the director is forced to rotate
perpendicular to the stretch axis, causing lateral expansion of the sample; a
negative Poisson's ratio. Current models do not include the effect of
imperfections that must be present in the physical sample. We investigate the
effect of a simple model of these imperfections on the soft modes in monodomain
smectic-C elastomers in a variety of geometries. When stretching parallel to
the layer normal (with imposed strain) the elastomer has a negative stiffness
once the director starts to rotate. We show that this is a result of the
negative Poisson's ratio in this geometry through a simple scalar model.

the sign of particular shaped triangles and tetrahedrons. Having an equilateral
density bispectrum of positive sign corresponds to having concentrated
overdensities surrounded by larger weaker underdensities. In 3D these are
concentrated density filaments, as expected in large-scale structure. As the
shape changes from equilateral to flattened the concentrated overdensities
flatten into lines (3D planes). I then focus on squeezed bispectra, which can
be thought of as correlations of changes in small-scale power with large-scale
fields, and discuss the general non-perturbative form of the squeezed
bispectrum and its angular dependence. A general trispectrum has tetrahedral
form and I show examples of what this can look like in real space. Squeezed
trispectra are of particular interest and come in two forms, corresponding to
large-scale variance of small-scale power, and correlated modulations of an
equilateral-form bispectrum. Flattened trispectra can be produced by line-like
features in 2D, for example from cosmic strings, and randomly located features
also give a non-Gaussian signal. There are relationships between the squeezed
types of non-Gaussianity, and also a useful interpretation in terms of
statistical anisotropy. I discuss the various possible physical origins of
cosmological non-Gaussianities, both in terms of primordial perturbations and
late-time dynamical and geometric effects.

are also observable deviations from this simple thermodynamic law. To
illustrate the role of the contact dynamics, we study a variant of the zero

large deviation principle. We identify an additional contribution to the large
deviation function, which we call the excess chemical potential, for the

excess chemical potential depends on the specifics of the contact dynamics and

have severe consequences for the gene pool of the expanding population. Due to
strongly enhanced genetic drift at the advancing frontier, neutral and weakly
deleterious mutations can reach large frequencies in the newly colonized
regions, as if they were surfing the front of the range expansion. These
findings raise the question of how frequently beneficial mutations successfully
surf at shifting range margins, thereby promoting adaptation towards a
range-expansion phenotype. Here, we use individual-based simulations to study
the surfing statistics of recurrent beneficial mutations on wave-like range
expansions in linear habitats. We show that the rate of surfing depends on two
strongly antagonistic factors, the probability of surfing given the spatial
location of a novel mutation and the rate of occurrence of mutations at that
location. The surfing probability strongly increases towards the tip of the
wave. Novel mutations are unlikely to surf unless they enjoy a spatial head
start compared to the bulk of the population. The needed head start is shown to
be proportional to the inverse fitness of the mutant type, and only weakly
dependent on the carrying capacity. The second factor is the mutation
occurrence which strongly decreases towards the tip of the wave. Thus, most
successful mutations arise at an intermediate position in the front of the
wave. We present an analytic theory for the tradeoff between these factors that
allows to predict how frequently substitutions by beneficial mutations occur at
invasion fronts. We find that small amounts of genetic drift increase the
fixation rate of beneficial mutations at the advancing front, and thus could be
important for adaptation during species invasions.

radio galaxy J1420-0545 is formed by a restarted rather than a primary jet
activity. This hypothesis is motivated by the unusual morphological properties
of the source, suggesting almost ballistic propagation of powerful jets in a
particularly low-density environment. New radio observations of J1420-0545
confirm its morphology consisting of only two narrow lobes; no trace of any
outer low-density cavity due to the previous jet activity is therefore
detected. Different model fits performed using the newly accessed radio data
imply relatively young age of the source, its exceptionally high expansion
velocity, large jet kinetic power, and confirm particularly low-density
environment. We find that it is possible to choose a realistic set of the model
parameters for which the hypothetical outer lobes of J1420-0545 are old enough
so that their expected radio surface brightness is substantially below the rms
noise level of the available radio maps. On the other hand, the extremely low
density of the gas surrounding the J1420-0545 lobes is consistent with the mean
density of the baryonic matter in the Universe. This suggests that the source
may be instead located in a real void of the galaxy and matter distribution. In
both cases the giant radio lobes of J1420-0545 are expected to modify
substantially the surrounding matter by driving strong shocks and heating the
gas located at the outskirts of the filamentary galactic distribution. Finally,
we also find that the energetic requirements for the source are severe in terms

single-crystalline metallic superconducting nanofilms splits the conduction
band into a series of single-electron subbands. A distinctive feature of such a
nanoscale multi-band superconductor is that the energetic position of each
subband can vary significantly with changing nanofilm thickness, substrate
material, protection cover and other details of the fabrication process. It can
occur that the bottom of one of the available subbands is situated in the
vicinity of the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the character of the
superconducting pairing in such a subband changes dramatically and exhibits a
clear molecule-like trend, which is very similar to the well-known crossover
from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime to Bose-Einstein condensation
(BCS-BEC) observed in trapped ultracold fermions. For Pb nanofilms with
thickness of 4 and 5 monolayers (ML) this will lead to a spectacular scenario:
up to half of all the Cooper pairs nearly collapse, shrinking in the lateral
size (parallel to the nanofilm) down to a few nanometers. As a result, the
superconducting condensate will be a coherent mixture of almost molecule-like
fermionic pairs with ordinary, extended Cooper pairs.

For the quasi-adiabatic solution, all of the inserted gas leaves the cluster in
the form of a stationary wind. For the bimodal solution, some of the inserted
gas becomes thermally unstable and forms dense warm clumps which accumulate
inside the cluster. We calculate the evolution of the wind velocity and energy
flux and integrate the amount of accumulated mass for clusters of different
mass, radius and initial metallicity. We consider also conditions with low
heating efficiency of the re-inserted gas or mass loading of the hot

variability on timescales of years for all sources. The flux density
distributions of five out of six sources show clear signatures of bi- or even
multimodality. Our sources show mostly steep (alpha~0.5-1), variable spectral
indices that indicate outflow dominated emission; the variability is most
probably due to optical depth variations. The power spectra globally correspond
to red-noise spectra with five sources being located between the cases of white
and flicker noise and one source (3C 111) being closer to the case of random
walk noise. For three sources the low-frequency ends of their power spectra
appear to be upscaled in spectral power by factors ~2-3 with respect to the
overall powerlaws. In two sources, 3C 454.3 and 3C 84, the 1.3-mm emission
preceeds the 3-mm emission by ~55 and ~300 days, respectively, probably due to

conclude that the source emission cannot be described by uniform stochastic

within computer science, artificial intelligence and operational research. In
order to make these methods more generally applicable, it is important to
eliminate or reduce the role of the human expert in the process of designing an
effective methodology to solve a given computational search problem.
Researchers developing such methodologies are often constrained on the number
of problem domains on which to test their adaptive, self-configuring
algorithms; which can be explained by the inherent difficulty of implementing
their corresponding domain specific software components.
  This paper presents HyFlex, a software framework for the development of
cross-domain search methodologies. The framework features a common software
interface for dealing with different combinatorial optimisation problems, and
provides the algorithm components that are problem specific. In this way, the
algorithm designer does not require a detailed knowledge the problem domains,
and thus can concentrate his/her efforts in designing adaptive general-purpose
heuristic search algorithms. Four hard combinatorial problems are fully
implemented (maximum satisfiability, one dimensional bin packing, permutation
flow shop and personnel scheduling), each containing a varied set of instance
data (including real-world industrial applications) and an extensive set of
problem specific heuristics and search operators. The framework forms the basis
for the first International Cross-domain Heuristic Search Challenge (CHeSC),
and it is currently in use by the international research community. In summary,
HyFlex represents a valuable new benchmark of heuristic search generality, with
which adaptive cross-domain algorithms are being easily developed, and reliably
compared.

relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10%

in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a

Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration

we characterize the social capital of local collaboration networks in terms of

outburst in June 2009, during which the emission of short bursts was observed.
Its properties appeared quite typical of other sources of the same class until
long-term X-ray monitoring failed to detect any period derivative. The present
upper limit on $\dot P$ implies that the surface dipole field is $B_p\lesssim
7.5\times 10^{12}\ {\rm G}$ (Rea et al 2010), well below those measured in
other Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) and in the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars

the internal field required to match the observed properties of SGR 0418+5729
ensures that crustal fractures, and hence bursting activity, can still occur at
present time. The thermal spectrum observed during the outburst decay is
compatible with the predictions of a resonant compton scattering model (as in
other SGRs/AXPs) if the field is low and the magnetospheric twist moderate.

that the vector-vector interaction in s-wave and spin 2 is very strong, to the
point of generating the 2^++ tensor mesons. On the other hand the interaction
of a pseudoscalar with a vector meson in s-wave is also very strong and it
generates dynamically the lightest axial-vector mesons. Therefore we expect the
PVV interaction to be strongly attractive and thus able to build up quasibound
PVV resonances. We calculate the three body PVV interaction by using the fixed

matroid $M_{A}(G)$ on $V(G)$. $M_{A}(G)$ may be obtained from the delta-matroid
represented by the adjacency matrix of $G$, but $M_{A}(G)$ is less sensitive to
the structure of $G$. Jaeger proved that every binary matroid is $M_{A}(G)$ for
some $G$ [Ann. Discrete Math. 17 (1983), 371-376].
  The relationship between the matroidal structure of $M_{A}(G)$ and the
graphical structure of $G$ has many interesting features. For instance, the
matroid minors $M_{A}(G)-v$ and $M_{A}(G)/v$ are both of the form
$M_{A}(G^{\prime}-v)$ where $G^{\prime}$ may be obtained from $G$ using local
complementation. In addition, matroidal considerations lead to a principal
vertex tripartition, distinct from the principal edge tripartition of
Rosenstiehl and Read [Ann. Discrete Math. 3 (1978), 195-226]. Several of these
results are given two very different proofs, the first involving linear algebra
and the second involving set systems or delta-matroids. Also, the Tutte
polynomials of the adjacency matroids of $G$ and its full subgraphs are closely
connected to the interlace polynomial of Arratia, Bollob\'{a}s and Sorkin
[Combinatorica 24 (2004), 567-584].

dragged on the surface of a granular media, both in experiment and numerical
simulation. In particular, we investigated the influence of the horizontal
velocity of the plate and its angle of attack. We show that a steady wedge of
grains is moved in front of the plow and that the lift and drag forces are
proportional to the weight of this wedge. These constants of proportionality
vary with the angle of attack but not (or only weakly) on the velocity. We
found a universal effective friction law which accounts for the dependence on
all the above-mentioned parameters. The stress and velocity fields are
calculated from the numerical simulations and show the existence of a shear
band under the wedge and that the pressure is non-hydrostatic. The strongest
gradients in stress and shear occur at the base of the plow where the

metallicity gradients of the bulge using data from the recently started ESO
public survey Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV). We derive the mean J-Ks
color of the red clump (RC) giants in 1835 subfields in the Bulge region with
-8<b<-0.4 and 0.2<l<1.7, and compare it to the color of RC stars in Baade's
Window for which we adopt E(B-V)=0.55. This allows us to derive the reddening
map on a small enough scale to minimize the problems arising from differential
extinction. The dereddened magnitudes are then used to build the bulge
luminosity function in regions of 0.4 x 0.4 deg to obtain the mean RC
magnitudes. These are used as distance indicator in order to trace the bulge
structure. Finally, for each subfield we derive photometric metallicities
through interpolation of red giant branch colors on a set of empirical ridge
lines. The photometric metallicity distributions are compared to metallicity
distributions obtained from high resolution spectroscopy in the same regions.
The reddening determination is sensitive to small scale variations which are
clearly visible in our maps. The luminosity function clearly shows the double
RC recently discovered in 2MASS and OGLE III datasets, hence allowing to trace
the X-shape morphology of the bulge. Finally, the mean of the derived
photometric metallicity distributions are in remarkable agreement with those
obtained from spectroscopy. The VVV survey presents a unique tool to map the
bulge properties by means of the consistent method presented here. The
remarkable agreement between our results and those presented in literature for
the minor axis allows us to safely extend our method to the whole region
covered by the survey.

supplemented by strong-coupling and mean-field analysis. Interestingly, this
model displays remarkable features, bridging the physics of the J_1-J_2 chain
and of the unfrustated ladder. The phase diagram as a function of the
transverse coupling J_{\perp} and the frustration J_2 exhibits an Ising
transition between a columnar phase of dimers and the usual rung-singlet phase
of two-leg ladders. The transition is driven by resonating valence bond
fluctuations in the singlet sector while the triplet spin gap remains finite
across the transition. In addition, frustration brings incommensurability in
the real-space spin correlation functions, the onset of which evolves smoothly
from the J_1-J_2 chain value to zero in the large-J_{\perp} limit. The onset of
incommensurability in the spin structure-factor and in the dispersion relation
is also analyzed. The physics of the frustrated rung-singlet phase is well
understood using perturbative expansions and mean-field theories in the

to develop the theory of pseudogroups motivated by applications to group
theory, C*-algebras and aperiodic tilings. Our starting point is an adjunction
between a category of pseudogroups and a category of etale groupoids from which
we are able to set up a duality between spatial pseudogroups and sober etale
groupoids. As a corollary to this duality, we deduce a non-commutative version
of Stone duality involving what we call boolean inverse semigroups and boolean
etale groupoids, as well as a generalization of this duality to distributive
inverse semigroups. Non-commutative Stone duality has important applications in
the theory of C*-algebras: it is the basis for the construction of Cuntz and
Cuntz-Krieger algbras and in the case of the Cuntz algebras it can also be used
to construct the Thompson groups. We then define coverages on inverse
semigroups and the resulting presentations of pseudogroups. As applications, we
show that Paterson's universal groupoid is an example of a booleanization, and
reconcile Exel's recent work on the theory of tight maps with the work of the

broad photoluiminescence (PL) spectra due to merging of four prominent peaks
viz 370, 410, 470 and 520 nm. Investigations revealed the role of interface in
contributing to the two blue peaks at 410 and 470 nm. While the 470 nm is found
to vary with ZnO grain size and their density, the 410 nm peak is attributed to
the volume of shell surrounding ZnO nanoparticles. This study shows the
contribution of ZnO cluster size and their density, as influenced by film
thickness, in the PL spectra of the samples.

Magellanic Cloud globular clusters. The primary goal of this series is to
better understand how the RR Lyrae stars in Oosterhoff-intermediate systems
compare to those in Oosterhoff I/II systems. In this paper we present the
results of our new time-series BV photometric study of NGC 1466. A total of 62
variables were identified in the cluster, of which 16 are new discoveries. The
variables include 30 RRab stars, 11 RRc's, 8 RRd's, 1 candidate RR Lyrae, 2
long-period variables, 1 potential anomalous Cepheid, and 9 variables of
undetermined classification. We present photometric parameters for these
variables.
  For the RR Lyrae stars physical properties derived from Fourier analysis of
their light curves are presented. The RR Lyrae stars were used to determine a
reddening-corrected distance modulus of (m-M)0 = 18.43 +/- 0.15. We discuss
several different indicators of Oosterhoff type and find NGC 1466 to be an
Oosterhoff-intermediate object.

  Pair-Breaking in Superconducting Vortex Lattice","26 pages, 13 figures","Phys. Rev. B 84, 184516 (2011)","10.1103/PhysRevB.84.184516",,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effects of the strong Pauli-paramagnetic pair-breaking (PPB) on the vortex
lattice in d-wave superconductors are theoretically studied by putting emphasis
on consequences of the PPB-induced antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering in the
spatial modulation in the vortex lattice. It is shown that the PPB-induced AFM
fluctuation in the superconducting state leads to an enhancement of the vortex
lattice form factor which is a measure of spatial variations of the internal
magnetic field and that the enhancement becomes more remarkable as an AFM
instability is approached. It is also demonstrated that the PPB-induced AFM
ordering is assisted by the vortex-lattice modulation, and thus, that the
resulting AFM order is spatially modulated, while it is not localized in the
vortex cores but coexistent with the nonvanishing superconducting order
parameter. These results are discussed in connection with two phenomena
observed in CeCoIn5, the anomalous field dependence of the vortex lattice form
factor and the AFM order appearing inside the high-field and low-temperature
superconducting phase.

diffractions, are used for calculating scalar light propagation. The
calculations are used in wide-ranging optics fields: for example, computer
generated holograms (CGHs), digital holography, diffractive optical elements,
microscopy, image encryption and decryption, three-dimensional analysis for
optical devices and so on. However, increasing demands made by large-scale
diffraction calculations have rendered the computational power of recent
computers insufficient. We have already developed a numerical library for
diffraction calculations using a graphic processing unit (GPU), which was named
the GWO library. However, this GWO library is not user-friendly, since it is
based on C language and was also run only on a GPU. In this paper, we develop a
new C++ class library for diffraction and CGH calculations, which is referred
as to a CWO++ library, running on a CPU and GPU. We also describe the
structure, performance, and usage examples of the CWO++ library.

  the Microworld","32 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel two-tiered organization of the microworld is presented, in which only
the fundamental quantum fields of the standard model of particle physics
(electrons, photons, quarks, etc.) are true quantum waves, exhibiting linear
superposition. In contrast, confined quantum waves and their composites (such
as nucleons and atoms) move collectively as particles following a classical
Hamiltonian trajectory, as derived from the coherent phases of the component
quantum waves. However, transitions between such quasi-classical trajectories
are still subject to quantum transition rules of energy and momentum
quantization (both linear and angular). Furthermore, there is no quantum
decoherence, and no entanglement of multi-particle states. This provides a
clear foundation for classical behavior, and avoids paradoxes of quantum
measurement such as Schr\""odinger cat states. A synthesis of this type does not
seem to have been previously examined. Can such a simple realistic
representation really account for the known physics? This does require major
reinterpretations of some established phenomena such as crystal diffraction,
phonons, and superfluids.
