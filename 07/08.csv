Due to the existence of
millisecond pulsars we know that these spins can be substantial. We argue that
spins with periods on the order a few dozen milliseconds could influence the
late inspiral and merger dynamics. Thus numerical simulations of the last few
orbits and the merger should start from initial conditions that allow for
arbitrary spins. We discuss quasi-equilibrium approximations one can make in
the construction of binary neutron star initial data with spins. Using these
approximations we are able to derive two new matter equations. As in the case
of irrotational neutron star binaries one of these equations is algebraic and
the other elliptic. If these new matter equations are solved together with the
equations for the metric variables following the Wilson-Mathews or conformal
thin sandwich approach one can construct neutron star initial data. The spin of
each star is described by a rotational velocity that can be chosen freely so
that one can create stars in arbitrary rotation states. Our new matter
equations reduce to the well known limits of both corotating and irrotational
neutron star binaries.

of the nitrogen atom (^4S) with the OH molecule, with both collision partners
initially in fully spin-stretched (magnetically trappable) states, assuming
that the interaction takes place exclusively on the two high-spin (quintet)

from spin-unrestricted coupled-cluster calculations with single, double, and
noniterative triple excitations. We find substantial inelasticity, arising from
strong couplings due to the anisotropy of the interaction potential and the
anisotropic spin-spin dipolar interaction. The mechanism involving the dipolar
interaction dominates for small magnetic field strengths and ultralow collision
energies, while the mechanism involving the potential anisotropy prevails when
the field strength is larger (above 100 G) or the collision energy is higher

we detect a gamma-ray continuum extending up to an observed energy of 145 GeV,
and furthermore we find no evidence of gamma-ray variability in the source over
its observed history. We illustrate the implications of these results in two
different domains. First, we investigate the origin of the steady gamma-ray
emission, where we re-examine the common classification of 4C +55.17 as a
quasar-hosted blazar and consider instead its possible nature as a young radio
source. We analyze and compare constraints on the source physical parameters in
both blazar and young radio source scenarios by means of a detailed
multiwavelength analysis and theoretical modeling of its broad-band spectrum.
Secondly, we show that the gamma-ray spectrum may be formally extrapolated into
the very-high energy (VHE; >= 100 GeV) range at a flux level detectable by the
current generation of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. This enables us to
place constraints on models of extragalactic background light (EBL) within LAT

particle and lighter than mass 50. The range of clusters observed in
experiments goes from $^{14}$C to $^{32}$Si while the heavy mass residue is
always a nucleus in the neighborhood of the doubly-magic $^{208}$Pb nucleus.
Cluster radioactivity is described in this paper as a very asymmetric nuclear
fission. A new fission valley leading to a decay with large fragment mass
asymmetry matching the cluster radioactivity products is found. The mass
octupole moment is found to be more convenient than the standard quadrupole
moment as the parameter driving the system to fission. The mean-field HFB
theory with the phenomenological Gogny interaction has been used to compute the
cluster emission properties of a wide range of even-even actinide nuclei from
$^{222}$Ra to $^{242}$Cm, where emission of the clusters has been
experimentally observed. Computed half-lives for cluster emission are compared
with experimental results. The noticeable agreement obtained between the
predicted properties of cluster emission (namely, clusters masses and emission
half-lives) and the measured data confirms the validity of the proposed
methodology in the analysis of the phenomenon of cluster radioactivity. A
continuous fission path through the scission point has been described using the
neck parameter constraint.

surface densities due to continuous feeding by intense cold streams leading to
violent gravitational instability, transient features and giant clumps.
Gravitational torques between the perturbations drive angular momentum out and
mass in, and the inflow provides the energy for keeping strong turbulence. We
use analytic estimates of the inflow for a self-regulated unstable disk at a
Toomre stability parameter Q~1, and isolated galaxy simulations capable of
resolving the nuclear inflow down to the central parsec. We predict an average
inflow rate ~10 Msun/yr through the disk of a 10^11 Msun galaxy, with
conditions representative of z~2 stream-fed disks. The inflow rate scales with
disk mass and (1+z)^{3/2}. It includes clump migration and inflow of the
smoother component, valid even if clumps disrupt. This inflow grows the bulge,
while only a fraction ~ 10^-3 of it needs to accrete onto a central black hole
(BH), in order to obey the observed BH-bulge relation. A galaxy of 10^11 Msun
at z~2 is expected to host a BH of ~10^8 Msun, accreting on average with
moderate sub-Eddington luminosity L_X ~ 10^42-43 erg/s, accompanied by brighter
episodes when dense clumps coalesce. We note that in rare massive galaxies at
z~6, the same process may feed 10^9 Msun BH at the Eddington rate. High central
gas column densities can severely obscure AGN in high-redshift disks, possibly
hindering their detection in deep X-ray surveys.

observed in emission. Low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy with IRTF/SpeX
indicates the presence of a low-temperature companion, which is resolved
through multi-epoch laser guide star adaptive optics imaging at Keck. The
comoving companion is separated by 338 \pm 4 mas, and its relative brightness
(\Delta K_s = 5.09 \pm 0.10) makes this system the second most extreme flux
ratio very low-mass binary identified to date. Resolved near-infrared
spectroscopy with Keck/OSIRIS identifies this companion as a T7 dwarf. The
absence of Li I absorption in combined-light optical spectroscopy constrains
the system age to >~0.8-1.0 Gyr, while the system's kinematics and unusually
low mass ratio (M_2/M_1 = 0.3-0.6) suggests that it is even older. A coevality
test of the components also indicates an older age, but reveals discrepancies
between evolutionary and atmosphere model fits of the secondary which are
likely attributable to poor reproduction of its near-infrared spectrum. With a
projected separation of 6.6 \pm 0.9 AU, the 2MASS J13153094-2649513 system is
too widely separated for mass exchange or magnetospheric interactions to be
powering its persistent nonthermal emission. Rather, the emission is probably
chromospheric in nature, signaling an inversion in the age-activity relation in
which strong magnetic fields are maintained by relatively old and massive
ultracool dwarfs.

encountered in galaxy redshift surveys, the Natural Lognormal Kriging
technique. DTFE and NNFE are based on the local geometry defined by the Voronoi

methods are analysed and compared using mock magnitude-limited and
volume-limited SDSS redshift surveys, obtained on the basis of the Millennium
simulation. We investigate error trends, biases and the topological structure
of the resulting fields, concentrating on the void population identified by the
Watershed Void Finder. Environmental effects are addressed by evaluating the
density fields on a range of Gaussian filter scales. Comparison with the void
population in the original simulation yields the fraction of false void mergers
and false void splits. In most tests DTFE, NNFE and Kriging have largely
similar density and topology error behaviour. Cosmetically, higher order NNFE
and Kriging methods produce more visually appealing reconstructions.
Quantitatively, however, DTFE performs better, even while computationally far
less demanding. A successful recovery of the void population on small scales
appears to be difficult, while the void recovery rate improves significantly on
scales > 3 h-1Mpc. A study of small scale voids and the void galaxy population
should therefore be restricted to the local Universe, out to at most 100

this duality, we consider incident gravitons coming from the dS universe
through the bubble wall into the AdS bubble in the original picture. In the
dual picture, this process has to be identified with the absorption of
gravitons by CFT matter. We have obtained a general formula for the absorption
probability in general $d+1$ spacetime dimensions. The result shows the
different behavior depending on whether spacetime dimensions are even or odd.
We find that the absorption process of gravitons from the dS universe by CFT
matter is controlled by localized gravitons (massive bound state modes in the
Kaluza-Klein decomposition) in the dS universe. The absorption probability is
determined by the effective degrees of freedom of the CFT matter and the
effective gravitational coupling constant which encodes information of
localized gravitons. We speculate that the dual of $d+1$ dimensional dS
universe with an AdS bubble is also dual to a $d$ dimensional dS universe with

about the distribution of dark matter in the Universe. In order to extract
accurate cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys, it is important to
understand how the distribution of galaxies is biased with respect to the
matter distribution. The large-scale bias of galaxies can be quantified either
by directly measuring the large-scale ({\lambda} >~ 60 hinv Mpc) power spectrum
of galaxies or by modeling the halo occupation distribution of galaxies using
their clustering on small scales ({\lambda} <~ 30 hinv Mpc). We compare the
luminosity dependence of the galaxy bias (both the shape and the normalization)
obtained by these methods and check for consistency. Our comparison reveals
that the bias of galaxies obtained by the small scale clustering measurements
is systematically larger than that obtained from the large scale power spectrum
methods. We also find systematic discrepancies in the shape of the galaxy
bias-luminosity relation. We comment on the origin and possible consequences of
these discrepancies which had remained unnoticed thus far.

CFT correlators have poles corresponding to an OPE decomposition into `left'

of scattering amplitudes. In the regime where these correlators can be computed
by tree level Witten diagrams in AdS, we derive an explicit formula for the
residues of Mellin amplitudes at the corresponding factorization poles, and we
use the conformal Casimir to show that these amplitudes obey algebraic finite

formula we obtain simple diagrammatic rules for the construction of Mellin
amplitudes corresponding to tree-level Witten diagrams in any bulk scalar
theory. We prove the diagrammatic rules using our finite difference equations.
Finally, we show that our factorization formula and our diagrammatic rules
morph into the flat space S-Matrix of the bulk theory, reproducing the usual
Feynman rules, when we take the flat space limit of AdS/CFT. Throughout we

where the transport takes place. Jamming of motors is essential for cargos to
execute long-range movement in this way. Results from computer simulations
performed using the extended model indicate that cargo may execute
bidirectional movement in the presence of motors of a single polarity,
confirming previous analytical results. Moreover, these results suggest the
existence of a balance between cargo hopping and the movement of the complex

J13142039+1320011. We detect a ~1 mJy source at 1.43, 4.86, 8.46 and 22.5 GHz,
making it the most luminous radio emission over the widest frequency range
detected from an ultracool dwarf to date. A 10 hr VLA observation reveals that
the radio emission varies sinusoidally with a period of 3.89+/-0.05 hr, and an
amplitude of ~30% at 4.86 GHz and ~20% at 8.46 GHz. The periodicity is also
seen in circular polarization, where at 4.86 GHz the polarization reverses
helicity from left- to right-handed in phase with the total intensity. An
archival detection in the FIRST survey indicates that the radio emission has
been stable for at least a decade. We also detect periodic photometric
variability in several optical filters with a period of 3.79 hr, and measure a
rotation velocity of vsini=45+/-5 km/s, in good agreement with the radio and
optical periods. The period and rotation velocity allow us to place a lower
limit on the radius of the source of >0.12 R_sun, about 30% larger than
theoretical expectations. The properties of the radio emission can be explained
with a simple model of a magnetic dipole mis-aligned relative to the stellar
rotation axis, with the sinusoidal variations and helicity reversal due to the
rotation of the magnetic poles relative to our line of sight. The long-term
stability of the radio emission indicates that the magnetic field (and hence
the dynamo) is stable on a much longer timescale than the convective turn-over
time of ~0.2 yr. If the radio emission is due to the electron cyclotron maser
process, the inferred magnetic field strength reaches at least 8 kG.

systems. This paper proposes cooperative jamming strategies for two-hop relay
networks where the eavesdropper can wiretap the relay channels in both hops. In
these approaches, the normally inactive nodes in the relay network can be used
as cooperative jamming sources to confuse the eavesdropper. Linear precoding
schemes are investigated for two scenarios where single or multiple data
streams are transmitted via a decode-and-forward (DF) relay, under the
assumption that global channel state information (CSI) is available. For the
case of single data stream transmission, we derive closed-form jamming
beamformers and the corresponding optimal power allocation. Generalized
singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based secure relaying schemes are proposed
for the transmission of multiple data streams. The optimal power allocation is
found for the GSVD relaying scheme via geometric programming. Based on this
result, a GSVD-based cooperative jamming scheme is proposed that shows
significant improvement in terms of secrecy rate compared to the approach
without jamming. Furthermore, the case involving an eavesdropper with unknown
CSI is also investigated in this paper. Simulation results show that the
secrecy rate is dramatically increased when inactive nodes in the relay network
participate in cooperative jamming.

in predicting the chemical concentration field after a chemical incident. This
model is highly nonlinear and evolves with variable state dimension and, after
sufficient time, high dimensionality. While the particle filter formalism
naturally supports variable state dimensionality high dimensionality represents
a challenge in selecting an adequate number of particles, especially for the
Bootstrap version. We present an implementation of the Bootstrap particle
filter and compare its performance with the SCIPUFF predictions. Both the model
and the Particle Filter are evaluated on the Dipole Pride 26 experimental data.
Since there is no available ground truth, the data has been divided in two
sets: training and testing. We show that even with a modest number of
particles, the Bootstrap particle filter provides better estimates of the

in computational complexity.

both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty into a second-order uncertainty
representation which is propagated through a dynamic system driven by white

uncertainty by choosing a representative approximation to the probability
density function conditioned on epistemic variables. The epistemic uncertainty
is then propagated through the moment evolution equations of the conditional

the knowledge about the system is incomplete. The output of the system is a

partial differential equations (PDE) for the evolution of the probability
density, and which will be an approximation of the discrete process in the
joint large population, small time-steps and weak selection limit. If the
fitness functions are sufficiently regular, we can recast the weak formulation
in a more standard formulation, without any boundary conditions, but
supplemented by a number of conservation laws. The equations in this family can
be purely diffusive, purely hyperbolic or of convection-diffusion type, with
frequency dependent convection. The particular outcome will depend on the
assumed scalings. The diffusive equations are of the degenerate type; using a
duality approach, we also obtain a frequency dependent version of the Kimura
equation without any further assumptions. We also show that the convective
approximation is related to the replicator dynamics and provide some estimate
of how accurate is the convective approximation, with respect to the

flux relation and power law frequency distribution. So far, the lognormal flux
distribution of black hole objects is only observational facts without
satisfactory explanation about the physical mechanism producing such
distribution in the accretion disk. One of the most promising models based on
cellular automaton mechanism has been successful in reproducing PSD (Power
Spectral Density) of the observed objects but could not reproduce lognormal
flux distribution. Such distribution requires the existence of underlying
multiplicative process while the existing SOC models are based on additive
processes. A modified SOC model based on cellular automaton mechanism for
producing lognormal flux distribution is presented in this paper. The idea is
that the energy released in the avalanche and diffusion in the accretion disk
is not entirely emitted instantaneously as in the original cellular automaton
model. Some part of the energy is kept in the disk and thus increase its energy
content so that the next avalanche will be in higher energy condition and will
release more energy. The later an avalanche occurs, the more amount of energy
is emitted to the observers. This can provide multiplicative effects to the
flux and produces lognormal flux distribution.

field aligns the electric dipole and results in chiral OAM states and the
relevant Rashba- type splitting. Therefore, the band splitting originates from
electric dipole interaction, not from the Zeeman splitting as proposed in the
original Rashba picture. The characteristic spin chiral structure of Rashba
states is formed through the spin-orbit coupling and thus is a secondary effect
to the chiral OAM. Results from first principles calculations on a single Bi

underlying the observed Classical Nova eruptions is a surface thermonuclear
runaway. We start this short review with the main observational facts that lead
to the theoretical model of a thermonuclear runaway that takes place in an
accreted hydrogen rich envelope placed on top of a cool degenerate core of a
white dwarf. According to the theory, the accreted envelope becomes unstable to
convection days to weeks prior to the runaway. During the extreme stages of the
runaway itself, when the burning is most efficient, the envelope is fully
convective. Therefore, the elements processed under such extreme conditions are
lifted to the outermost regions of the star. A significant fraction of the
envelope is ejected during the outburst. The complicated combination of
hydrodynamic instabilities and explosive hydrogen burning, close to the surface
of the star, gives us a unique opportunity to study this complex reactive flow.
The range of core masses, core temperatures and accretion rates introduce a
whole range of burning temperatures and densities. Following the description of
the ""standard"" cases, we then focus on rare, but still possible, portions of
the relevant parameter space, in which ""breakout"" of the traditional CNO cycle
can occur and lead to heavy element enrichment patterns caused only by breakout
burning. We conclude our review with the main challenges that nova theorists
face today, with special emphasis on problems related to the nucleosynthesis
issues.

recently as a key ingredient in different astrophysical scenarios, ranging from
core-colapse supernovae explosions to compact star structure. If the surface
tension is low enough, observable consequences are possible. Its value is
however not known from first-principle methods in QCD, calling for effective
approaches. Working within the framework of homogeneous nucleation by Langer,
we discuss the steps that are needed to obtain the nucleation parameters from a
given effective potential. As a model for deriving the effective potential for
the chiral transition, we adopt the linear sigma model with constituent quarks
at very low temperatures, which provides an effective description for the
thermodynamics of the strong interaction in cold and dense matter, and predict
a surface tension of Sigma ~ 5--15 MeV/fm^2, well below previous estimates.
Including temperature effects and vacuum logarithmic corrections, we find a
clear competition between these features in characterizing the dynamics of the
chiral phase conversion.

divided into the training set and the probe set randomly, without considering

aim at filling this void, we try to reevaluate the performance of local

structures in the seesaw model. Without considering any explicit flavour
symmetry, there is an instructive exercise one can do: to determine the
simplest flavour structures which can account for the data with a minimum
number of parameters, simply assuming these parameters to be uncorrelated. This
approach points towards a limited number of simple structures which show the
minimum complexity a neutrino mass model must generally involve to account for
the data. These basic structures essentially lead to only 4 relations between
the neutrino observables. We emphasize that 2 of these relations, |sin
theta_13|=(tan theta_23/cos delta)*(1-tan theta_12)/(1+tan theta_12) and |sin
theta_13| = sin theta_12 R^1/4, with R= Delta m^2_21/Delta m^2_32, have several
distinctive properties. First, they hold not only with a minimum number of
parameters, but also for complete classes of more general models. Second, any
value of theta_13 within the T2K and MINOS ranges can be obtained from these
relations by taking into account small perturbations. Third, they turn out to
be the pivot relations of models with approximate conservation of lepton
number, which allow the seesaw interactions to induce observable flavour
violating processes, such as mu -> e gamma and tau -> mu gamma. Finally, in
specific cases of this kind, these structures have the rather unique property
to allow a full reconstruction of the seesaw Lagrangian from low energy data.

of well-controlled femtosecond laser pulses. It has led to, for example, the
generation of XUV light pulses with a duration in the sub-100-attosecond
regime, to the measurement of intra-molecular dynamics by diffraction of an
electron taken from the molecule under scrutiny, and to novel ultrafast
electron holography. All these effects have been observed with atoms or
molecules in the gas phase. Although predicted to occur, a strong light-phase
sensitivity of electrons liberated by few-cycle laser pulses from solids has
hitherto been elusive. Here we show a carrier-envelope (C-E) phase-dependent
current modulation of up to 100% recorded in spectra of electrons laser-emitted
from a nanometric tungsten tip. Controlled by the C-E phase, electrons
originate from either one or two sub-500as long instances within the 6-fs laser
pulse, leading to the presence or absence of spectral interference. We also
show that coherent elastic re-scattering of liberated electrons takes place at
the metal surface. Due to field enhancement at the tip, a simple laser
oscillator suffices to reach the required peak electric field strengths,
allowing attosecond science experiments to be performed at the 100-Megahertz
repetition rate level and rendering complex amplified laser systems
dispensable. Practically, this work represents a simple, exquisitely sensitive
C-E phase sensor device, which can be shrunk in volume down to ~ 1cm3. The
results indicate that the above-mentioned novel attosecond science techniques
developed with and for atoms and molecules can also be employed with solids. In
particular, we foresee sub-femtosecond (sub-) nanometre probing of (collective)

in ${\cal L}$. Of particular interest is the appearance of a current-current
self-interaction of quark fields allowed by the Weyl weight changing the debate
about quark masses. In a second step the D(1)-Weyl symmetry is explicitly
broken and a universal mass scale is established through the mass of the
$\phi$-field appearing in the symmetry breaking Lagrangean ${\cal L}_B$. The
Weyl symmetry breaking is governed by the relation $D_\mu \Phi^2{=}0$, where
$\Phi$ is the norm of $\phi$. After D(1) symmetry breaking the masses of the
weak bosons and of the electron appear on the scene through the energy-momentum
tensor of the $\phi$-field.

variations confirms spin-glass behavior with cluster ferromagnetism of the
system. Change in the cusp position with frequency follows the Vogel-Fulcher
law, which is commonly accepted feature for a spin-glass (SG) system with
ferromagnetic clusters. The third harmonic of AC susceptibility (\c{hi}3) shows
that the system undergoes a spin glass transition below 80 K. Superconducting

with those recently derived in Galactic AGB carbon stars show a correlation
with the observed carbon and s-element enhancements. The observed correlations
however, display a different dependence on the stellar metallicity with respect
to theoretical predictions in low mass, low metallicity AGB models. We briefly
discuss the possible reasons for this discrepancy. If our findings are
confirmed in a larger number of metal-poor AGBs, the issue of F production in
AGB stars will need to be revisited.

  Resource Constrained Devices",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an attractive alternative to
conventional public key cryptography, such as RSA. ECC is an ideal candidate
for implementation on constrained devices where the major computational
resources i.e. speed, memory are limited and low-power wireless communication
protocols are employed. That is because it attains the same security levels
with traditional cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. Moreover, in
several application areas such as person identification and eVoting, it is
frequently required of entities to prove knowledge of some fact without
revealing this knowledge. Such proofs of knowledge are called Zero Knowledge
Interactive Proofs (ZKIP) and involve interactions between two communicating
parties, the Prover and the Verifier. In a ZKIP, the Prover demonstrates the
possesion of some information (e.g. authentication information) to the Verifier
without disclosing it. In this paper, we focus on the application of ZKIP
protocols on resource constrained devices. We study well-established ZKIP
protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem and we transform them under
the ECC setting. Then, we implement the proposed protocols on Wiselib, a
generic and open source algorithmic library. Finally, we present a thorough
evaluation of the protocols on two popular hardware platforms equipped with low
end microcontrollers (Jennic JN5139, TI MSP430) and 802.15.4 RF transceivers,
in terms of code size, execution time, message size and energy requirements. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of implementing and
evaluating ZKIP protocols with emphasis on low-end devices. This work's results
can be used from developers who wish to achieve certain levels of security and
privacy in their applications.

systems due to their computationally efficient encoding and decoding
procedures. An MDS code with r redundancy nodes can correct any r erasures by
accessing (reading) all the remaining information in both the systematic nodes
and the parity (redundancy) nodes. However, in practice, a single erasure is
the most likely failure event; hence, a natural question is how much
information do we need to access in order to rebuild a single storage node? We
define the rebuilding ratio as the fraction of remaining information accessed
during the rebuilding of a single erasure. In our previous work we showed that
the optimal rebuilding ratio of 1/r is achievable (using our newly constructed
array codes) for the rebuilding of any systematic node, however, all the
information needs to be accessed for the rebuilding of the parity nodes.
Namely, constructing array codes with a rebuilding ratio of 1/r was left as an
open problem. In this paper, we solve this open problem and present array codes
that achieve the lower bound of 1/r for rebuilding any single systematic or

from a time-reversible Markov chain arising from an ideal CSMA network model

throughputs. However, an idealized and important assumption made in ICN is that
the backoff countdown process is in ""contiuous-time"" and carrier sensing is
instantaneous. As a result, there is no collision in ICN. In practical CSMA
protocols such as IEEE 802.11, the stations count down in ""mini-timeslot"" and
the process is therefore a ""discrete-time"" process. In particular, two stations
may end their backoff process in the same mini-timeslot and then transmit
simultaneously, resulting in a packet collision. This paper is an attempt to
study how to compute link throughputs after taking such backoff collision
effects into account. We propose a generalized ideal CSMA network model (GICN)
to characterize the collision states as well as the interactions and dependency
among links in the network. We show that link throughputs and collision
probability can be computed from GICN. Simulation results validate GICN's

how to 'switch off' the magnetic interaction of a magnetic material with
existing magnetic fields without modifying them. Here we introduce the
antimagnet, a design to conceal the magnetic response of a given volume from
its exterior, without altering the external magnetic fields, somehow analogous
to the recent theoretical proposals for cloaking electromagnetic waves with
metamaterials. However, different from these devices requiring extreme material
properties, our device is feasible and needs only two kinds of available
materials: superconductors and isotropic magnetic materials. Antimagnets may
have applications in magnetic-based medical techniques such as MRI or in
reducing the magnetic signature of vessels or planes.

reach thermal equilibrium may largely exceed the typical experimental time,
which is about 15h in standard protocols (Hooyberghs et al. Phys. Rev. E 81,
012901 (2010)). In this paper we discuss how this breakdown of thermodynamic
equilibrium could be detected in microarray experiments without resorting to
real time hybridization data, which are difficult to implement in standard
experimental conditions. The method is based on the analysis of the
distribution of fluorescence intensities I from different spots for probes
carrying base mismatches. In thermal equilibrium and at sufficiently low
concentrations, log I is expected to be linearly related to the hybridization
free energy $\Delta G$ with a slope equal to $1/RT_{exp}$, where $T_{exp}$ is
the experimental temperature and R is the gas constant. The breakdown of
equilibrium results in the deviation from this law. A model for hybridization
kinetics explaining the observed experimental behavior is discussed, the
so-called 3-state model. It predicts that deviations from equilibrium yield a
proportionality of $\log I$ to $\Delta G/RT_{eff}$. Here, $T_{eff}$ is an
effective temperature, higher than the experimental one. This behavior is
indeed observed in some experiments on Agilent arrays. We analyze experimental
data from two other microarray platforms and discuss, on the basis of the
results, the attainment of equilibrium in these cases. Interestingly, the same
3-state model predicts a (dynamical) saturation of the signal at values below
the expected one at equilibrium.

equilateral non-Gaussianities, respectively), misestimations of fNL if one
chooses the wrong non-Gaussianity model (misestimations by up to a factor of
+/-3 in fNL are possible, depending on the choice of the model), the
probability of noticing such a mistake (improbably large values for the
chi^2-functional occur from fNL 200 on), degeneracies of the primordial
bispectrum with other cosmological parameters (only the matter density Omega_m
plays a significant role), and the subtraction of the much larger,
structure-formation generated bispectrum. If a prior on a standard
wCDM-parameter set is available from Euclid and Planck, the structure formation
bispectrum can be predicted accurately enough for subtraction, and any residual
structure formation bispectrum would influence the estimation of fNL to a minor
degree. Configuration-space integrations which appear in the evaluation of
chi^2-functionals and related quantities can be carried out very efficiently
with Monte-Carlo techniques, which reduce the complexity by a factor of O(10^4)
while delivering sub-percent accuracies. Weak lensing probes smaller scales
than the CMB and hence provide an additional constraint on non-Gaussianities,
even though they are not as sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianities as the
CMB.

click models. Recent empirical analysis on search engine logs suggests a
unified click models for both ranked ads and search results. The segregated
view of document and ad rankings does not consider this commonality. Further,
the used models consider parameters of (i) probability of the user abandoning
browsing results (ii) perceived relevance of result snippets. But how to
consider them for improved ranking is unknown currently. In this paper, we
propose a generalized ranking function---namely ""Click Efficiency (CE)""---for
documents and ads based on empirically proven user click models. The ranking
considers parameters (i) and (ii) above, optimal and has the same time
complexity as sorting. To exploit its generality, we examine the reduced forms
of CE ranking under different assumptions enumerating a hierarchy of ranking
functions. Some of the rankings in the hierarchy are currently used ad and
document ranking functions; while others suggest new rankings. While optimality
of ranking is sufficient for document ranking, applying CE ranking to ad
auctions requires an appropriate pricing mechanism. We incorporate a second
price based pricing mechanism with the proposed ranking. Our analysis proves
several desirable properties including revenue dominance over VCG for the same
bid vector and existence of a Nash Equilibrium in pure strategies. The
equilibrium is socially optimal, and revenue equivalent to the truthful VCG
equilibrium. Further, we relax the independence assumption in CE ranking and
analyze the diversity ranking problem. We show that optimal diversity ranking
is NP-Hard in general, and that a constant time approximation is unlikely.
