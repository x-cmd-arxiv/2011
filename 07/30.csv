  Theorem 3.15 in sec. 3.6. 2) Some minor updates in sec. 4. 3) Some proofs

values, that satisfy a number of linear constraints. If $m$ is fixed while $n$
increases, most sequences that satisfy the constraints result in frequency
vectors whose entropy approaches that of the maximum entropy vector satisfying
the constraints. This well-known ""entropy concentration"" phenomenon underlies
the maximum entropy method.
  Existing proofs of the concentration phenomenon are based on limits or
asymptotics and unrealistically assume that constraints hold precisely,
supporting maximum entropy inference more in principle than in practice. We
present, for the first time, non-asymptotic, explicit lower bounds on $n$ for a
number of variants of the concentration result to hold to any prescribed
accuracies, with the constraints holding up to any specified tolerance, taking
into account the fact that allocations of discrete units can satisfy
constraints only approximately. Again unlike earlier results, we measure
concentration not by deviation from the maximum entropy value, but by the
$\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ distances from the maximum entropy-achieving frequency
vector. One of our results holds independently of the alphabet size $m$ and is
based on a novel proof technique using the multi-dimensional Berry-Esseen
theorem. We illustrate and compare our results using various detailed examples.

We compute the radial velocity (RV) signal due to this fluid motion in the
equilibrium tide approximation. The predicted radial velocities in the observed
sample of exoplanets exceed 1 m/s for 17 systems, with the largest predicted
signal being ~30 m/s for WASP-18 b. Tidally-induced RV's are thus detectable
with present methods. Both tidal fluid flow and the epicyclic motion of a
slightly eccentric orbit produce an RV signal at twice the orbital frequency.
If care is not taken, the tidally induced RV may, in some cases, be confused
with a finite orbital eccentricity. Indeed, WASP-18 b is reported to have an
eccentric orbit with small e=0.009 and pericenter longitude \omega=-\pi/2.
Whereas such a close alignment of the orbit and line of sight to the observer
requires fine tuning, this phase in the RV signal is naturally explained by the
tidal velocity signature of an e=0 orbit. Additionally, the equilibrium tide
estimate for the amplitude is in rough agreement with the data. Thus the
reported eccentricity for WASP-18 b is instead likely a signature of the
tidally-induced RV in the stellar host. Measurement of both the orbital and
tidal velocity for non-transiting planets may allow planet mass and inclination
to be separately determined solely from radial velocity data. We suggest that
high precision fitting of RV data should include the tidal velocity signal in
those cases where it may affect the determination of orbital parameters.

of hydrogen with principal quantum number n=2 being subjected to adiabatically
varying external electric and magnetic fields. Convenient representations of
the flux densities as complex integrals are derived. Both, parity conserving
(PC) and parity violating (PV) flux densities and phases are identified.
General expressions for the flux densities following from rotational invariance
are derived. Specific cases of external fields are discussed. In a pure
magnetic field the phases are given by the geometry of the path in magnetic
field space. But for electric fields in presence of a constant magnetic field
and for electric plus magnetic fields the geometric phases carry information on
the atomic parameters, in particular, on the PV atomic interaction. We show
that for our metastable states also the decay rates can be influenced by the
geometric phases and we give a concrete example for this effect. Finally we
emphasise that the general relations derived here for geometric phases and flux
densities are also valid for other atomic systems having stable or metastable
states, for instance, for He with n=2. Thus, a measurement of geometric phases
may give important experimental information on the mass matrix and the electric
and magnetic dipole matrices for such systems. This could be used as a check of
corresponding theoretical calculations of wave functions and matrix elements.

similar percolation phenomenon also occurs in zero external field. Using exact
algorithms, we study ground states of large samples and find little evidence

random field strengths, there is an extended region of the phase diagram, where
finite samples are indistinguishable from a critical percolating system. In
this regime we examine ground-state domain walls, finding strong evidence that
they are conformally invariant and satisfy Schramm-Loewner evolution

magnitude of the structural relations from early-type galaxies is a useful tool
to study the universality of these structural relations, that is to say, to
study whether the structural relations depend on luminosity, wavelength,
redshift and/or environment. In this work we study the intrinsic dispersion of
the Faber-Jackson relation as function of the luminosity, mass and redshift.
  Methods. We use a sample of approximately 90 000 early-type galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR7) spanning a magnitude range of 7 $mag$ in
both $g$ and $r$ filters. We calculate the intrinsic dispersion of the
Faber-Jackson relation at approximately constant magnitude and compare this at
different luminosities, masses and redshifts.
  Results. The main results are the following: i) The intrinsic dispersion of
the Faber-Jackson relation depends on the luminosity, mass and redshift. ii)
The distribution for brighter and more massive galaxies has smaller intrinsic
dispersion than that for fainter and less massive galaxies. iii) The
distribution of bright and massive galaxies at higher redshift has smaller
intrinsic dispersion than those similar galaxies at low redshift.
  Conclusions. Comparisons of the results found in this work with recent
studies from the literature make us conclude that the intrinsic dispersion of
the Faber-Jackson relation could depend on the history of galaxies, in other
words, the intrinsic dispersion could depend on the number and nature of
transformation events that have affected the galaxies along their life times,
such as collapse, accretion, interaction and merging.

Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) requires detailed spectroscopic modeling that straddles
the $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak in the 100 keV - 1 MeV range. Historically, empirical
fits such as the popular Band function have been employed with considerable
success in interpreting the observations. While extrapolations of the Band
parameters can provide some physical insight into the emission mechanisms
responsible for GRBs, these inferences do not provide a unique way of
discerning between models. By fitting physical models directly this degeneracy
can be broken, eliminating the need for empirical functions; our analysis here
offers a first step in this direction. One of the oldest, and leading,
theoretical ideas for the production of the prompt signal is the synchrotron
shock model (SSM). Here we explore the applicability of this model to a bright
{\it Fermi} GBM burst with a simple temporal structure, GRB {\it 090820}A. Our
investigation implements, for the first time, thermal and non-thermal
synchrotron emissivities in the RMFIT forward-folding spectral analysis
software often used in GBM burst studies. We find that these synchrotron
emissivities, together with a blackbody shape, provide at least as good a match
with the data as the Band GRB spectral fitting function. This success is
achieved in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectral fits.

Recent experimental results showed a close relation between this speed and the
local ratio of shear to normal stress measured before slip occurs (static
stress ratio). Using a two-dimensional finite element model, we demonstrate,
however, that fronts propagating in different directions do not have the same
dynamics under similar stress conditions. A lack of correlation is also
observed between accelerating and decelerating slip fronts. These effects
cannot be entirely associated with static local stresses but call for a dynamic
description. Considering a dynamic stress ratio (measured in front of the slip
tip) instead of a static one reduces the above-mentioned inconsistencies.
However, the effects of the direction and acceleration are still present. To
overcome this we propose an energetic criterion that uniquely associates,
independently on the direction of propagation and its acceleration, the slip
front velocity with the relative rise of the energy density at the slip tip.

the distribution under each hypothesis, but not the prior probabilities. This
paper is aimed at providing theory to quantify the performance of detection via
estimating prior probabilities from either labeled or unlabeled training data.
The error or {\em risk} is considered as a function of the prior probabilities.
We show that the risk function is locally Lipschitz in the vicinity of the true
prior probabilities, and the error of detectors based on estimated prior
probabilities depends on the behavior of the risk function in this locality. In
general, we show that the error of detectors based on the Maximum Likelihood
Estimate (MLE) of the prior probabilities converges to the Bayes error at a
rate of $n^{-1/2}$, where $n$ is the number of training data. If the behavior
of the risk function is more favorable, then detectors based on the MLE have
errors converging to the corresponding Bayes errors at optimal rates of the
form $n^{-(1+\alpha)/2}$, where $\alpha>0$ is a parameter governing the
behavior of the risk function with a typical value $\alpha = 1$. The limit
$\alpha \rightarrow \infty$ corresponds to a situation where the risk function
is flat near the true probabilities, and thus insensitive to small errors in
the MLE; in this case the error of the detector based on the MLE converges to
the Bayes error exponentially fast with $n$. We show the bounds are achievable
no matter given labeled or unlabeled training data and are minimax-optimal in
labeled case.

parameters in understanding the ISM, but there is still uncertainty surrounding
these parameters. In this paper, the dust-to-metals ratio in the Galaxy is
determined using the photoelectric absorption of the X-ray afterglows of a
sample of several hundred gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to determine the metal column
density in combination with Galactic dust maps to determine the line-of-sight
dust extinction through the Galaxy in the direction of the GRB. GRB afterglows
often have large extragalactic soft X-ray absorptions and therefore the GRB
sample's upper-bound will define the Galactic dust-to-metals relation. Using a
two-dimensional two-sample KS test, we determine this upper-bound and so derive
the dust-to-metals ratio of the Galaxy. We find N_H = 2.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4}e21
cm^-2 A_V assuming solar, Anders & Grevesse (1989), metallicity. This result is
consistent with previous findings using bright X-ray sources in the Galaxy.
Using the same technique but substituting the HI maps from the
Leiden-Argentine-Bonn survey for the dust maps, allows us to place a limit on
the metallicity in the Galaxy. We find a metallicity consistent with the Anders
& Grevesse (1989) solar values often used in X-ray fitting. Based on this and
previous studies, we suggest that the metallicity of a typical ISM sightline
through the Galaxy is ~0.25 dex higher than the current best estimate of the
solar metallicity. We further show that the dust-to-gas ratio seems to be
correlated with the total gas column density, and that this may be due to the
metallicity gradient observed toward the Galactic centre. Based on the
non-constant nature of the dust-to-gas ratio, we propose that the dust column
density, at N_H = 2.2e21 cm^-2 A_V, represents a better proxy for the soft
X-ray absorption column density than HI maps.

is proposed and argued. First the supergravity background of unwrapped and flat
D7-branes with running axion and dilaton on R^{1,7} x C^1/Z_2 is studied
together with the corresponding N=1 SU(N) gauge theory in eight dimensions. The
D7-branes are then wrapped over a 4-cycle on T^2/Z_2 x T^2/Z_2 which turns on
all F_1, F_3, H_3, and F_5 fluxes of type IIB theory and induces torsion. The
supergravity solutions are explicitly constructed with exact analytic
expressions for all components of the metric and the fluxes. The background
geometry of the four-dimensional gauge theory is compact and conformally
Calabi-Yau. The internal space normal to the wrapped D7-branes at the infrared
boundary is S^1 whose radius is set by the nonperturbative scale of the gauge
theory and spacetime is R^{1,3} at the ultraviolet boundary. The gauge coupling
of the four-dimensional gauge theory is related to the gauge coupling of the
eight-dimensional gauge theory and the volume of the 4-cycle. The gravity
theory reproduces the renormalization group flow and the pattern of chiral
symmetry breaking of the gauge theory and leads to confinement. The curvature
is small and nearly constant and the supergravity flow is smooth in the
infrared region where the gauge theory is strongly coupled and a dual gravity
description is useful. String loop corrections are small for large N. The scale
of string tension in four dimensions is of the same order as the scale of
Kaluza-Klein masses.

to explore the T-P phase diagram and to compare the combined effects of
iso-electronic Ru substitution and pressure. The parent compound BaFe2As2
exhibits a structural/magnetic phase transition near 134 K. At ambient
pressure, progressively increasing Ru concentration suppresses this phase
transition to lower temperatures at the approximate rate of ~5 K/% Ru and is
correlated with the emergence of superconductivity. By applying pressure to
this system, a similar behavior is seen for each concentration: the
structural/magnetic phase transition is further suppressed and
superconductivity induced and ultimately, for larger x Ru and P, suppressed. A
detailed comparison of the T-P phase diagrams for all Ru concentrations shows
that 3 GPa of pressure is roughly equivalent to 10% Ru substitution.

the melting of the liquid media, 4 : 6 light mineral oil : n-pentane and 1 : 1

thicknesses of a few tens of electron skin depths, and persisting on
time-scales much longer than the electron time scale. This DC magnetic field is
not captured by MHD models since it arises from intrinsically kinetic effects.

the LME in a locally Sobolev space follows as a direct application of the

measure of the density of the point set. The analysis also shows how to
parameterize the LME scheme for optimal convergence. Because of the convex
approximation property of LME, its behavior near the boundary is singular and
requires additional analysis. For the particular case of polyhedral domains we
show that, away from a small singular part of the boundary, any Sobolev

The obtained results are different from the previous ones in the literature,
which mainly assume algebraic or trigonometric polynomial dependence on the
state variables. As a model, we consider the pendulum equation with several
meromorphic perturbations and we show the sensitivity of the size of the
splitting on the width of the analyticity strip of the perturbation with
respect to the state variables. We show that the size of the splitting is
exponentially small if the strip of analyticity is wide enough. Furthermore, we
see that the splitting grows as the width of the analyticity strip shrinks,
even becoming non-exponentially small for very narrow strips. Our results
prevent from using polynomial truncations of the meromorphic perturbation to
compute the size of the splitting of separatrices.

64^{+10}_{-14}% (old) of the total star formation in the last 50 Myrs. Adopting
these fractions as probabilities suggests that the most probable M_{ZAMS} is
13^{+2}_{-1} M_{Sun}. These results are most sensitive to the luminosity
function along the well-understood main sequence and are less sensitive to
uncertain late-stage stellar evolution. Therefore, they stand even if the
progenitor suffered disruptive post-main-sequence evolution (e.g. eruptive mass
loss or binary Roche-lobe overflow). Progenitor identification will help to
further constrain the appropriate population. Even though pre-explosion images
show a yellow supergiant (YSG) at the site of the SN, panchromatic SN light
curves suggest a more compact star as the progenitor. In spite of this, our
results suggest an association between the YSG and the SN. Not only was the
star located at the SN site, but reinforcing an association, the star's
bolometric luminosity is consistent with the final evolutionary stage of the 17
Myr old star burst. If the YSG disappears, then M_{ZAMS}=13^{+2}_{-1} M_{Sun},

the exchange of virtual sterile neutrinos, that mix with the ordinary neutrinos
and are heavier than 200 MeV. Interestingly, this hypothesis is subject only to
marginal experimental constraints, because of the new nuclear matrix elements.
This possibility is analyzed in the context of the Type I seesaw model,
performing also exploratory investigations of the implications for heavy
neutrino mass spectra, rare decays of mesons as well as neutrino-decay search,
LHC, and lepton flavor violation. The heavy sterile neutrinos can saturate the
rate only when their masses are below some 10 TeV, but in this case, the
suppression of the light-neutrino masses has to be more than the ratio of the
electroweak scale and the heavy-neutrino scale; i.e., more suppressed than the
naive seesaw expectation. We classify the cases when this condition holds true
in the minimal version of the seesaw model, showing its compatibility (1) with
neutrinoless double beta rate being dominated by heavy neutrinos and (2) with
any light neutrino mass spectra. The absence of excessive fine-tunings and the
radiative stability of light neutrino mass matrices, together with a saturating
sterile neutrino contribution, imply an upper bound on the heavy neutrino
masses of about 10 GeV. We extend our analysis to the Extended seesaw scenario,
where the light and the heavy sterile neutrino contributions are completely
decoupled, allowing the sterile neutrinos to saturate the present experimental
bound on neutrinoless double beta decay. In the models analyzed, the rate of
this process is not strictly connected with the values of the light neutrino
masses, and a fast transition rate is compatible with neutrinos lighter than
100 meV.

of molecular cloud cores to form protostars. The calculations follow the
formation and evolution of the first hydrostatic core/disc, the collapse to
form a stellar core, and effect of stellar core formation on the surrounding
disc and envelope. Past barotropic calculations have shown that
rapidly-rotating first cores evolve into `pre-stellar discs' with radii up to
~100 AU that may last thousands of years before a stellar core forms. We
investigate how the inclusion of a realistic equation of state and radiative
transfer alters this behaviour, finding that the qualitative behaviour is
similar, but that the pre-stellar discs may last 1.5-3 times longer in the more
realistic calculations. The masses, radii, and lifetimes of the discs increase
for initial molecular cloud cores with faster rotation rates. In the most
extreme case we model, a pre-stellar disc with a mass of 0.22 Msun and a radius
of ~100 AU can form in a solar-mass cloud and last several thousand years
before a stellar core is formed. Such large, massive objects may be imaged
using ALMA. Fragmentation of these massive discs may also provide an effective
route to binary and multiple star formation, before radiative feedback from
accretion onto the stellar core can inhibit fragmentation. Once collapse to
form a stellar core occurs within the pre-stellar disc, the radiation
hydrodynamical simulations produce qualitatively different behaviour from the
barotropic calculations due to the accretion energy released. This drives a
shock wave through the circumstellar disc and launches a bipolar outflow even
in the absence of magnetic fields.

$\phi^{\mu}_{c}$, gradually decrease from the random close packing point for
zero friction, to a value coincident with random loose packing as the friction
coefficient is increased over several orders of magnitude. This is accompanied

$z^{\mu}_{c}$, which varies from approximately six to four with increasing
friction. Universal power law scaling is observed in the pressure and
coordination number as a function of distance from the generalised,
friction-dependent jamming point. Various power laws are also reported between

planet (exoplanet) detection, planetary orbit estimation, and adaptive
scheduling of observations. Our work addresses analysis of stellar reflex
motion data, where a planet is detected by observing the ""wobble"" of its host
star as it responds to the gravitational tug of the orbiting planet. Newtonian
mechanics specifies an analytical model for the resulting time series, but it
is strongly nonlinear, yielding complex, multimodal likelihood functions; it is
even more complex when multiple planets are present. The parameter spaces range
in size from few-dimensional to dozens of dimensions, depending on the number
of planets in the system, and the type of motion measured (line-of-sight
velocity, or position on the sky). Since orbits are periodic, Bayesian
generalizations of periodogram methods facilitate the analysis. This relies on
the model being linearly separable, enabling partial analytical
marginalization, reducing the dimension of the parameter space. Subsequent
analysis uses adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and adaptive importance
sampling to perform the integrals required for both inference (planet detection
and orbit measurement), and information-maximizing sequential design (for
adaptive scheduling of observations). We present an overview of our current
techniques and highlight directions being explored by ongoing research.

multiple access channel with generalized feedback (MAC-GF). Two users
communicate with one destination over a discrete memoryless channel using time
division. Each transmission block is divided into 3 time slots with variable
durations: the destination is always in receive mode, while each user
alternatively transmits and receives during the first 2 time slots, then both
cooperate to send information during the last one. The paper proposes two
decode-forward based coding schemes, analyzes their rate regions, and also
derives two outer bounds with rate constraints similar to the achievable
regions. Both schemes requires no block Makovity, allowing the destination to
decode at the end of each block without any delay. In the first scheme, the
codewords in the third time slot are superimposed on the codewords of the first
two, whereas in the second scheme, these codewords are independent. While the
second scheme is simpler, the first scheme helps emphasize the importance of
joint decoding over separate decoding among multiple time slots at the
destination. For the Gaussian channel, the two schemes with joint decoding are
equivalent, as are the two outer bounds. For physically degraded Gaussian
channels, the proposed schemes achieve the capacity. Extension to the m-user
half-duplex MAC-GF are provided. Numerical results for the Gaussian channel
shows significant rate region improvement over the classical MAC and that the
outer bound becomes increasingly tight as the inter-user link quality increases

of network resources among a set of agents, an all-important issue for the
efficiency of transportation networks all around us. We analyse a generic
mechanism that distributes network capacity fairly among existing flow demands.
The problem can be solved by semi-analytical methods on a nearest neighbour
graph with one source and sink pair, when transport occurs over shortest paths.
For this setup, we uncover a broad range of patterns of intersecting shortest
paths as a function of the distance between the source and the sink. When the
number of intersections is the maximum and the distance between the source and
the sink is large, we find that a fair allocation implies a decrease of at
least 50% from the maximum throughput. We also find that the histogram of the
flow allocations assigned to the agents decays as a power-law with exponent -1.
Our semi-analytical framework suggests possible explanations for the well-known
reduction of the throughput in fair allocations. It also suggests that the
combination of network topology and routing rules can lead to highly uneven
(but fair) distributions of resources, a remark of caution to network
designers.

a regularity result due to Kalita to the stochastic case. Concerning the

understanding the structure and formation of social networks, and can help
guide the design of efficient graph algorithms. In particular, the Power-law
degree distribution has long been used to model the structure of online social
networks, and is the basis for algorithms and heuristics in graph applications
such as influence maximization and social search. Along with recent measurement
results, our interest in this topic was sparked by our own experimental results
on social graphs that deviated significantly from those predicted by a
Power-law model. In this work, we seek a deeper understanding of these
deviations, and propose an alternative model with significant implications on
graph algorithms and applications. We start by quantifying this artifact using
a variety of real social graphs, and show that their structures cannot be
accurately modeled using elementary distributions including the Power-law.
Instead, we propose the Pareto-Lognormal (PLN) model, verify its
goodness-of-fit using graphical and statistical methods, and present an
analytical study of its asymptotical differences with the Power-law. To
demonstrate the quantitative benefits of the PLN model, we compare the results
of three wide-ranging graph applications on real social graphs against those on
synthetic graphs generated using the PLN and Power-law models. We show that
synthetic graphs generated using PLN are much better predictors of degree
distributions in real graphs, and produce experimental results with errors that
are orders-of-magnitude smaller than those produced by the Power-law model.

force calculations in an N-particle system. The tree is built in a ""top-down""
fashion by ""recursive coordinate bisection"" where on each tree level we split
the longest side of a cell through its centre of mass. This procedure continues
until the average number of particles in the lowest tree level has dropped
below a prescribed value. To calculate the forces on the particles in each
lowest-level cell we split the gravitational interaction into a near- and a
far-field. Since our main intended applications are SPH simulations, we
calculate the near-field by a direct, kernel-smoothed summation, while the far
field is evaluated via a Cartesian Taylor expansion up to quadrupole order.
Instead of applying the far-field approach for each particle separately, we use
another Taylor expansion around the centre of mass of each lowest-level cell to
determine the forces at the particle positions. Due to this ""cell-cell
interaction"" the code performance is close to O(N) where N is the number of
used particles. We describe in detail various technicalities that ensure a low
memory footprint and an efficient cache use.
  In a set of benchmark tests we scrutinize our new tree and compare it to the
""Press tree"" that we have previously made ample use of. At a slightly higher
force accuracy than the Press tree, our tree turns out to be substantially
faster and increasingly more so for larger particle numbers. For four million
particles our tree build is faster by a factor of 25 and the time for neighbour
search and gravity is reduced by more than a factor of 6. In single processor
tests with up to 10^8 particles we confirm experimentally that the scaling
behaviour is close to O(N). The current Fortran 90 code version is
OpenMP-parallel and scales excellently with the processor number (=24) of our
test machine.

disk. In most models thick disks are thought to be a necessary consequence of
the disk formation and/or evolution of the galaxy. We present the results of a
study of the thick disk properties in a sample of carefully selected edge-on
galaxies with types ranging from T=3 to T=8. We fitted one-dimensional
luminosity profiles with physically motivated functions - the solutions of two
stellar and one gaseous isothermal coupled disks in equilibrium - which are
likely to yield more accurate results than other functions used in previous
studies. The images used for the fits come from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar
Structure in Galaxies (S4G). We found that thick disks are on average more
massive than previously reported, mostly due to the selected fitting function.
Typically, the thin and the thick disk have similar masses. We also found that
thick disks do not flare significantly within the observed range in
galactocentric radii and that the ratio of thick to thin disk scaleheights is
higher for galaxies of earlier types.
  Our results tend to favor an in situ origin for most of the stars in the
thick disk. In addition the thick disk may contain a significant amount of
stars coming from satellites accreted after the initial build-up of the galaxy
and an extra fraction of stars coming from the secular heating of the thin disk
by its own overdensities.
  Assigning thick disk light to the thin disk component may lead to an
underestimate of the overall stellar mass in galaxies, because of different
mass to light ratios in the two disk components. On the basis of our new
results, we estimate that disk stellar masses are between 10% and 50% higher
than previously thought and we suggest that thick disks are a reservoir of
""local missing baryons"".

because they ignored the disturbance of measurement by identical particles and
standard quantum mechanics had to be modified to obey the cluster separability
principle. The key tool was the notion of separation status. Changes of
separation status occur during preparations, registrations and scattering on
macroscopic targets. Standard quantum mechanics does not provide any correct
rules that would govern these changes. This gives us the possibility to add new
rules to quantum mechanics that would satisfy the objectification requirement.
The method of the present paper is to start from the standard unitary evolution
and then introduce minimal corrections. Several representative examples of

two, we focus on the analysis of the recoil occurring in the merger of binary
black holes, extending the analysis initiated in [1] with Robinson- Trautman
spacetimes. More specifically, we probe spacetime dynamics through the
correlation of quantities defined at the black-hole horizon and at null
infinity. The geometry of these hypersurfaces responds to bulk gravitational
fields acting as test screens in a scattering perspective of spacetime
dynamics. Within a 3 + 1 approach we build an effective-curvature vector from
the intrinsic geometry of dynamical-horizon sections and correlate its
evolution with the flux of Bondi linear momentum at large distances. We employ
this setup to study numerically the head-on collision of nonspinning black
holes and demonstrate its validity to track the qualita- tive aspects of recoil
dynamics at infinity. We also make contact with the suggestion that the
antikick can be described in terms of a ""slowness parameter"" and how this can
be computed from the local properties of the horizon. In a companion paper [2]

foliation uniqueness, leads to a preferred class of null tetrads and Weyl
scalars on these hypersurfaces. Second, we identify a heuristic horizon
news-like function, depending only on the geometry of spatial sections of the

quantities to be correlated with Bondi fluxes at infinity, as well as a contact
with the discussion of quasi-local 4-momentum on dynamical horizons. Third, we
highlight the importance of tracking the internal horizon dual to the apparent
horizon in spatial 3-slices when integrating fluxes along the horizon. Finally,
we discuss the link between the dissipation of the non-stationary part of the

FFE shows monotonicity and continuity with respect to $\gamma$. For every

$\gamma$ for which the minimum of the $\gamma$-parameterized FFE functional is
equal to the permanent of the matrix, where the lower and upper bounds of the
$\gamma$-interval corresponds to respective bounds for the permanent. Our
experimental analysis suggests that the distribution of $\gamma_*$ varies for
different ensembles but $\gamma_*$ always lies within the $[-1;-1/2]$ interval.
Moreover, for all ensembles considered the behavior of $\gamma_*$ is highly
distinctive, offering an emprirical practical guidance for estimating

sizes of UV lines $R^{\rm{uv}}_{\rm{BLR}}$. It is applied to 3C 273. First, we
derive the time lags of radio emission relative to broad emission lines
Ly$\alpha$ and C IV by the ZDCF method. The broad lines lag the 5, 8, 15, 22
and 37 GHz emission. The measured lags $\tau^{\rm{uv}}_{\rm{ob}}$ are of the
order of years. For a given line, $\tau^{\rm{uv}}_{\rm{ob}}$ decreases as the
radio frequency increases. This trend results from the radiative cooling of
relativistic electrons. Both UV lines have a lag of
$\tau^{\rm{uv}}_{\rm{ob}}=-2.74^{+0.06}_{-0.25}$ yr relative to the 37 GHz
emission. These results are consistent with those derived from the Balmer lines
in Paper I. Second, we derive the time lags of the lines Ly$\alpha$, CIV,
H$\gamma$, H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ relative to the 37 GHz emission by the FR/RSS
Monte Carlo method. The measured lags are
$\tau_{\rm{ob}}=-3.40^{+0.31}_{-0.05}$, $-3.40^{+0.41}_{-0.14}$,
$-2.06^{+0.36}_{-0.92}$, $-3.40^{+1.15}_{-0.20}$ and $-3.56^{+0.35}_{-0.18}$ yr
for the lines Ly$\alpha$, CIV, H$\gamma$, H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$, respectively.
These estimated lags are consistent with those derived by the ZDCF method

$R^{\rm{uv}}_{\rm{BLR}}=2.54^{+0.71}_{-0.35}$--$4.01^{+0.90}_{-1.16}$ and
$2.54^{+0.80}_{-0.43}$--$4.01^{+0.98}_{-1.24}$ light-years for the Ly$\alpha$
and CIV lines, respectively. Considering the uncertainties, these estimated
sizes are consistent with those obtained in the classical reverberation mapping
for the UV lines and the Balmer lines. This indicates that their emitting
regions are not separated so large as in the classical mapping of the UV and
optical lines. These results seem to depart from the stratified ionization
structures obtained in the classical mapping.

operational framework to understand and diagnose financial bubbles from
rational expectations and was recently extended to negative bubbles and
rebounds. Using the JLS model, we develop an alarm index based on an advanced
pattern recognition method with the aim of detecting bubbles and performing
forecasts of market crashes and rebounds. Testing our methodology on 10 major
global equity markets, we show quantitatively that our developed alarm performs
much better than chance in forecasting market crashes and rebounds. We use the
derived signal to develop elementary trading strategies that produce

effects leave a clear signature on the spectrum, namely, an over-production of

use of entanglement monogamy to incorporate an unknown state in a multipartite

teleportation protocol in an appropriate measurement basis, which results with
the receiver in the possession of an unknown state, connected by local unitary
transformation with the state to be teleported. This procedure succeeds in a
number of cases, like that of W and other non-maximally entangled four qubit
states, where the conventional measurement based approach has failed. It is
also found that in certain four particle channels, the present procedure does
not succeed, although the conventional one works well.
