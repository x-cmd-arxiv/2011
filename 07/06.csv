and stellar populations of the northern outer part of the stellar halo in
NGC55, a member galaxy of the Sculptor Group, using deep and wide-field V- and
I-band images taken with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. Based on the analysis of the
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for red-giant-branch (RGB) stars, we derive a
tip of RGB (TRGB)-based distance modulus to the galaxy of (m-M)_0 = 26.58 +/-
0.11 (d = 2.1 +/- 0.1 Mpc). From the stellar density maps, we detect the
asymmetrically disturbed, thick disk structure and two metal-poor overdense
substructures in the north region of NGC55, which may correspond to merger
remnants associated with hierarchical formation of NGC55's halo. In addition,
we identify a diffuse metal-poor halo extended out to at least z ~ 16 kpc from
the galactic plane. The surface-brightness profiles toward the z-direction
perpendicular to the galactic plane suggest that the stellar density
distribution in the northern outer part of NGC55 is described by a locally
isothermal disk at z <~ 6 kpc and a likely diffuse metal-poor halo with V-band
surface brightness of mu_V >~ 32 mag arcsec^{-2}, where old RGB stars dominate.
We derive the metallicity distributions (MDs) of these structures on the basis
of the photometric comparison of RGB stars with the theoretical stellar
evolutionary models. The MDs of the thick disk structures show the peak and
mean metallicity of [Fe/H]peak ~ -1.4 and [Fe/H]mean ~ -1.7, respectively,
while the outer substructures show more metal-poor features than the thick disk
structure. Combined with the current results with our previous study for M31's
halo, we discuss the possible difference in the formation process of stellar
halos among different Hubble types.

system formed by two rather similar solar type stars with a projected
separation of 4.1 arcsec, which corresponds to 400 AU at the distance of 96 pc.
The two components are moderately metal-poor and the age of the system is about
5 Gyr. We detected RV variations of HD 132563B with period of 1544 days and
semi-amplitude of 26 m/s. From the star characteristics and line profile
measurements, we infer their Keplerian origin. Therefore HD 132563B turns out
to host a planet with a projected mass msini=1.49 MJup at 2.6 AU with a
moderately eccentric orbit (e=0.22). The planet around HD 132563B is one of the
few that are known in triple stellar systems, as we found that the primary HD
132563A is itself a spectroscopic binary with a period longer than 15 years and
an eccentricity higher than 0.65. The spectroscopic component was not detected
in adaptive-optics images taken with AdOpt@TNG, since it expected at a
projected separation that was smaller than 0.2 arcsec at the time of our
observations. A small excess in K band difference between the components with
respect to the difference in V band is compatible with a companion of about
0.55 Msun. A preliminary statistical analysis of the occurrence of planets in
triple systems indicate a similar frequency of planets around the isolated
component in a triple system, components of wide binaries and single stars.
There is no significant iron abundance difference between the components. The
lack of stars in binary systems and open clusters showing strong enhancements
of iron abundance, comparable to the typical metallicity difference between
stars with and without giant planets, agrees with the idea that accretion of
planetary material producing iron abundance anomalies larger than 0.1 dex is
rare.

factor of 2 - 4. The integral below the perturbation profile remains basically
constant in two cases, while it shows a decrease by a factor of 3 - 4 in the

slowly fading away. Our findings indicate that the events under study are weak

massive young stellar object (~10 Msun). Although strong infrared excess
clearly shows that the central object is surrounded by large amounts of
circumstellar material, no information about the spatial distribution of this
circumstellar material has been available until now. We used the ESO Very Large
Telescope Interferometer to perform long-baseline interferometric observations
of NGC 2264 IRS 1 in the mid-infrared regime. Our observations resolve the
circumstellar material around NGC 2264 IRS 1, provide the first direct
measurement of the angular size of the mid-infrared emission, and yield direct
constraints on the spatial distribution of the dust. We use different
approaches (a geometrical model, a temperature-gradient model, and radiative
transfer models) to jointly model the observed interferometric visibilities and
the spectral energy distribution. The derived visibility values between ~0.02
and ~0.3 show that the mid-infrared emission is clearly resolved. The
characteristic size of the MIR-emission region is ~30-60 AU; this value is
typical for other YSOs with similar or somewhat lower luminosities. A
comparison of the sizes for the two position angles shows a significant
elongation of the dust distribution. Simple spherical envelope models are
therefore inconsistent with the data. The radiative transfer modeling of our
data suggests that we observe a geometrically thin and optically thick
circumstellar disk with a mass of about 0.1 Msun. Our modeling indicates that
NGC 2264 IRS 1 is surrounded by a flat circumstellar disk that has properties
similar to disks typically found around lower-mass young stellar objects. This
result supports the assumption that massive young stellar objects form via
accretion from circumstellar disks.

started to continuously survey the Outgoing Long-wavelength Radiation (OLR,
10-13 microns) from NOAA/AVHRR. Our preliminary results show the presence of
hot spots on the top of the atmosphere over the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power
Plant (FDNPP) and due to their persistence over the same region they are most
likely not of meteorological origin. On March 14 and 21 we detected a
significant increase in radiation (14 W/m2) at the top of the atmosphere which
also coincides with a reported radioactivity gas leaks from the FDNPP. After
March 21 the intensity of OLR started to decline, which has been confirmed by
ground radiometer network. We hypothesize that this increase in OLR was a
result of the radioactive leaks released in atmosphere from the FDNPP. This
energy triggers ionization of the air near the ground and lead to release of
latent heat energy due to change of air humidity and temperature. Our early
results demonstrate the potential of the latest development in atmospheric
sciences and space-borne observations for monitoring nuclear accidents.

Chandra and XMM-Newoton. This new analysis of Abell S1101 indicate that the
1/4keV band emission is compatible with the presence of WHIM filaments
connected to the cluster and extending outward into the intergalactic medium;
the temperatures we find in this study are typically lower than the WHIM probed

compatible with a non-thermal origin as the inverse Compton scattering of
relativistic electrons off the cosmic microwave background, with pressure less

U(2) a projective quadric in six-dimensional real space of signature (4,2) and
as the Grassmannian of maximal totally isotropic subspaces in complex
four--dimensional twistor space. Explicit relations between these
representations are given, using a concrete representation of antilinear action
of the conformal Clifford algebra Cl(4,2) on twistors. Concepts of space-time

conformal infinity is faithfully represented by planes in 3D real space plus
the infinity point. Closed null geodesics trapped at infinity are represented

disambiguation of the principle that measuring an observable determines one of

unitary transformation of a random quantum measurement outcome shows that: (i)
finding the characteristic of the function on the part of Alice is a by-product
of reconstructing Bob's choice and (ii) because of the quantum correlation

determined by the action of Bob (initial measurement and successive unitary

implies that quantum algorithms are superpositions of histories in each of

Performing, in each history, only the function evaluations required to
classically reconstruct Bob's choice given the advanced knowledge of half of it

interleaving function evaluations with non-computational unitary
transformations that each time maximize the amount of information about Bob's

accounting for the leading order nonlinear corrections to linear tidal theory.
These nonlinear corrections include two distinct effects: three-mode nonlinear
interactions and nonlinear excitation of modes by the time-varying
gravitational potential of the companion. This paper presents the formalism for
studying nonlinear tides and studies the nonlinear stability of the linear
tidal flow. Although the formalism is applicable to binaries containing stars,
planets, or compact objects, we focus on solar type stars with stellar or
planetary companions. Our primary results include: (1) The linear tidal
solution often used in studies of binary evolution is unstable over much of the
parameter space in which it is employed. More specifically, resonantly excited
gravity waves are unstable to parametric resonance for companion masses M' >
10-100 M_Earth at orbital periods P = 1-10 days. The nearly static equilibrium
tide is, however, parametrically stable except for solar binaries with P < 2-5
days. (2) For companion masses larger than a few Jupiter masses, the dynamical
tide causes waves to grow so rapidly that they must be treated as traveling
waves rather than standing waves. (3) We find a novel form of parametric
instability in which a single parent wave excites a very large number of
daughter waves (N = 10^3[P / 10 days]) and drives them as a single coherent
unit with growth rates that are ~N times faster than the standard three wave
parametric instability. (4) Independent of the parametric instability, tides
excite a wide range of stellar p-modes and g-modes by nonlinear inhomogeneous
forcing; this coupling appears particularly efficient at draining energy out of
the dynamical tide and may be more important than either wave breaking or
parametric resonance at determining the nonlinear dissipation of the dynamical
tide.

  Commun. Math. Phys",,,,"gr-qc math.AP math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We initiate the mathematical study of spherical collapse of self-gravitating
charged scalar fields. The main result gives a complete characterization of the
future boundary of spacetime, providing a starting point for studying the
cosmic censorship conjectures. In general, the boundary includes two null
components, one emanating from the center of symmetry and the other from the
future limit point of null infinity, joined by an achronal component to which
the area-radius function r extends continuously to zero. Various components of
the boundary, a priori, may be empty and establishing such generic emptiness
would suffice to prove formulations of weak or strong cosmic censorship. As a
simple corollary of the boundary characterization, the present paper rules out
scenarios of 'naked singularity' formation by means of 'super-charging'
(near-)extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes. The main difficulty in
delimiting the boundary is isolated in proving a suitable global extension
principle that effectively excludes a broad class of singularity formation.
This suggests a new notion of 'strongly tame' matter models, which we introduce
in this paper. The boundary characterization proven here extends to any such
'strongly tame' Einstein-matter system.

response to the call for M3 mission proposals. The concept centres around an
X-ray telescope of unprecedented effective area, which will focus radiation
emitted from close to the event horizon of black holes or the surface of
neutron stars. To reveal the nature and behaviour of matter in the most extreme
astrophysical environments, GRAVITAS targets a key feature in the X-ray spectra
of compact objects: the iron Kalpha line at ~6.5 keV. The energy, profile, and
variability of this emission line, and the properties of the surrounding
continuum emission, shaped by General Relativity (GR) effects, provide a unique
probe of gravity in its strong field limit. Among its prime targets are
hundreds of supermassive black holes in bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),
which form the perfect laboratory to help understand the physical processes
behind black hole growth. Accretion plays a fundamental role in the shaping of
galaxies throughout cosmic time, via the process of feedback. Modest
(~sub-arcmin) spatial resolution would deliver the necessary sensitivity to
extend high quality X-ray spectroscopy of AGN to cosmologically-relevant
distances. Closer to home, ultra-high count rate capabilities and
sub-millisecond time resolution enable the study of GR effects and the equation
of state of dense matter in the brightest X-ray binaries in our own Galaxy,
using multiple probes, such as the broad iron line, the shape of the disk
continuum emission, quasi-periodic oscillations, reverberation mapping, and
X-ray burst oscillations. Despite its breakthrough capabilities, all enabling
technologies for GRAVITAS are already in a high state of readiness. It is based
on ultra light-weight X-ray optics and a focal plane detector using silicon
technology.

(from emission-lines in their 2D spectra) and find that they are more frequent
in clusters than in the field. The fraction of kinematically-disturbed galaxies
increases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from the
cluster centre, but remains constant with projected galaxy density. We also
studied morphological disturbances in the stellar light from HST/F814W images,
finding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar in
all environments. Moreover, there is little correlation between the presence of
kinematically-disturbed gas and morphological distortions. We also study the
dependence of the Tully-Fisher relation, star formation, and extent of the
emission on environment, and conclude that the gas disks in cluster galaxies
have been truncated, and therefore their star formation is more concentrated
than in low-density environments. If spirals transform into S0s, our findings
imply that the physical mechanism transforming cluster galaxies efficiently
disturbs the star-forming gas and reduces their specific star formation rate.
Moreover, this star-forming gas is either removed more efficiently from the
outskirts of the galaxies or is driven towards the centre (or both), helping to
build the bulges of S0s. These results, in addition to the finding that the
transformation mechanism does not seem to induce strong morphological
disturbances on the galaxies, suggest that the physical processes involved are
related to the intracluster medium, with galaxy-galaxy interactions playing
only a limited role in clusters.

political theory that to date has been elaborated in strictly classical
language and formalisms but has complex features that seem to merit
generalizations of the problem outside the confines of classicality. The line
of research, initiated by Fiorina in the 1980s, seeks to understand the origins
and nature of party governance in two-party political systems wherein voters
cast partisan ballots in two contests, one that determines partisan control of
the executive branch and another that determines party control of a
legislature. We describe how research in this area evolved in the last two
decades in directions that bring it now to the point where further elaboration
and study seem natural in the more general formalistic and philosophical
environments embraced in QI research. In the process, we find evidence that a
restriction of a classical model that has animated work in the field appears
violated in a form that leads one naturally to embrace the superposition
principle. We then connect classical distinctions between separable and
nonseparable preferences that are common in political science to their quantum
and quantum-like counterparts in the QI literature, finding special affinity
for a recently-introduced understanding of the distinction that provides a
passageway into the boundary between fully quantum and fully classical views of
the distinction and thereby provides new leverage on existing work germane to
the theory.

studied in the past years through different methods. In the next years the
up-coming generation of radio telescopes is going to provide new data that have
the potential of setting constraints on the properties of magnetic fields in
galaxy clusters. Here we present zoomed-in simulations for a set of massive
galaxy clusters (M_v > 10^15 M_sun/h). This is an ideal sample to study the
evolution of magnetic field during the process of structure formation in
detail. Turbulent motions of the gas within the ICM will manifest themselves in
a macroscopic magnetic resistivity eta_m, which has to be taken explicitly into
account, especially at scales below the resolution limit. We have adapted the
MHD GADGET code by Dolag & Stasyszyn (2009) to include the treatment of the
magnetic resistivity and for the first time we have included non-ideal MHD
equations to better follow the evolution of the magnetic field within galaxy
clusters. We investigate which value of the magnetic resistivity eta_m is
required to match the magnetic field profile derived from radio observations.
We find that a value of eta_m ~ 6 10^27 cm^2/s is necessary to recover the
shape of the magnetic field profile inferred from radio observations of the
Coma cluster. This value agrees well with the expected level of turbulent
motions within the ICM at our resolution limit. The magnetic field profiles can
be fitted by a beta-model like profile (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1976), with
small dispersion of the parameters. We find also that that the temperature,
density and entropy profiles of the clusters depend on the magnetic resistivity
constant, having flatter profiles in the inner regions when the magnetic
resistivity increases.

follow the same Schmidt-Kennicutt (KS) relation as in spiral disks, presenting
a higher star formation rate (SFR) for a given gas column density. In this
paper we study why and how different models of star formation arise. To do so
we examine the process of star formation in the interacting system Arp 158 and
its tidal debris. We perform an analysis of the properties of specific regions
of interest in Arp 158 using observations tracing the atomic and the molecular
gas, star formation, the stellar populations as well as optical spectroscopy to
determine their exact nature. We also fit their spectral energy distribution
with an evolutionary synthesis code. Finally, we compare star formation in
these objects to star formation in the disks of spiral galaxies and mergers.
Abundant molecular gas is found throughout the system and the tidal tails
appear to have many young stars compared to their old stellar content. One of
the nuclei is dominated by a starburst whereas the other is an active nucleus.
We estimate the SFR throughout the system and find that most regions follow
closely the KS relation seen in spiral galaxies with the exception of the
nuclear starburst and the tip of one of the tails. We examine whether this
diversity is due to uncertainties in the manner the SFR is determined or
whether the conditions in the nuclear starburst region are such that it does
not follow the same KS law as other regions. Observations of the interacting
system Arp 158 provide the first evidence in a resolved fashion that different
star-forming regions in a merger may be following different KS laws. This
suggests that the physics of the interstellar medium at a scale no larger than
1 kpc, the size of the largest gravitational instabilities and the injection
scale of turbulence, determines the origin of these laws.

affect the dust production and hence detectability of the disk. We tabulated
the fractions of planetesimals stripped off during stellar flybys of miss

cloud in turbulence, shape, and density structure. Aims. We aim to understand
how dense cores form out of the less dense cloud material by studying the
connection between these two regimes. Methods. We observed the L1517 dark cloud
in C18O(1-0), N2H+(1-0), and SO(JN=32-21) with the FCRAO 14m telescope, and in
the 1.2mm dust continuum with the IRAM 30m telescope. Results. Most of the gas
in the cloud lies in four filaments that have typical lengths of 0.5 pc. Five
starless cores are embedded in these filaments and have chemical compositions
indicative of different evolutionary stages. The filaments have radial profiles
of C18O(1-0) emission with a central flattened region and a power-law tail, and
can be fitted approximately as isothermal, pressure-supported cylinders. The
filaments, in addition, are extremely quiescent. They have subsonic internal
motions and are coherent in velocity over their whole length. The large-scale
motions in the filaments can be used to predict the velocity inside the cores,
indicating that core formation has not decoupled the dense gas kinematically
from its parental material. In two filaments, these large-scale motions consist
of oscillations in the velocity centroid, and a simple kinematic model suggests
that they may be related to core-forming flows. Conclusions. Core formation in
L1517 seems to have occurred in two steps. First, the subsonic,
velocity-coherent filaments have condensed out of the more turbulent ambient
cloud. Then, the cores fragmented quasi-statically and inherited the kinematics
of the filaments. Turbulence dissipation has therefore occurred mostly on
scales on the order of 0.5 pc or larger, and seems to have played a small role
in the formation of the individual cores.

Function (VDF) from z=0 to z=1.5 using photometric data from the UKIDSS Ultra
Deep Survey (UDS) and Newfirm Medium Band Survey (NMBS) COSMOS surveys. The VDF
has been measured locally using direct kinematic measurements from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, but direct studies of the VDF at high redshift are
difficult as they require velocity dispersion measurements of many thousands of
galaxies. Taylor et al. (2010) demonstrated that dynamical and stellar mass are
linearly related when the structure of the galaxy is accounted for. We show
that the stellar mass, size and S\'ersic index can reliably predict the
velocity dispersions of SDSS galaxies. We apply this relation to galaxies at
high redshift and determine the evolution of the inferred VDF. We find that the
VDF at z~0.5 is very similar to the VDF at z=0. At higher redshifts, we find
that the number density of galaxies with dispersions <~200 km/s is lower, but
the number of high dispersion galaxies is constant or even higher. At fixed
cumulative number density, the velocity dispersions of galaxies with
logN[Mpc^{-3}]<-3.5 increase with time by a factor of ~1.4 from z~1.5-0,
whereas the dispersions of galaxies with lower number density are approximately
constant or decrease with time. The VDF appears to show less evolution than the
stellar mass function, particularly at the lowest number densities. We note
that these results are still somewhat uncertain and we suggest several avenues
for further calibrating the inferred velocity dispersions.

within the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) theory. Magnetic and charge
properties are determined by systematic, large-scale, exact numerical
calculations, and quantified as a function of electron doping $h$. In the
solution of the self-consistent UHF equations, multiple initial configurations
and simulated annealing are used to facilitate convergence to the global
minimum. New approaches are employed to minimize finite-size effects in order
to reach the thermodynamic limit. At low to moderate interacting strengths and
low doping, the UHF ground state is a linear spin-density wave (l-SDW), with
antiferromagnetic order and a modulating wave. The wavelength of the modulating
wave is $2/h$. Corresponding charge order exists but is substantially weaker
than the spin order, hence holes are mobile. As the interaction is increased,
the l-SDW states evolves into several different phases, with the holes
eventually becoming localized. A simple pairing model is presented with
analytic calculations for low interaction strength and small doping, to help
understand the numerical results and provide a physical picture for the
properties of the SDW ground state. By comparison with recent many-body
calculations, it is shown that, for intermediate interactions, the UHF solution
provides a good description of the magnetic correlations in the true ground
state of the Hubbard model.

investigate particle acceleration and magnetic field dissipation at the

compresses and the alternating fields annihilate by driven magnetic
reconnection. Irrespective of the stripe wavelength ""lambda"" or the wind
magnetization ""sigma"" (in the regime sigma>>1 of magnetically-dominated flows),
shock-driven reconnection transfers all the magnetic energy of alternating
fields to the particles, whose average Lorentz factor increases by a factor of
sigma with respect to the pre-shock value. The shape of the post-shock spectrum
depends primarily on the ratio lambda/(r_L*sigma), where r_L is the
relativistic Larmor radius in the wind. The spectrum becomes broader as the
value of lambda/(r_L*sigma) increases, passing from a relativistic Maxwellian
to a flat power-law tail with slope around -1.5, populated by particles
accelerated by the reconnection electric field. Close to the equatorial plane
of the wind, where the stripes are symmetric, the highest energy particles
resulting from magnetic reconnection can escape ahead of the shock, and be
injected into a Fermi-like acceleration process. In the post-shock spectrum,
they populate a power-law tail with slope around -2.5, that extends beyond the
flat component produced by reconnection. Our study suggests that the spectral
break between the radio and the optical band in Pulsar Wind Nebulae can be a
natural consequence of particle acceleration at the termination shock of
striped pulsar winds.

The model predicts a small negative asymmetry for t-tbar pairs with invariant

arises from interference between s-channel gluon and axigluon diagrams and
requires a relatively weakly coupled axigluon ($g_{a} = g_{qcd}/3$).
Axigluon-gluon interference does not contribute to the t-tbar cross section.
New contributions to the cross section arise only at fourth order in the
axigluon coupling and are very small for a sufficiently broad axigluon. Dijet
measurements do not significantly constrain the axigluon couplings. We propose
several possible UV completions of the phenomenological axigluon which explain

contain new colored fermions or scalars below the axigluon mass and predict

provide alternative interpretations of the proposed indices to reveal their
true topological characteristics: first, in terms of forced detour overheads

voltage distributions in the equivalent electrical network; and then as the
average connectedness of $i$ in all the bi-partitions of the graph. These

(NR) it has become possible to construct inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms by
combining both descriptions into one hybrid signal. While addressing the
reliability of such waveforms, previous studies have identified the PN
contribution as the dominant source of error, which can be reduced by
incorporating longer NR simulations. Here we overcome the two outstanding
issues that make it difficult to determine the minimum NR simulation length
necessary to produce suitably accurate hybrids: (1) the criteria for a GW
search is the mismatch between the true waveform and a set of model waveforms,
optimized over all waveforms in the model, but for discrete hybrids this
optimization was not yet possible. (2) these calculations typically require
that numerical waveforms already exist, while we develop an algorithm to
estimate hybrid mismatches errors without numerical data. Our procedure relies
on combining supposedly equivalent PN models at highest available order with
common data in the NR regime, and their difference serves as a measure of the
uncertainty assumed in each waveform. Contrary to some earlier studies, we
estimate that ~10 NR orbits before merger should allow for the construction of
waveform families that are accurate enough for detection in a broad range of
parameters, only excluding highly spinning, unequal-mass systems. Nonspinning
systems, even with high mass-ratio (q>=20) are well modeled for astrophysically
reasonable component masses. The parameter bias is only of the order of 1% for
total mass and symmetric mass-ratio and less than 0.1 for the dimensionless
spin magnitude. We take the view that similar NR waveform lengths will remain
the state of the art in the advanced detector era, and begin to assess the
limits of the science that can be done with them.

Data-driven models aim at a granularity down to the level of households or
single individuals. However, relatively little systematic work has been done to
provide coupled behavior-disease models able to close the feedback loop between
behavioral changes triggered in the population by an individual's perception of
the disease spread and the actual disease spread itself. While models lacking
this coupling can be extremely successful in mild epidemics, they obviously
will be of limited use in situations where social disruption or behavioral
alterations are induced in the population by knowledge of the disease. Here we
propose a characterization of a set of prototypical mechanisms for
self-initiated social distancing induced by local and non-local
prevalence-based information available to individuals in the population. We
characterize the effects of these mechanisms in the framework of a
compartmental scheme that enlarges the basic SIR model by considering separate
behavioral classes within the population. The transition of individuals in/out
of behavioral classes is coupled with the spreading of the disease and provides
a rich phase space with multiple epidemic peaks and tipping points. The class
of models presented here can be used in the case of data-driven computational
approaches to analyze scenarios of social adaptation and behavioral change.

for causal heat transport. A comparison with the Israel and Stewart model is
presented and its equivalence is shown. This discussion provides new insights

counterexample to Bell's theorem. This counterexample does not have the same
assumptions as the original Bell's theorem, and therefore it does not represent
a genuine disproof in a strict mathematical sense. However, assuming the
physical relevance of the new assumptions, the counterexample is shown to be a
contextual hidden variable theory. If Bell's theorem's importance is to rule
out contextual hidden variable theories obeying relativistic locality, then Joy
Christian's counterexample achieves its aim. If however contextual hidden
variables theories are not considered genuine physically theories and Bell's
theorem's importance stems from its ability to be experimentally confirmed,
then Joy Christian's counterexample does not diminish the importance of Bell's
theorem. The implications of Joy Christian's counterexample are discussed in
the context of information theory.
  Version 2 note: Subsequent analysis disproved the mathematical consistency of
Joy Christian's model. This paper was based on the assumption of the
mathematical validity of the model. Except for the addition of this note, the

the maximum (min-max) or the sum (min-sum) of the Euclidean distances traveled
by the points is minimized. The problems have applications, e.g., in mobile
sensor barrier coverage of wireless sensor networks. The min-max problem
further has two versions: the decision version and optimization version. For
the min-max problem, we present an $O(n\log^2 n)$ time algorithm for the

$O(n^{3.5})$ time and $O(n^{3.5}\log n)$ time, respectively. For the min-sum

find a transformation that under A3w makes c-convex functions level-set convex
(as was also obtained independently from us by Liu \cite{Liu09}). We then
derive new Alexandrov type estimates for the level-set convex c-convex
functions, and a topological lemma showing optimal maps do not mix interior
with boundary. This topological lemma, which does not require A3w, is needed by
Figalli and Loeper \cite{FigalliLoeper08p} to conclude continuity of optimal
maps in two dimensions. In higher dimensions, if the densities f^\pm are
H\""older continuous, our result permits continuous differentiability of the map

strength does not depend only on the quantity and quality of bone which is
characterized by the geometry and the shape of bones but also on the mechanical
proprieties of its compounds, which have a significant influence on its
deformation and failure. This work aim to use a 3D nano-scale finite element
model coupled to the concept of quasi-brittle damage with the behaviour law
isotropic elasticity to investigate the fracture behaviour of composite
materiel collagen-mineral (mineralized collagen microfibril). Fracture
stress-number of cross-links and damping capacity-number of cross-links curves
were obtained under tensile loading conditions at different densities of the
mineral phase. The obtained results show that number of cross-links as well as
the density of mineral has an important influence on the strength of
microfibrils which in turn clarify the bone fracture at macro-scale.

large sample of 691 radio galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
These radio galaxies are resolved in the FIRST survey, have redshifts less that
0.2 and radio flux densities at 1.4 GHz higher than 40 mJy. Approximately 1/3
of the sources show a significant excess (above that contributed by their
stellar populations) of Na D absorption that can be robustly fitted with two
Voigt profiles representing the Na D doublet. A further 1/6 of the sources show
residual absorption, for which the fits were not well constrained though while
~50% of the sample show no significant residual absorption. The residual
absorption is modestly blueshifted, typically by ~50 km/s, but the velocity
dispersions are high, generally ~500 km/s. Assuming that the size of the
absorbing region is consistent with ~1 kpc for dust lanes in a sample of
generally more powerful radio sources and a continuous constant velocity flow
(continuity equation), we estimate mass and energy outflow rates of about 10
Msun/yr and few x e42 erg/s. These rates are consistent with those in the
literature based on HI absorption line observations of radio galaxies. The
energy required to power these outflows is on the order of 1-10% of the jet
mechanical power and we conclude that the radio jet alone is sufficient. The
mass and energy outflow rates are consistent with what is needed to heat/expel
the mass returned by the stellar populations as well as the likely amount of
gas from a cooling halo. This suggests that radio-loud AGN play a key role in
energizing the outflow/heating phase of the feedback cycle. The deposition of
the jet mechanical energy could be important for explaining the ensemble
characteristics of massive early type galaxies in the local universe.

properties as well as to interpret their intrinsic spectral energy
distributions. In particular the presence or absence of a UV bump at 2175 A
remains an open issue which has consequences on the interpretation of broad
band colours of distant galaxies. We study the dust attenuation curve in the UV
range at z >1. In particular we search for the presence of a UV bump. We use
deep photometric data of the CDFS obtained with intermediate and broad band
filters by the MUSYC project to sample the UV rest-frame of galaxies with 1<z
<2. Herschel/PACS and Spitzer/MIPS data are used to measure the dust emission.
30 galaxies were selected with high S/N in all bands. Their SEDs from the UV to
the far-IR are fitted using the CIGALE code and the characteristics of the dust
attenuation curve are obtained. The mean dust attenuation curve we derive
exhibits a UV bump at 2175A whose amplitude corresponds to 35 % (76%) that of
the MW (LMC2 supershell) extinction curve. An analytical expression of the
average attenuation curve is given, it is found slightly steeper than the
Calzetti et al. one, although at a 1 sigma level. Our galaxy sample is used to
study the derivation of the slopes of the UV continuum from broad band colours,
including the GALEX FUV-NUV colour. Systematic errors induced by the presence
of the bump are quantified. We compare dust attenuation factors measured with
CIGALE to the slope of the UV continuum and find that there is a large scatter
around the relation valid for local starbursts (0.7 mag). The uncertainties on
the determination of the UV slope lead to an extra systematic error of the
order of 0.3 to 0.7 mag on dust attenuation when a filter overlaps the UV bump.

cubic and subcubic graphs, which is known to be NP-hard. The problem is of
interest because of its relation to the famous 4/3 conjecture for metric TSP,
which says that the integrality gap, i.e., the worst case ratio between the
optimal values of the TSP and its linear programming relaxation (the subtour
elimination relaxation), is 4/3. We present the first algorithm for cubic
graphs with approximation ratio 4/3. The proof uses polyhedral techniques in a
surprising way, which is of independent interest. In fact we prove
constructively that for any cubic graph on $n$ vertices a tour of length 4n/3-2
exists, which also implies the 4/3 conjecture, as an upper bound, for this
class of graph-TSP.
  Recently, M\""omke and Svensson presented a randomized algorithm that gives a
1.461-approximation for graph-TSP on general graphs and as a side result a
4/3-approximation algorithm for this problem on subcubic graphs, also settling
the 4/3 conjecture for this class of graph-TSP. We will present a way to
derandomize their algorithm which leads to a smaller running time than the
obvious derandomization. All of the latter also works for multi-graphs.

Multi-Object Spectrometer (HST/NICMOS) aboard the HST in the F110W filter. The
SED and images of the disk in scattered light as well as in thermal reemission
are combined in our modeling using a parameterized model for the disk density

the debris disk around HD 107146 is presented that allows us to reproduce the
almost entire set of spatially resolved and unresolved multi-wavelength
observations. Considering the variety of complementary observational data, we
are able to break the degeneracies produced by modeling SED data alone. We find
the disk to be an extended ring with a peak surface density at 131AU.
Furthermore, we find evidence for an additional, inner disk probably composed
of small grains released at the inner edge of the outer disk and moving inwards
due to Poynting-Robertson drag. A birth ring scenario (i.e., a more or less
broad ring of planetesimals creating the dust disk trough collisions) is found
to be the most likely explanation of the ringlike shape of the disk.

tetrad field is considered in this paper. Since the algebraic properties of the
tetrad field representing the gravitational field are assumed to correspond to
the noncommutativity algebra of the coordinates in the canonical case of
noncommutative geometry, this idea is closely related to noncommutative
geometry as well as to canonical quantization of gravity. According to this
presupposition generalized field equations for general relativity are derived
which are obtained by replacing the usual tetrad field by the tetrad field
operator within the actions and then building expectation values of the

increased in recent years. However, almost all known solutions solely aim at
achieving sender or requestor anonymity in DHT queries. In many application
scenarios, it is crucial that the queried key remains secret from intermediate
peers that (help to) route the queries towards their destinations. In this
paper, we satisfy this requirement by presenting an approach for providing
privacy for the keys in DHT queries.
  We use the concept of oblivious transfer (OT) in communication over DHTs to
preserve query privacy without compromising spam resistance. Although our
OT-based approach can work over any DHT, we concentrate on communication over
robust DHTs that can tolerate Byzantine faults and resist spam. We choose the
best-known robust DHT construction, and employ an efficient OT protocol
well-suited for achieving our goal of obtaining query privacy over robust DHTs.
Finally, we compare the performance of our privacy-preserving protocols with
their more privacy-invasive counterparts. We observe that there is no increase
in the message complexity and only a small overhead in the computational
complexity.

MONDian free-functions would survive a negative result. There are exceptions,
e.g. free-functions not asymptoting to 1 in the Newtonian limit, but rather
diverging or asymptoting to zero (depending on their mother relativistic
MONDian theory). Finally, we scan the structure of all proposed relativistic
MONDian theories, and classify them with regards to their non-relativistic

to classical physics. There is a state object, analogous to the state space of
a classical system, and a quantity-value object, generalising the real numbers.
Physical quantities are maps from the state object to the quantity-value object
-- hence the `values' of physical quantities are not just real numbers in this
formalism. Rather, they are families of real intervals, interpreted as `unsharp
values'. We will motivate and explain these aspects of the topos approach and
show that the structure of the quantity-value object can be analysed using
tools from domain theory, a branch of order theory that originated in
theoretical computer science. Moreover, the base category of the topos
associated with a quantum system turns out to be a domain if the underlying von
Neumann algebra is a matrix algebra. For general algebras, the base category
still is a highly structured poset. This gives a connection between the topos
approach, noncommutative operator algebras and domain theory. In an outlook, we
present some early ideas on how domains may become useful in the search for new
models of (quantum) space and space-time.

as a useful operation. In this paper we propose distributed algorithms for
sampling networks, so that nodes are selected by a special node, called the
\emph{source}, with a given probability distribution. All these algorithms are
based on a new class of random walks, that we call Random Centrifugal Walks
(RCW). A RCW is a random walk that starts at the source and always moves away
from it.
  Firstly, an algorithm to sample any connected network using RCW is proposed.
The algorithm assumes that each node has a weight, so that the sampling process
must select a node with a probability proportional to its weight. This
algorithm requires a preprocessing phase before the sampling of nodes. In
particular, a minimum diameter spanning tree (MDST) is created in the network,
and then nodes' weights are efficiently aggregated using the tree. The good
news are that the preprocessing is done only once, regardless of the number of
sources and the number of samples taken from the network. After that, every
sample is done with a RCW whose length is bounded by the network diameter.
  Secondly, RCW algorithms that do not require preprocessing are proposed for
grids and networks with regular concentric connectivity, for the case when the
probability of selecting a node is a function of its distance to the source.
  The key features of the RCW algorithms (unlike previous Markovian approaches)
are that (1) they do not need to warm-up (stabilize), (2) the sampling always
finishes in a number of hops bounded by the network diameter, and (3) it
selects a node with the exact probability distribution.

and estimated the Lyalpha flux to disentangle the contributions from different
components in this spectral region. The observations reveal prominent
variability above 8 GHz. In the optical-UV band, the variability amplitude
decreases with increasing frequency due to a steadier radiation from both a
broad line region and an accretion disc. The optical flux reaches nearly the
same levels in the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 observing seasons; the mm one shows
similar behaviour, whereas the gamma and X-ray flux levels rise in the second
period. Two prominent gamma-ray flares in mid 2008 and late 2009 show a
double-peaked structure, with a variable gamma/optical flux ratio. The X-ray
flux variations seem to follow the gamma-ray and optical ones by about 0.5 and
1 d, respectively. We interpret the multifrequency behaviour in terms of an
inhomogeneous curved jet, where synchrotron radiation of increasing wavelength
is produced in progressively outer and wider jet regions, which can change
their orientation in time. In particular, we assume that the long-term
variability is due to this geometrical effect. By combining the optical and mm
light curves to fit the gamma and X-ray ones, we find that the gamma (X-ray)
emission may be explained by inverse-Comptonisation of synchrotron optical (IR)
photons by their parent relativistic electrons (SSC process). A slight,
variable misalignment between the synchrotron and Comptonisation zones would
explain the increased gamma and X-ray flux levels in 2009-2010, as well as the
change in the gamma/optical flux ratio during the outbursts peaks.

sums of these $N$ $\,(d+1)$-valued random variables correspond to a
$d-$dimensional probabilistic model, and generalizes a recently proposed
one-dimensional ($d=1$) model having $q-$Gaussians (with $q=(\nu-2)/(\nu-1)$

Gaussian distribution for $N\to\infty$. For any $\nu$, the conditional
distributions of the $d-$dimensional model are shown to yield the corresponding
joint distribution of the $(d-1)$-dimensional model with the same $\nu$. For
the $d=2$ case, we study the joint probability distribution, and identify two
classes of marginal distributions, one of them being asymmetric and
scale-invariant, while the other one is symmetric and only asymptotically
scale-invariant. The present probabilistic model is proposed as a testing
ground for a deeper understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions
for having $q$-Gaussian attractors in the $N\to\infty$ limit, the ultimate goal

extra vector-like states, that are responsible for the radiative breaking of

correlation between the energy of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature

observations during 1996-2005, the inverse dependence was found: the energy of
the cyclotron line increases as the luminosity increases. The X-ray flux
measured by the RXTE/ASM (2-10 keV) has been assumed to represent the
luminosity - more precisely: the maximum X-ray flux reached during the
respective 35 d Main-On. Here, we question whether the ASM flux is really an
accurate measure of the bolometric luminosity of the source. We redetermined
the energy of the cyclotron line and performed spectral fits using the combined

real-valued vector. However, for many quantities, most notably orientations in
3D, S is not a vector space, but a so-called manifold, i.e. it behaves like a
vector space locally but has a more complex global topological structure. For
integrating these quantities, several ad-hoc approaches have been proposed.
  Here, we present a principled solution to this problem where the structure of
the manifold S is encapsulated by two operators, state displacement [+]:S x R^n
--> S and its inverse [-]: S x S --> R^n. These operators provide a local
vector-space view \delta; --> x [+] \delta; around a given state x. Generic
estimation algorithms can then work on the manifold S mainly by replacing +/-
with [+]/[-] where appropriate. We analyze these operators axiomatically, and
demonstrate their use in least-squares estimation and the Unscented Kalman

engineering perspective in the Manifold Toolkit, where the [+]/[-] operators
mediate between a ""flat-vector"" view for the generic algorithm and a

the degree p subextensions over K of Mp,2, the maximal abelian totally, wildly
and weakly ramified extension of K, whose norm group contains p. Our
construction follows Pickett's, who dealt with the same set M of extensions of
K, but does not depend on the choice of a basis of the residue field k of K.
Instead it furnishes a one-to-one correspondence, commuting with the action of
the Galois group of K/Qp, from the projective space of k onto M. We describe
very precisely the norm group of the extensions in M. When K is not equal to
Qp, their compositum Mp,2 yields an interesting example of non abelian weakly
ramified extension of Qp, with Galois group isomorphic to a wreath product.
Finally we show that, with a slight modification, our over-convergent
exponential power series endow certain differential modules with a Frobenius
structure, generalising a result of Pulita. Unfortunately, they then lose the
property we need to build self-dual normal basis generators, hence the
desirable link between Galois module structure and differential modules is not

multi-party conferencing solution specifically designed to achieve our

of maintaining centrally administered servers. It is designed to deliver video
with low end-to-end delays, at quality levels commensurate with available
network resources over arbitrary network topologies where bottlenecks can be
anywhere in the network. This is in contrast to commonly assumed P2P scenarios
where bandwidth bottlenecks reside only at the edge of the network. The
highlight in our design is a distributed and adaptive rate control protocol,
that can discover and adapt to arbitrary topologies and network conditions
quickly, converging to efficient link rate allocations allowed by the
underlying network. In accordance with adaptive link rate control, source video
encoding rates are also dynamically controlled to optimize video quality in
arbitrary and unpredictable network conditions. We have implemented Celerity in

dark matter and dark energy -- both unkown in laboratory physics and both

single fluid, has been proposed. Dissipation is a common phenomenon in nature
and it thus seems natural to consider models dominated by a viscous dark fluid.
We focus on the study of bulk viscosity, as isotropy and homogeneity at large
scales implies the suppression of shear viscosity, heat flow and diffusion. The
generic ansatz $\xi \propto \rho^{\nu}$ for the coefficient of bulk viscosity
($\rho$ denotes the mass/energy density), which for $\nu = - 1/2$ mimics the
$\Lambda$CDM background evolution, offers excellent fits to supernova and H(z)
data. We show that viscous dark fluids suffer from large contributions to the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (generalising a previous study by Li & Barrow)
and a suppression of structure growth at small-scales (as seen from a
generalized Meszaros equation). Based on recent observations, we conclude that
viscous dark fluid models (with $\xi \propto \rho^{\nu}$ and neglecting
baryons) are strongly challenged.

from two opposite coexisting problems: the tendency to merge small subgraphs,
which dominates when the resolution is low; the tendency to split large
subgraphs, which dominates when the resolution is high. In benchmark networks
with heterogeneous distributions of cluster sizes, the simultaneous elimination
of both biases is not possible and multiresolution modularity is not capable to

algorithms for this problem has attracted intensive research activities. We
introduce an algorithmic framework, called ConGradU, that unifies a variety of
seemingly different algorithms that have been derived from disparate
approaches, and allows for deriving new schemes. Building on the old and
well-known conditional gradient algorithm, ConGradU is a simplified version
with unit step size and yields a generic algorithm which either is given by an
analytic formula or requires a very low computational complexity. Mathematical
properties are systematically developed and numerical experiments are given.

nets, a powerful formalism for real- time systems where time constraints are
expressed as intervals, representing possible transition firing times, whose
bounds are functions of marking's time description. The technique consists of
building a symbolic reachability graph relying on a sort of time coverage, and
overcomes the limitations of the only available analyzer for TB nets, based in
turn on a time-bounded inspection of a (possibly infinite) reachability-tree.
The graph construction algorithm has been automated by a tool-set, briefly
described in the paper together with its main functionality and analysis
capability. A running example is used throughout the paper to sketch the
symbolic graph construction. A use case describing a small real system - that
the running example is an excerpt from - has been employed to benchmark the
technique and the tool-set. The main outcome of this test are also presented in
the paper. Ongoing work, in the perspective of integrating with a
model-checking engine, is shortly discussed.

straight hollow waveguide with unit width and inner radius $\rho_0$ in the
superposition of the longitudinal uniform magnetic field $\bf B$ and
Aharonov-Bohm flux are analyzed within the framework of the scalar Helmholtz
equation under the assumption that the Robin boundary conditions at the inner
and outer confining walls contain extrapolation lengths $\Lambda_{in}$ and
$\Lambda_{out}$, respectively, with nonzero imaginary parts. It is shown that,
compared to the disk geometry, the annulus opens up additional possibilities of
varying magnetization and currents by tuning imaginary components of the Robin
parameters on each confining circumference; in particular, the possibility of
restoring a lossless longitudinal flux by zeroing imaginary part $E_i$ of the
total transverse energy $E$ is discussed. The energy $E$ turns real under
special correlation between the imaginary parts of $\Lambda_{in}$ and
$\Lambda_{out}$ with the opposite signs what physically corresponds to the
equal transverse fluxes through the inner and outer interfaces of the annulus.
In the asymptotic case of the very large radius, simple expressions are derived
and applied to the analysis of the dependence of the real energy $E$ on
$\Lambda_{in}$ and $\Lambda_{out}$. New features also emerge in the magnetic
field influence; for example, if, for the quantum disk, the imaginary energy
$E_i$ is quenched by the strong intensities $B$, then for the annulus this
takes place only when the inner Robin distance $\Lambda_{in}$ is real;
otherwise, it almost quadratically depends on $B$ with the corresponding
enhancement of the reactive scattering. Closely related problem of the hole in
the otherwise uniform medium is also addressed for real and complex
extrapolation lengths with the emphasis on the comparative analysis with its
dot counterpart.

reduces to the Bell basis. A specific property of our symmetric image coherent
states is that they never become unentangled for any value of $\psi$ from
complex plane. By the reduced density matrix and the concurrence determinant
methods, it is shown that our basis is maximally entangled. In addition we find
that the average of spin operators in these states vanish, as it must be
according to another, operational definition of completely entangled states.
Universal one qubit and two qubit gates in this new basis are calculated and
time evolution of these states for some spin systems is derived. We find that
the average energy for XYZ model in two qubit case (Q symbol of H) shows
regular finite energy localized structure with characteristic extremum points,
and appears as a soliton in maximally entangled two qubit phase space.

temperature to which it can be cooled before freezing to ice. The supercooled
liquid has been probed experimentally to near the homogeneous nucleation
temperature TH{\approx}232 K, yet the mechanism of ice crystallization -
including the size and structure of critical nuclei - has not yet been
resolved. The heat capacity and compressibility of liquid water anomalously
increase upon moving into the supercooled region according to a power law that
would diverge at Ts{\approx}225 K,(1,2) so there may be a link between water's
thermodynamic anomalies and the crystallization rate of ice. But probing this
link is challenging because fast crystallization prevents experimental studies
of the liquid below TH. And while atomistic studies have captured water
crystallization(3), the computational costs involved have so far prevented an
assessment of the rates and mechanism involved. Here we report coarse-grained
molecular simulations with the mW water model(4) in the supercooled regime
around TH, which reveal that a sharp increase in the fraction of
four-coordinated molecules in supercooled liquid water explains its anomalous
thermodynamics and also controls the rate and mechanism of ice formation. The
simulations reveal that the crystallization rate of water reaches a maximum
around 225 K, below which ice nuclei form faster than liquid water can
equilibrate. This implies a lower limit of metastability of liquid water just
below TH and well above its glass transition temperature Tg{\approx}136 K. By
providing a relationship between the structural transformation in liquid water,
its anomalous thermodynamics and its crystallization rate, this work provides a
microscopic foundation to the experimental finding that the thermodynamics of
water determines the rates of homogeneous nucleation of ice.(5)
