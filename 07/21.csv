stakeholders and may: 1) hint at gaps in a software manufacturer's Quality
Assurance (QA) processes, 2) lead to an over-load of a software manufacturer's
support and maintenance teams, and 3) consume customers' resources, leading to
a loss of reputation and a decrease in sales.
  Quantifying risk associated with the rediscovery of defects can help all of
these stake-holders. In this chapter we present a set of metrics needed to
quantify the risks. The metrics are designed to help: 1) the QA team to assess
their processes; 2) the support and maintenance teams to allocate their
resources; and 3) the customers to assess the risk associated with using the
software product. The paper includes a validation case study which applies the
risk metrics to industrial data. To calculate the metrics we use mathematical
instruments like the heavy-tailed Kappa distribution and the G/M/k queuing
model.

general outage-limited MIMO setting and in the high-rate and high-SNR limit,
both a vanishing gap to the error-performance of the (DMT optimal) exact
solution of preprocessed lattice decoding, as well as a computational
complexity that is subexponential in the number of codeword bits. The proposed
solution employs lattice reduction (LR)-aided regularized (lattice) sphere
decoding and proper timeout policies. These performance and complexity
guarantees hold for most MIMO scenarios, all reasonable fading statistics, all
channel dimensions and all full-rate lattice codes.
  In sharp contrast to the above manageable complexity, the complexity of other
standard preprocessed lattice decoding solutions is shown here to be extremely
high. Specifically the work is first to quantify the complexity of these
lattice (sphere) decoding solutions and to prove the surprising result that the
complexity required to achieve a certain rate-reliability performance, is
exponential in the lattice dimensionality and in the number of codeword bits,
and it in fact matches, in common scenarios, the complexity of ML-based
solutions. Through this sharp contrast, the work was able to, for the first
time, rigorously quantify the pivotal role of lattice reduction as a special
complexity reducing ingredient.
  Finally the work analytically refines transceiver DMT analysis which
generally fails to address potentially massive gaps between theory and
practice. Instead the adopted vanishing gap condition guarantees that the
decoder's error curve is arbitrarily close, given a sufficiently high SNR, to
the optimal error curve of exact solutions, which is a much stronger condition
than DMT optimality which only guarantees an error gap that is subpolynomial in
SNR, and can thus be unbounded and generally unacceptable in practical
settings.

A
controller compares the signal measured by a sensor with the target value. It
adjusts then an actuator in order to stabilize the signal towards its target.
Generalizing this scheme to stabilize a micro-system's quantum state relies on
quantum feedback, which must overcome a fundamental difficulty: the
measurements by the sensor have a random back-action on the system. An optimal
compromise employs weak measurements providing partial information with minimal
perturbation. The controller should include the effect of this perturbation in
the computation of the actuator's unitary operation bringing the incrementally
perturbed state closer to the target. While some aspects of this scenario have
been experimentally demonstrated for the control of quantum or classical
micro-system variables, continuous feedback loop operations permanently
stabilizing quantum systems around a target state have not yet been realized.
We have implemented such a real-time stabilizing quantum feedback scheme. It
prepares on demand photon number states (Fock states) of a microwave field in a
superconducting cavity and subsequently reverses the effects of
decoherence-induced field quantum jumps. The sensor is a beam of atoms crossing
the cavity which repeatedly performs weak quantum non-demolition measurements
of the photon number. The controller is implemented in a real-time computer
commanding the injection, between measurements, of adjusted small classical
fields in the cavity. The microwave field is a quantum oscillator usable as a
quantum memory or as a quantum bus swapping information between atoms. By
demonstrating that active control can generate non-classical states of this
oscillator and combat their decoherence, this experiment is a significant step
towards the implementation of complex quantum information operations.

for investigating how stellar angular momentum content evolves over time, how
that evolution depends on mass, and how rotation influences the stellar dynamo
and the magnetically heated chromosphere and corona. We report rotation periods
for 40 late-K to mid-M stars members of the nearby, rich, intermediate-age
(~600 Myr) open cluster Praesepe. These rotation periods were derived from ~200
observations taken by the Palomar Transient Factory of four cluster fields from
2010 February to May. Our measurements indicate that Praesepe's mass-period
relation transitions from a well-defined singular relation to a more scattered
distribution of both fast and slow rotators at ~0.6 Msun. The location of this
transition is broadly consistent with expectations based on observations of
younger clusters and the assumption that stellar-spin down is the dominant
mechanism influencing angular momentum evolution at 600 Myr. However, a
comparison to data recently published for the Hyades, assumed to be coeval to
Praesepe, indicates that the divergence from a singular mass-period relation
occurs at different characteristic masses, strengthening the finding that
Praesepe is the younger of the two clusters. We also use previously published
relations describing the evolution of rotation periods as a function of color
and mass to evolve the sample of Praesepe periods in time. Comparing the
resulting predictions to periods measured in M35 and NGC 2516 (~150 Myr) and
for kinematically selected young and old field star populations suggests that
stellar spin-down may progress more slowly than described by these relations.

low-temperature central stars. The relation between abundance and evolution is
discussed. The mid-infrared spectra of NGC1535, NGC6629, He2-108 and Tc1 taken
with the Spitzer Space Telescope are presented. These spectra are combined with
IUE and visual spectra to obtain complete extinction-corrected spectra from
which the abundances are determined. These abundances are more accurate for
several reasons, the most important is that the inclusion of the far infrared
spectra increases the number of observed ions and makes it possible to include
the nebular temperature gradient in the abundance calculation. The abundances
of these PNe are compared to those found in five other PNe of similar
properties and are further compared with predictions of evolutionary models.
From this comparison we conclude that these PNe originated from low mass stars,
probably between 1 and 2.5 solar masses and at present have core masses between
0.56 and 0.63 solar masses. A consistent description of the evolution of this
class of PNe is found that agrees with the predictions of the present nebular
abundances, the individual masses and the luminosities of these PNe. The

two-layer Maclaurin ellipsoid of revolution is compared with predictions of the
theory of figures up to third order in the small rotational parameter of the
theory of figures. An explicit formula is derived for the external
gravitational coefficient $J_2$ of the exact solution. A new approach to the
evaluation of the theory of figures based on numerical integration of ordinary
differential equations is presented. The classical Radau-Darwin formula is
found not to be valid for the rotational parameter \epsilon_2 = \Omega^2/(2\pi
G\rho_2) >= 0.17 since the formula then predicts a surface eccentricity that is
smaller than the eccentricity of the core-envelope boundary. Interface
eccentricity must be smaller than surface eccentricity. In the formula for
$\epsilon_2$, $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the two-layer body, $\rho_2$
is the density of the outer layer, and G is the gravitational constant. For an
envelope density of 3000 kg m^(-3) the failure of the Radau-Darwin formula
corresponds to a rotation period of about 3 hr. Application of the exact
solution and the theory of figures is made to models of Earth, Mars, Uranus,
and Neptune. The two-layer model with constant densities in the layers can
provide realistic approximations to terrestrial planets and icy outer planet
satellites. The two-layer model needs to be generalized to allow for a
continuous envelope (outer layer) radial density profile in order to
realistically model a gas or ice giant planet.

universe, even when the drift velocities are small. The effect is local, but
the affected scales can be large enough to give the false impression that the
whole cosmos has recently entered an accelerating phase. Generally, peculiar
velocities are also associated with dipole-like anisotropies, triggered by the
fact that they introduce a preferred spatial direction. This implies that
observers experiencing locally accelerated expansion, as a result of their own
drift motion, may also find that the acceleration is maximised in one direction
and minimised in the opposite. We argue that, typically, such a dipole
anisotropy should be relatively small and the axis should probably lie fairly
close to the one seen in the spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background.

This system has been studied previously to understand four dimensional pure
SU(N) Yang-Mills theory (YM4) through holography. In the usual treatment of the
subject, the phase transition between the AdS soliton and the black D4 brane is
interpreted as the strong coupling continuation of the
confinement/deconfinement transition in YM4. We show that this interpretation
is not valid, since the black D4 brane and the deconfinement phase of YM4 have
different realizations of the Z_N centre symmetry and cannot be identified. We
propose an alternative gravity dual of the confinement/deconfinement transition
in terms of a Gregory-Laflamme transition of the AdS soliton in the IIB frame,
where the strong coupling continuation of the deconfinement phase of YM4 is a
localized D3 soliton. Our proposal offers a new explanation of several aspects
of the thermodynamics of holographic QCD. As an example, we show a new
mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration in the Sakai-Sugimoto model. The
issues discussed in this paper pertain to gravity duals of non-supersymmetric

activity that included the giant flare of 27 December 2004 -- the most intense
extra-solar transient event ever detected at Earth. During this active episode,
we routinely monitored the source with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and
occasionally with Chandra. During the course of these observations, we
identified two relatively bright bursts observed with Konus-Wind in hard X-rays
that were followed by extended X-ray tails or afterglows lasting hundreds to
thousands of seconds. Here, we present detailed spectral and temporal analysis
of these events observed about 6 and 1.5 months prior to the 27 December 2004
Giant Flare. We find that both X-ray tails are consistent with a cooling
blackbody of constant radius. These spectral results are qualitatively similar
to those of the burst afterglows recorded from SGR 1900+14 and recently from
SGR 1550-5418. However, the latter two sources exhibit significant increase in
their pulsed X-ray intensity following the burst, while we did not detect any
significant changes in the RMS pulsed amplitude during the SGR 1806-20 events.
Moreover, we find that the fraction of energy partitioned to the burst (prompt
energy release) and the tail (afterglow) differs by an order of magnitude
between SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806-20. We suggest that such differences can be
attributed to differences in the crustal heating mechanism of these neutron

information is contained in the derivatives. Based on these results, we deduce
optimal sampling densities, optimal bandwidths and asymptotic normality of the
estimator. Simulations are conducted in order to compare the performances of
local polynomial estimators based on exact optimal bandwidths, asymptotic
optimal bandwidths, and cross-validated bandwidths.

  cosmological baryonic asymmetry?","7 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.84.073003",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the scenario of cold electroweak baryogenesis, oscillations of the Higgs
field lead to metastable domains of unbroken phase where the Higgs field nearly
vanishes. Those domains have also been identified with the $W-t-\bar{t}$ bags,
a non-topological soliton made of large number ($\sim 1000$) of gauge quanta
and heavy (top and anti-top) quarks. As real-time numerical studies had shown,
sphalerons (topological transition events violating the baryon number) occur
only inside those bags. In this work we estimate the amount of CP violation in
this scenario coming from the Standard Model, via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) quark mixing matrix, resulting in top-minus-antitop difference of the
population in the bags. Since these tops/anti-tops are ""recycled"" by
sphalerons, this population difference leads directly to the baryonic asymmetry
of the Universe. We look at the effect appearing in the 4th order in weak $W$
diagrams describing interference of different quark flavor contributions. We
found that there are multiple cancellations of diagrams and clearly
sign-definite effect appears only in the 6th order expansion over
flavor-dependent phases. We then estimate contributions to these diagrams in
which weak interaction occurs (i) inside, (ii) near and (iii) far from the
$W-t-\bar{t}$ b-bags, optimizing the contributions in each of them. We conclude
that the second (""near"") scenario is the dominant one, producing CP violation
of the order of $10^{-10}$, in our crude estimates. Together with the baryon
violation rate of about $10^{-2}$, previously demonstrated for this scenario,
it puts the resulting asymmetry close to what is needed to explain the observed
baryonic asymmetry in the Universe. Our answer also has a definite sign, which
apparently seems to be the correct one.

we further marginalize to get the marginal estimates of each node. Our proposed
block-graph construction algorithm is simple, efficient, and motivated by the
observation that approximate inference is more accurate on graphs with longer
cycles. We present extensive numerical simulations that illustrate our
block-graph framework with a variety of inference algorithms (e.g., those in
the libDAI software package). These simulations show the improvements provided

using imaging data that were obtained as part of the second Red Sequence
Cluster Survey (RCS2). In order to compare to the baryonic properties of the
lenses we focus here on the ~300 square degrees that overlap with the DR7 of
the SDSS. The depth and image quality of the RCS2 enables us to significantly
improve upon earlier work for luminous galaxies at z>=0.3. Comparison with
dynamical masses from the SDSS shows a good correlation with the lensing mass
for early-type galaxies. For low luminosity (stellar mass) early-type galaxies
we find a satellite fraction of ~40% which rapidly decreases to <10% with
increasing luminosity (stellar mass). The satellite fraction of the late-types
has a value in the range 0-15%. We find that early-types in the range
10^10<L_r<10^11.5 Lsun have virial masses that are about five times higher than
those of late-type galaxies and that the mass scales as M_200 \propto L^2.34
+0.09 \ -0.16. We also measure the virial mass-to-light ratio, and find for
L_200<10^11 Lsun a value of M_200/L_200=42+-10 for early-types, which increases
for higher luminosities to values that are consistent with those observed for
groups and clusters of galaxies. For late-type galaxies we find a lower value
of M_200/L_200=17+-9. Our measurements also show that early- and late-type
galaxies have comparable halo masses for stellar masses M_*<10^11 Msun, whereas
the virial masses of early-type galaxies are higher for higher stellar masses.
Finally, we determine the efficiency with which baryons have been converted
into stars. Our results for early-type galaxies suggest a variation in
efficiency with a minimum of ~10% for a stellar mass M_*,200=10^12 Msun. The
results for the late-type galaxies are not well constrained, but do suggest a
larger value. (abridged)

around massive black holes (MBHs). Our galaxies contain four mass groups,
representative of old stellar populations; a primary goal is to understand the
distribution of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) after the merger. Mergers are
followed using direct-summation N-body simulations, assuming a mass ratio of
1:3 and two different orbits. Evolution of the binary MBH is followed until its
separation has shrunk by a factor of 20 below the hard-binary separation.
During the galaxy merger, large cores are carved out in the stellar
distribution, with radii several times the influence radius of the massive
binary. Much of the pre-existing mass segregation is erased during this phase.
We follow the evolution of the merged galaxies for approximately three, central
relaxation times after coalescence of the massive binary; both standard, and
top-heavy, mass functions are considered. The cores that were formed in the
stellar distribution persist, and the distribution of the stellar-mass black
holes evolves against this essentially fixed background. Even after one central
relaxation time, these models look very different from the relaxed, multi-mass
models that are often assumed to describe the distribution of stars and stellar
remnants near a massive BH. While the stellar BHs do form a cusp on roughly a
relaxation time-scale, the BH density can be much smaller than in those models.
We discuss the implications of our results for the EMRI problem and for the
existence of Bahcall-Wolf cusps.

Liso Gamma_0^2, while the peak energy Epeak Gamma_0. These correlations are
less scattered in the wind density profile than in the homogeneous case. We
then study the energetics, luminosities and spectral properties of our bursts

dispersion of less than a decade in the wind case, clustering around
Liso'=5x10^48 erg/s. Peak photon energies cluster around Epeak'=6 keV. The
newly found correlations involving Gamma_0 offer a general interpretation

collimation-corrected correlation, Epeak-Egamma (obtained by correcting the

temperature and polarisation anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background

Omega_k=(1.6+-5.4)*10^{-3}, when only CMB and the LRG PS are used; the
inclusion of the other two experiments do not improve this result. Considering
the dark energy equation of state w_DE as time independent, we measure
w_DE=-1.025+-0.065, for a flat geometry, w_DE=-0.981+-0.083 otherwise. When
describing w_DE through a linear function of the scale factor, our results do
not evidence any time evolution. In the next few years new experiments will
allow to measure the clustering of galaxies with a precision much higher than

trees. When utilizing snapshots between z=20 and z=0, we find that at least 128
snapshots are required to achieve convergence to within 5% for galaxy masses.
This convergence is obtained for mean quantities averaged over large samples of
galaxies - significant variance for individual galaxies remains even when using
very large numbers of snapshots. We find only weak dependence of the rate of
convergence on the distribution of snapshots in time - snapshots spaced
uniformly in the expansion factor, uniformly in the logarithm of expansion
factor or uniformly in the logarithm of critical overdensity for collapse work
equally well in almost all cases. We provide input parameters to Galacticus
which allow this type of convergence study to be tuned to other simulations and
to be carried out for other galaxy properties.

that the majority of the galaxies with disks are likely to contain pseudobulges
and very few of these low-mass BHs live in classical bulges. The fundamental
plane of our sample is offset from classical bulges and ellipticals in a way
that is consistent with the scaling relations of pseudobulges. The sample has
smaller velocity dispersion at fixed luminosity in the Faber-Jackson plane,
compared with classical bulges and elliptical galaxies. The galaxies without
disks are structurally more similar to spheroidals than to classical bulges

does not perform any mobility related signaling, while MPLS is used as an
alternative tunneling technology between the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and
the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) replacing the IP-in-IP tunnels with Label
Switched Path (LSP) tunnels. It can also be integrated with other QoS

evaluate the impact of introducing MPLS technology in PMIPv6 domain based on

posterior probability distribution of the system state, given the observations,
plays a central conceptual role. The aim of this paper is to use this Bayesian
posterior probability distribution as a gold standard against which to evaluate
various commonly used data assimilation algorithms.
  A key aspect of geophysical data assimilation is the high dimensionality and
low predictability of the computational model. With this in mind, yet with the
goal of allowing an explicit and accurate computation of the posterior
distribution, we study the 2D Navier-Stokes equations in a periodic geometry.
We compute the posterior probability distribution by state-of-the-art
statistical sampling techniques. The commonly used algorithms that we evaluate
against this accurate gold standard, as quantified by comparing the relative
error in reproducing its moments, are 4DVAR and a variety of sequential
filtering approximations based on 3DVAR and on extended and ensemble Kalman
filters.
  The primary conclusions are that: (i) with appropriate parameter choices,
approximate filters can perform well in reproducing the mean of the desired
probability distribution; (ii) however they typically perform poorly when
attempting to reproduce the covariance; (iii) this poor performance is
compounded by the need to modify the covariance, in order to induce stability.
Thus, whilst filters can be a useful tool in predicting mean behavior, they
should be viewed with caution as predictors of uncertainty. These conclusions
are intrinsic to the algorithms and will not change if the model complexity is
increased, for example by employing a smaller viscosity, or by using a detailed
NWP model.

mergers create shocks within the intracluster medium (ICM). It is proposed that
within the shocks particles can be accelerated to extreme energies. In the
presence of a magnetic field these particles should then form large regions
emitting synchrotron radiation, creating so-called radio relics. An example of
a cluster with relics is CIZA J2242.8+5301. Here we present hydrodynamical
simulations of idealized binary cluster collisions with the aim of constraining
the merger scenario for this cluster. We conclude that by using the location,
size and width of double radio relics we can set constraints on the mass
ratios, impact parameters, timescales, and viewing geometries of binary cluster
merger events.

(In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots with type-I band alignment is studied. The lifetime
of confined excitons which are indirect in momentum-space is mainly influenced
by the sharpness of the heterointerface between the (In,Al)As quantum dot and
the AlAs barrier matrix. Time-resolved photoluminescence experiments and
theoretical model calculations reveal a strong dependence of the exciton
lifetime on the thickness of the interface diffusion layer. The lifetime of
excitons with a particular optical transition energy varies because this energy
is obtained for quantum dots differing in size, shape and composition. The
different exciton lifetimes, which result in photoluminescence with
non-exponential decay obeying a power-law function, can be described by a
phenomenological distribution function, which allows one to explain the
photoluminescence decay with one fitting parameter only.

from communications and cryptography to computation, metrology, and simulation

distributing high-quality entanglement between distant nodes. This is made
possible in the unavoidable presence of decoherence by entanglement
distillation. However, current versions of this protocol are prohibitively
costly in terms of resources. We introduce a new scheme for continuous-variable
entanglement distillation that requires only linear temporal and constant
physical or spatial resources, both of which are exponential improvements over
existing protocols. Our scheme uses a fixed module - an entanglement distillery
- comprising only four quantum memories of at most 50 % storage efficiency and
allowing a feasible experimental implementation. Tangible quantum advantages
are obtained by using non-ideal quantum memories outside their conventional
role of storage. By creating, storing and processing information in the same
physical space, the scheme establishes a potentially valuable technique for
designing stable, scalable protocols across different quantum technologies.

substrate, it is possible for a ratchet effect to occur where the particles
undergo a net dc motion in response to an ac forcing. Ratchet effects have been
demonstrated in a variety of systems including colloids as well as magnetic
vortices in type-II superconductors. Here we examine the case of active matter
or self-driven particles interacting with asymmetric substrates. Active matter
systems include self-motile colloidal particles undergoing catalysis, swimming
bacteria, artificial swimmers, crawling cells, and motor proteins. We show that
a ratchet effect can arise in this type of system even in the absence of ac
forcing. The directed motion occurs for certain particle-substrate interaction
rules and its magnitude depends on the amount of time the particles spend
swimming in one direction before turning and swimming in a new direction. For
strictly Brownian particles there is no ratchet effect. If the particles
reflect off the barriers or scatter from the barriers according to Snell's law
there is no ratchet effect; however, if the particles can align with the
barriers or move along the barriers, directed motion arises. We also find that
under certain motion rules, particles accumulate along the walls of the
container in agreement with experiment. We also examine pattern formation for
synchronized particle motion. We discuss possible applications of this system
for self-assembly, extracting work, and sorting as well as future directions
such as considering collective interactions and flocking models.

electrons on a two dimensional lattice that begins with the low energy
effective theory of the Fermi liquid. The approach to the Mott transition must
be characterized by the suppression of density and current fluctuations which
correspond to specific shape deformations of the Fermi surface. We explore the
nature of the Mott insulator and the corresponding Mott transition when these
shape fluctuations of the Fermi surface are suppressed without making any a
prior assumptions about other Fermi surface shape fluctuations. Building on
insights from the theory of the Mott transition of bosons, we implement this
suppression by identifying and condensing vortex degrees of freedom in the
phase of the low energy electron operator. We show that the resulting Mott
insulator is a quantum spin liquid with a spinon fermi surface coupled to a
U(1) gauge field which is usually described within a slave particle
formulation. Our approach thus provides a coarse-grained treatment of the Mott
transition and the proximate spin liquid that is nevertheless equivalent to the
standard slave particle construction. This alternate point of view provides
further insight into the novel physics of the Mott transition and the spin
liquid state that is potentially useful. We describe a generalization that
suppresses spin anti-symmetric fluctuations of the Fermi surface that leads to
a spin-gapped charge metal previously also discussed in terms of slave particle
constructions.

of selection and evolutionary effects that may account for many of the apparent
differences between cluster populations in different galaxies. One potentially
important difference between ancient GCs and young star clusters is the
presence of complex star formation / chemical enrichment histories in the GCs.

distance of ~12 kpc, and then flattens to a roughly constant value in the outer
disk. Cluster average element [X/Fe] ratios appear to be independent of Rgc,
although the picture for [O/Fe] is more more complicated by a clear trend of
[O/Fe] with [Fe/H] and sample incompleteness. Other than oxygen, no other
element [X/Fe] exhibits a clear trend with [Fe/H]; likewise, there does not
appear to be any strong correlation between abundance and cluster age. We
divided clusters into different age bins to explore temporal variations in the
radial element distributions. The radial metallicity gradient appears to have
flattened slightly as a function of time, as found by other studies. There is
also indication that the transition from the inner disk to the outer disk
occurs at different Galactocentric radii for different age bins. (Abridged.)

$\mu(L(G))=|E(G)|-|V(G)|$ for a strongly connected digraph $G$ except for

setting is thus similar to recent works on channels with action-dependent
states where the channel state may be influenced by some of the parties
involved. We derive single-letter expressions for the secret key capacity
through a type of source emulation analysis. We also derive lower bounds on the
achievable reliability and secrecy exponents, i.e., the exponential rates of
decay of the probability of decoding error and of the information leakage.
These exponents allow us to determine a set of strongly-achievable secret key
rates. For degraded eavesdroppers the maximum strongly-achievable rate equals
the secret key capacity; our exponents can also be specialized to previously
known results.
  In deriving our strong achievability results we introduce a coding scheme
that combines wiretap coding (to excite the channel) and key extraction (to
distill keys from residual randomness). The secret key capacity is naturally
seen to be a combination of both source- and channel-type randomness. Through
examples we illustrate a fundamental interplay between the portion of the
secret key rate due to each type of randomness. We also illustrate inherent
tradeoffs between the achievable reliability and secrecy exponents. Our new
scheme also naturally accommodates rate limits on the public discussion. We
show that under rate constraints we are able to achieve larger rates than those
that can be attained through a pure source emulation strategy.

four dimensional space-time. Given a cuboid container, a finite number of rigid
cuboid items, and the time length that each item should be continuous baked in
the container, the problem asks to arrange the starting time for each item
being placed into the container and to arrange the position and orientation for
each item at each instant during its continuous baking period such that the
total time length the container be utilized is as short as possible. Here all
side dimensions of the container and of the items are positive real numbers
arbitrarily given. Differs from the classical packing problems, the position
and orientation of each item in the container could be changed over time.
Therefore, according to above mathematical model, the four-dimensional
space-time can be utilized more truly and more fully. This paper then proves
that there exists an exact algorithm that could solve the problem by finite
operations, so we say this problem is weak computable. Based on the
understanding of this computability proof, it is expected to design effective
approximate algorithms in the near future. A piggyback work completed is a
strict proof on the weak computability over general and natural case of the
three-dimensional cuboid packing decision problem that all parameters are
positive real numbers.

report on the discovery of {\gamma}-ray emission in the off-pulse phase
interval at the ~ 6{\sigma} level. The flux from this emission in the energy
range E \geq 100 MeV is F_100 = (1.73\pm0.40)\times10^(-8) photons/cm^2/s and
is best fitted by a power law with a photon index of {\Gamma} = 2.54\pm0.14.
The pulsed {\gamma}-ray flux in the same energy range is F_100 =
(3.95\pm0.07)\times10^(-7) photons/cm^2/s and is best fitted by an
exponentially-cutoff power-law spectrum with a photon index of {\Gamma} = 1.41

variability neither at the 2009 May glitch nor in the long term behavior. We
model the {\gamma}-ray light curve with two high-altitude emission models, the
outer gap and slot gap, and find that the model that best fits the data depends
strongly on the assumed origin of the off-pulse emission. Both models favor a
large angle between the magnetic axis and observer line of sight, consistent
with the nondetection of radio emission being a geometrical effect. Finally we
discuss how the LAT results bear on the understanding of the cooling of this
neutron star.

A null result can be translated into a limit on the variation of a set of

models, particularly unification models, changes in alpha are always
accompanied by corresponding changes in other fundamental quantities such as
the QCD scale, Lambda_QCD. This work tracks the changes in the nucleon
g-factors induced from changes in Lambda_QCD and the light quark masses. In
principle, these coupled variations can improve the bounds on the variation of
alpha by an order of magnitude from existing atomic clock and astrophysical
measurements. Unfortunately, the calculation of the dependence of g-factors on

intuitionistic and classical logics into this system provide type-preserving
translations of the \lambda- and \lambda\mu-calculus, both for call-by-name and
call-by-value evaluation strategies. Previously known encodings of the
\lam-calculus are shown to correspond to particular cases of this logical
embedding. The realisability interpretation of types in the \pi-calculus
provides systematic soundness arguments for these translations and allows for
the definition of type-safe extensions of functional calculi.

Networks (LON), we conduct a thorough analysis of two types of instances of the
Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). This network model is a reduction of the
landscape in which the nodes correspond to the local optima, and the edges
account for the notion of adjacency between their basins of attraction. The
model was inspired by the notion of 'inherent network' of potential energy
surfaces proposed in physical-chemistry. The local optima networks extracted
from the so called uniform and real-like QAP instances, show features clearly
distinguishing these two types of instances. Apart from a clear confirmation
that the search difficulty increases with the problem dimension, the analysis
provides new confirming evidence explaining why the real-like instances are
easier to solve exactly using heuristic search, while the uniform instances are
easier to solve approximately. Although the local optima network model is still
under development, we argue that it provides a novel view of combinatorial
landscapes, opening up the possibilities for new analytical tools and
understanding of problem difficulty in combinatorial optimization.

details of the underlying landscape and compresses the landscape information
into a weighted, oriented graph which we call the local optima network. The
vertices of this graph are the local optima of the given fitness landscape,
while the arcs are transition probabilities between local optima basins. Here
we extend this formalism to neutral fitness landscapes, which are common in
difficult combinatorial search spaces. By using two known neutral variants of
the NK family (i.e. NKp and NKq) in which the amount of neutrality can be tuned
by a parameter, we show that our new definitions of the optima networks and the
associated basins are consistent with the previous definitions for the
non-neutral case. Moreover, our empirical study and statistical analysis show
that the features of neutral landscapes interpolate smoothly between landscapes
with maximum neutrality and non-neutral ones. We found some unknown structural
differences between the two studied families of neutral landscapes. But
overall, the network features studied confirmed that neutrality, in landscapes
with percolating neutral networks, may enhance heuristic search. Our current
methodology requires the exhaustive enumeration of the underlying search space.
Therefore, sampling techniques should be developed before this analysis can
have practical implications. We argue, however, that the proposed model offers
a new perspective into the problem difficulty of combinatorial optimization
problems and may inspire the design of more effective search heuristics.

that are responsible for generating magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals
measured on the surface of the head is a challenging problem in functional
neuroimaging. The number of potential sources within the brain exceeds by an
order of magnitude the number of recording sites. As a consequence, the
estimates for the magnitude and location of the neural sources will be
ill-conditioned because of the underdetermined nature of the problem. One
well-known technique designed to address this imbalance is the minimum norm
estimator (MNE). This approach imposes an $L^2$ regularization constraint that
serves to stabilize and condition the source parameter estimates. However,
these classes of regularizer are static in time and do not consider the
temporal constraints inherent to the biophysics of the MEG experiment. In this
paper we propose a dynamic state-space model that accounts for both spatial and
temporal correlations within and across candidate intracortical sources. In our
model, the observation model is derived from the steady-state solution to
Maxwell's equations while the latent model representing neural dynamics is
given by a random walk process.

that the permanent is lower bounded by the Bethe permanent, and we comment on
potential upper bounds on the permanent based on the Bethe permanent. We also
present a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe permanent in terms of
permanents of so-called lifted versions of the matrix under consideration.

unitarity, and is unifying of other approaches. As an example we construct a
symmetric discrete-time quantum walk on the semi-infinite binary tree. The
generating function of the amplitude at the root is computed in closed-form, as
a function of time and the initial level n in the tree, and we find the
asymptotic and a full numerical solution for the amplitude. It exhibits a sharp
interference peak and a power law tail, as opposed to the exponentially
decaying tail of a broadly peaked distribution of the classical symmetric
random walk on a binary tree. The probability peak is orders of magnitude
larger than it is for the classical walk (already at small n). The quantum walk
shows a polynomial algorithmic speedup in n over the classical walk, which we

Malay is strongly related especially for what concerns navigation terms. Since
the Maanyan Dayaks live along the Barito river in Kalimantan (Borneo) and they

colonization consisted in a single founding event.

address the problem of optimal resetting, that is, minimising the mean time to
absorption for a given target distribution. For an exponentially decaying
target distribution centred at the origin we show that a transition in the
optimal resetting distribution occurs as the target distribution narrows.

present a Bayesian approach for inferring neural circuitry given this type of

blockwise-Gibbs algorithm for sampling from the joint activity of all observed

simulations of randomly connected neuronal networks with biophysically
realistic parameters and find that the proposed methods can accurately infer
the connectivity in these networks given reasonable experimental and

significantly by incorporating prior knowledge about the sparseness of

spectrum can be constrained using the neutral hydrogen density in the
intergalactic medium as a tracer of the matter density. One of the goals of the
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS-III) is to derive the Hubble expansion rate and the angular scale from
the BAO signal in the IGM. To this aim, the Lyman-alpha forest of 10^5 quasars
will be observed in the redshift range 2.2<z<3.5 and over 10,000 deg^2. We
simulated the BOSS QSO survey to estimate the statistical accuracy on the BAO
scale determination provided by such a large scale survey. In particular, we
discuss the effect of the poorly constrained estimate of the unabsorbed
intrinsic quasar spectrum. The volume of current N-body simulations being too
small for such studies, we resorted to Gaussian random field (GRF) simulations.
We validated the use of GRFs by comparing the output of GRF simulations with
that of the Horizon N-body simulation with the same initial conditions.
Realistic mock samples of QSO Lyman-\alpha forest were generated; their power
spectrum was computed and fitted to obtain the BAO scale. The rms of the
results for 100 different simulations provides an estimate of the statistical
error expected from the BOSS survey. We confirm the results from Fisher matrix
estimate. In the absence of error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum, the BOSS
quasar survey should measure the BAO scale with an error of the order of 2.3%,
or the transverse and radial BAO scales separately with errors of the order of
6.8% and 3.9%, respectively. The significance of the BAO detection is assessed
by an average \Delta\chi^2=17 but for individual realizations \Delta\chi^2
ranges from 2 t o 35. The error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum increases the
error on the BAO scale by 10 to 20% and results in a sub percent bias.

for the two starbursts is best explained by hadronic interactions, and thus
providing a first, unique opportunity to study the role of cosmic rays in

of galaxies is reviewed by discussing the entire non-thermal frequency range
from radio emission to TeV energies. In particular, the interpretation of radio
emission arising from electron synchrotron radiation is predicted to be
correlated to TeV emission coming from interactions of accelerated hadrons.
This is observed for the few objects known at TeV energies, but the correlation
needs to be established with significantly higher statistics. An outlook of the

astrophysical fields. In particular, the possibility of finding them at the
centers of globular clusters has recently drawn attention. IMBHs became
detectable since the quality of observational data sets, particularly those
obtained with HST and with high resolution ground based spectrographs, advanced
to the point where it is possible to measure velocity dispersions at a spatial
resolution comparable to the size of the gravitational sphere of influence for
plausible IMBH masses. We present results from ground based VLT/FLAMES
spectroscopy in combination with HST data for the globular cluster NGC 6388.
The aim of this work is to probe whether this massive cluster hosts an
intermediate-mass black hole at its center and to compare the results with the
expected value predicted by the $M_{\bullet} - \sigma$ scaling relation. The
spectroscopic data, containing integral field unit measurements, provide
kinematic signatures in the center of the cluster while the photometric data
give information of the stellar density. Together, these data sets are compared
to dynamical models and present evidence of an additional compact dark mass at
the center: a black hole. Using analytical Jeans models in combination with
various Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the errors, we derive (with 68%
confidence limits) a best fit black-hole mass of $ (17 \pm 9) \times 10^3

pairs of measurements and covers a wide range of time lags between 3 days and
6.9 years in the quasar rest frame. A broken power-law fit to this data shows
the presence of two slopes alpha_1=0.33 and alpha_2=0.79 with the break at ~42
days. The structure function compiled using only flux increases is slightly
lower than that for variations of the opposite sign, revealing a slight
asymmetry between the leading and trailing edge of a typical flare. The reality
of these features is confirmed with monte-carlo simulations. We give simple
interpretation of the results in the frames of existing theoretical models.

aim of density functional theory. The traditional approach to defining a local
hardness index, by the derivative of the chemical potential with respect to the
electron density subject to the constraint of a fixed external potential, has
raised several questions, and its chemical applicability has proved to be
limited. Here, we point out that the only actual possibility to obtain a local
hardness measure in the traditional approach emerges if the external potential
constraint is dropped; consequently, utilizing the ambiguity of a restricted
chemical potential derivative is not an option to gain alternative definitions
of local hardness. At the same time, however, the arising local hardness
concept turns out to be fatally undermined by its inherent connection with the
asymptotic value of the second derivative of the universal density functional.
The only other local hardness concept one may deduce from the traditional
definition is the one that gives a constant value, the global hardness itself,
throughout an electron system in its ground state. Consequently, the
traditional approach is in principle incapable of delivering a local hardness
indicator. The parallel case of defining a local version of the chemical
potential itself is also outlined, arriving at a similar conclusion. Namely,
the only local chemical potential concept that can be gained from a definition
dE[n]/dn(r)|v is the one that gives a constant, mu itself, for electron systems
in their ground state.

handling different time scales separately.
  Two major assets of this method are its simplicity, with few tuneable

driven by purely `local' events and one incorporating large-scale extinction
recolonisation events. We choose the frequency of these events in such a way
that, under a suitable rescaling of space and time, the ancestry of a single
individual in the population converges to a symmetric stable process of index
alpha in (1,2] (with alpha=2 corresponding to Brownian motion). We consider the
behaviour of the process of allele frequencies under the same space and time
rescaling. For alpha=2 and d>1 it converges to a deterministic limit. In all
other cases the limit is random and we identify it as the indicator function of
a random set. In particular, there is no local coexistence of types in the

symmetric stable processes, which is of interest in its own right. The complex

discounting for which there exists a theorem characterizing all the equilibrium
utilities (equilibrium utility region). As in its general formulation, this
theorem relies on global channel state information (CSI), it is shown that some

this setting. After having shown through a counter-example that naive flatness
cannot be the right notion because it is not stable under base change, we
define flatness by {\em requiring} invariance under base change, and we study a
first important class of flat morphisms, that of quasi-smooth ones. We then
show the existence of local {\em d\'evissages} (in the spirit of Raynaud and
Gruson) for coherent sheaves, which we use, together with a study of the local
rings of ""generic fibers"" of morphisms, to prove that a {\em boundaryless},
naively flat morphism is flat. After that we prove that the image of a compact
analytic space by a flat morphism can be covered by a compact, relatively
Cohen-Macaulay and zero-dimensional multisection, and the image of the latter
is shown to be a compact analytic domain of the target; we thus recover the
result by Raynaud telling that the image of a compact analytic space under a
flat morphism is a compact analytic domain of the target. In the last part of
this work we study some validity loci. We first prove that the flatness locus
of a given morphism of analytic spaces is a Zariski-open subset of the source.
We then look at the {\em fiberwise} validity loci of the usual commutative
algebra properties. We prove that the results we could expect actually hold:
the fiberwise validity locus of such a property is Zariski-constructible, and
Zariski-open under suitable extra assumptions (flatness, and also sometimes
equidimentionality).

spin correlations are characterized by two universal scaling functions in the
absence of an external field: one of them is related to charge correlations,
while the other one describes cross-spin correlations. We characterize these
functions using a combination of perturbative and non-perturbative methods. We
find that at low temperatures spin cross-correlations are suppressed at
frequencies below the Kondo scale, $T_K$, and a dynamical spin accumulation
resonance is found at the Kondo energy, $\omega \sim T_K$. At higher
temperatures, $T>T_K$, surprising low-frequency anomalies related to overall

cilium leads to curly, often symmetric and somewhat counterintuitive patterns.
But when looking at a densely ciliated surface, the optimal patterns become
remarkably similar to what is observed in microorganisms like Paramecium. The
optimal beating pattern then consists of a fast effective stroke and a slow
sweeping recovery stroke. Metachronal coordination is essential for efficient
pumping and the highest efficiency is achieved with antiplectic waves.
Efficiency also increases with an increasing density of cilia up to the point
where crowding becomes a problem. We finally relate the pumping efficiency of
cilia to the swimming efficiency of a spherical microorganism and show that the
experimentally estimated efficiency of Paramecium is surprisingly close to the
theoretically possible optimum.

their neutron to proton ratio and their radius at a given baryonic density, are
obtained from the energy minimization at beta equilibrium. To obtain the
binding energy of baryonic matter we perform Skyrme-HFB calculations with
zero-range density-dependent pairing forces of various intensities. We find
that the Wigner-Seitz cells have much smaller numbers of protons compared to
previous calculations. For the dense cells the binding energy of the
configurations with small proton numbers do not converge to a well-defined
minimum value which precludes the determination of their structure. We show
that for these cells there is a significant underestimation of the binding

rapidly growing interest in multiband models with more than two bands. In this
work we specifically focus on the properties of three-band Ginzburg-Landau
models which do not have direct counterparts in more studied two-band models.
First we derive normal modes and characteristic length scales in the
conventional U(1) three-band Ginzburg-Landau model as well as in its time
reversal symmetry broken counterpart with $U(1)\times Z_2$ symmetry. We show
that in the latter case, the normal modes are mixed phase/density collective
excitations. A possibility of the appearance of a massless phase-difference
mode associated with fluctuations of the phase difference is also discussed.
Next we show that gradients of densities and phase differences can be
inextricably intertwined in vortex excitations in three-band models. This can
lead to very long-range attractive intervortex interactions and appearance of
type-1.5 regimes even when the intercomponent Josephson coupling is large. In
some cases it also results in the formation of a domain-like structures in the
form of a ring of suppressed density around a vortex across which one of the
phases shifts by $\pi$. We also show that field-induced vortices can lead to a
change of broken symmetry from U(1) to $U(1)\times Z_2$ in the system. In the
type-1.5 regime, it results in a semi-Meissner state where the system has a
macroscopic phase separation in domains with broken U(1) and $U(1)\times Z_2$
symmetries.

deconvolution of radio images, performs well only if the raw radio image (dirty
image) is, to good approximation, a simple convolution between the instrumental
point-spread function (dirty beam) and the true distribution of emission across
the sky. An important case in which this approximation breaks down is during
frequency synthesis if the observing bandwidth is wide enough for variations in
the spectrum of the sky to become significant. The convolution assumption also
breaks down, in any situation but snapshot observations, if sources in the
field vary significantly in flux density over the duration of the observation.
Such time-variation can even be instrumental in nature, for example due to
jitter or rotation of the primary beam pattern on the sky during an
observation. An algorithm already exists for dealing with the spectral
variation encountered in wide-band frequency synthesis interferometry. This
algorithm is an extension of CLEAN in which, at each iteration, a set of N
`dirty beams' are fitted and subtracted in parallel, instead of just a single
dirty beam as in standard CLEAN. In the wide-band algorithm the beams are
obtained by expanding a nominal source spectrum in a Taylor series, each term
of the series generating one of the beams. In the present paper this algorithm
is extended to images which contain sources which vary over both frequency and
time. Different expansion schemes (or bases) on the time and frequency axes are
compared, and issues such as Gibbs ringing and non-orthogonality are discussed.
It is shown that practical considerations make it often desirable to
orthogonalize the set of beams before commencing the cleaning. This is easily
accomplished via a Gram-Schmidt technique.

haloes from N-body simulations. The algorithm relies upon the fact that
dynamically distinct substructures in a halo will have a {\em local} velocity
distribution that differs significantly from the mean, i.e. smooth background
halo. We characterize the large-scale mean field using a coarsely grained
cell-based approach, while a kernel smoothing process is used to determined the
local velocity distribution. Comparing the ratio of these two estimates allows
us to identify particles which are strongly cluster in velocity space relative
to the background and thus resident in substructure. From this population of
outliers, groups are identified using a Friends-of-Friends-like approach. False
positives are rejected using Poisson noise arguments. This approach does not
require a search of the full phase-space structure of a halo, a non-trivial
task, and is thus computationally advantageous. We apply our algorithm to
several test cases and show that it identifies not only subhaloes, bound
overdensities in phase-space, but can recover tidal streams with a high purity.
Our method can even find streams which do not appear significantly overdense in
either physical or phase-space.

match the observed source counts at different IR wavelengths. We introduce a
new algorithm for reproducing source counts based on direct integration of
probability distributions rather than Monte-Carlo sampling. We construct a
simple model for the evolution of the luminosity function and the colour
distribution of IR galaxies which utilizes a minimum number of free parameters.
Moreover we analyze how each of these parameters is constrained by
observational data. The model is based on pure luminosity evolution and adopts
the Dale & Helou SED templates. We find that the 850um source counts and their
redshift distribution depend strongly on the shape of the luminosity evolution
function, but only weakly on the details of the SEDs. We derive the best-fit
evolutionary model using the 850um counts and redshift distribution as
constraints. Moreover our best-fit shows a flattening of the faint end of the
luminosity function towards high redshifts and requires a colour evolution
which implies the typical dust temperatures of objects with the same
luminosities to decrease with redshift. We compare our best-fit model to
observed source counts at shorter and longer wavelengths which indicates our
model reproduces the 70um and 1100um source counts remarkably well, but
under-produces the counts at intermediate wavelengths. Analysis reveals that
the discrepancy arises at low redshifts, indicating that revision of the
adopted SED library towards lower dust temperatures (at a fixed infrared
luminosity) is required. This modification is equivalent to a population of
cold galaxies existing at low redshifts, as also indicated by recent Herschel
results, which are underrepresented in IRAS sample. We show that the modified
model successfully reproduces the source counts in a wide range of IR and submm

Galerkin (DPG) method, accounting for all the approximations made in its

Earlier works showed that there is a ""trial-to-test"" operator $T$, which when
applied to the trial space, defines a test space that guarantees stability. In
DPG formulations, this operator $T$ is local: it can be applied
element-by-element. However, an infinite dimensional problem on each mesh
element needed to be solved to apply $T$. In practical computations, $T$ is
approximated using polynomials of some degree $r > p$ on each mesh element. We
show that this approximation maintains optimal convergence rates, provided that
$r\ge p+N$, where $N$ is the space dimension (two or more), for the Laplace
equation. We also prove a similar result for the DPG method for linear
elasticity. Remarks on the conditioning of the stiffness matrix in DPG methods

$\Omega_{D}$, the D. C. angular rotation velocity, $\omega_{TO}$, the torsional
oscillator oscillating frequency. We estimate the AC critical velocity
$\Omega_A^{crit}$ as that required to generate a kink wave of wavevector
$2\pi/L_d$ where $L_d$ is the distance between nodes of the dislocation
network. We generalize this to include a steady rotation and find a D. C.
critical velocity $\Omega_D^{crit} \propto (\Omega_{A}^{crit})^{1/2}$.
Estimates for both the steady and the oscillating critical velocities are in
order of magnitude agreement with experimental results. We have also examined
an alternative mechanism of kink tunnelling through a node in the dislocation
networm and find that there is also a dependence on the torsional oscillator
frequency: $\Omega_D^{crit}=[\Omega_A^{crit} \omega_{TO}2\pi]^{1/2}. $ The DC
critical velocity $\Omega_D^{crit}$ is ten times higher than the experimental
value.

density plots are utilised to study the effect of key parameters, such as gate
operation times, and random variables, such as the initial fields required to
start the iterative algorithm. Core characteristics of the optimal fields are
statistically analysed. Substantial differences between Markovian and
non-Markovian environments in terms of the possibilities for control and the
control mechanisms are uncovered. In particular, in the Markovian case it is
found that the optimal fields obtained without considering the environment
cannot be improved substantially by taking the environment into account and the
fidelities attained are determined mostly by the gate operation time as well as
the overall strength of the environmental effects. Computation time is saved if
the fields are pre-optimised neglecting decoherence. In the non-Markovian case,
on the other hand, substantial improvements in the fidelities are observed when
the details of the system-bath coupling are taken into account. In that case,
field leakage is shown to be a significant issue which can make high gate
fidelities impossible to obtain unless both the system and noise qubits are
