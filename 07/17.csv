have been calculated based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus
on-site Coulomb interaction (GGA+U) scheme. It is found that the intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{xy}^H$) obtained from the GGA+U
calculations with $U = 1.9$ eV and $J=1.2$ eV, is in nearly perfect agreement
with that measured recently at low temperatures while, in contrast, the
$\sigma_{xy}^H$ from the GGA calculations is about 100% larger than the
measured one. This indicates that, as for the other spin-orbit interaction
(SOI)-induced phenomena in 3$d$ itinerant magnets such as the orbital magnetic
magnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the on-site electron-electron
correlation, though moderate only, should be taken into account properly in
order to get the correct anomalous Hall conductivity. The intrinsic
$\sigma_{xy}^H$ and the number of valence electrons ($N_e$) have also been
calculated as a function of the Fermi energy ($E_F$). A sign change is
predicted at $E_F = -0.38$ eV ($N_e = 9.57$), and this explain qualitatively
why the theoretical and experimental $\sigma_{xy}^H$ values for Fe and Co are
positive. It is also predicted that fcc Ni$_{(1-x)}$Co(Fe,Cu)$_x$ alloys with
$x$ being small, would also have the negative $\sigma_{xy}^H$ with the
magnitude being in the range of $500\sim 1400$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. The most
pronounced effect of including the on-site Coulomb interaction is that all the
$d$-dominant bands are lowered in energy relative to the $E_F$ by about 0.3 eV,
and consequently, the small minority spin X$_2$ hole pocket disappears. The
presence of the small X$_2$ hole pocket in the GGA calculations is attributed
to be responsible for the large discrepancy in the $\sigma_{xy}^H$ between
theory and experiment.

limits for systems of indistinguable particles, undergoing collision processes.
The prime examples we will consider are the many-particle jump processes of Kac
and McKean \cite{Kac1956,McKean1967} giving rise to the Boltzmann equation. We
solve the conjecture raised by Kac \cite{Kac1956}, motivating his program, on
the rigorous connection between the long-time behavior of a collisional
many-particle system and the one of its mean-field limit, for bounded as well
as unbounded collision rates. Motivated by the inspirative paper by Gr\""unbaum
\cite{Grunbaum}, we develop an abstract method that reduces the question of
propagation of chaos to that of proving a purely functional estimate on
generator operators ({\em consistency estimates}), along with differentiability
estimates on the flow of the nonlinear limit equation ({\em stability
estimates}). This allows us to exploit dissipativity at the level of the
mean-field limit equation rather than the level of the particle system (as
proposed by Kac). Using this method we show: (1) Quantitative estimates, that
are uniform in time, on the chaoticity of a family of states. (2) Propagation
of {\it entropic chaoticity}, as defined in \cite{CCLLV}. (3) Estimates on the
time of relaxation to equilibrium, that are \emph{independent of the number of
particles in the system}. Our results cover the two main Boltzmann physical
collision processes with unbounded collision rates: hard spheres and
\emph{true} Maxwell molecules interactions. The proof of the \emph{stability
estimates} for these models requires significant analytic efforts and new
estimates.

(LDPC) convolutional codes (or spatially-coupled codes) appear to approach
capacity universally across the class of binary memoryless channels. This is
facilitated by the ""threshold saturation"" effect whereby the belief-propagation
(BP) threshold of the spatially-coupled ensemble is boosted to the maximum
a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying constituent ensemble.
  In this paper, we consider the universality of spatially-coupled codes over
intersymbol-interference (ISI) channels under joint iterative decoding. More
specifically, we empirically show that threshold saturation also occurs for the
considered problem. This can be observed by first identifying the EXIT curve
for erasure noise and the GEXIT curve for general noise that naturally obey the
general area theorem. From these curves, the corresponding MAP and the BP
thresholds are then numerically obtained. With the fact that regular LDPC codes
can achieve the symmetric information rate (SIR) under MAP decoding,
spatially-coupled codes with joint iterative decoding can universally approach
the SIR of ISI channels. For the dicode erasure channel, Kudekar and Kasai
recently reported very similar results based on EXIT-like curves.

Irradiation with multiple pulses leads to ripple formation of nanometre size

their inner disk. Disks with radial gaps in NGC 1333 show more-nearly pristine
silicate dust than their radially continuous counterparts. We compare

successfully communicating agents is basically negligible and the model behaves
similarly to the naming game on a complete graph. In particular, it quickly
reaches a single-language state, albeit some details of the dynamics are
different from the complete-graph version. In some other cases, the preference

low-cost, large area electronic devices such as flat panel displays and
inexpensive solar panels. Small molecules in the series Anthracene, Tetracene,
Pentacene, are model molecules for organic semiconductor thin films to be used
as the active layers in such devices. This has motivated a number of studies of
polyacene thin film growth and structure. Although the majority of these
studies rely on vapor-deposited films, solvent-based deposition of films with
improved properties onto non-crystalline substrates is desired for industrial
production of devices. Improved ordering in thin films will have a large impact
on their electronic properties, since grain boundaries and other defects are
detrimental to carrier mobilities and lifetimes. Thus, a long-standing
challenge in this field is to prepare largearea single crystal films on
arbitrary substrates. Here we demonstrate a solvent-based method to deposit
thin films of organic semiconductors, which is very general. Anthracene thin
films with single-crystal domain sizes exceeding 1x1 cm2 can be prepared on
various substrates by the technique. Films of
6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene are also demonstrated to have grain
sizes larger than 2x2 mm2. In contrast, films produced by conventional means
such as vapor deposition or spin coating are polycrystalline with micron-scale
grain sizes. The general propensity of these small molecules towards
crystalline order in an optimized solvent deposition process shows that there
is great potential for thin films with improved properties. Films prepared by
these methods will also be useful in exploring the limits of performance in
organic thin film devices.

states at atomic resolution, and thereby to better understand the relation
between protein interactions and biological functions, we conducted exhaustive
all-against-all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for
ligands including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids, and identified
recurring elementary motifs. By integrating the elementary motifs associated
with each subunit, we defined composite motifs which represent
context-dependent combinations of elementary motifs. It is demonstrated that
function similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity
compared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites.
By integrating the composite motifs associated with each protein function, we
define meta-composite motifs each of which is regarded as a time-independent
diagrammatic representation of a biological process. It is shown that
meta-composite motifs provide richer annotations of biological processes than
sequence clusters. The present results serve as a basis for bridging atomic

and, by means of merging, transform them into elliptical galaxies. We aim to
investigate how they affect the evolution of galactic magnetic fields. We
selected 16 systems of interacting galaxies and compared their radio emission
and estimated magnetic field strengths with their star-forming activity,
far-infrared emission, and the stage of tidal interaction. We find a general
evolution of magnetic fields: for weak interactions the strength of magnetic
field is almost constant (10-15muG) as interaction advances, then it increases
up to 2x, peaks at the nuclear coalescence (25muG), and decreases again, down
to 5-6muG, for the post-merger remnants. The magnetic field strength for whole
galaxies is weakly affected by the star formation rate (SFR), while the
dependence is higher for galactic centres. We show that the morphological
distortions visible in the radio total and polarized emission do not depend
statistically on the global or local SFRs, while they do increase with the
advance of interaction. The constructed radio-far-infrared relations for
interacting and non-interacting galaxies display a similar balance between the
generation of cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and the production of the thermal
energy and dust radiation. The process of strong gravitational interactions can
efficiently magnetize the merger's surroundings, having a similar magnetizing
effect on intergalactic medium as supernova explosions or galactic winds. If
interacting galaxies generate some ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), the
disk or magnetized outflows can deflect them (up to 23 degrees), and make an
association of the observed UHECRs with the sites of their origin very
uncertain.

the weakly-damped NLS $$
i\psi_t(t,\X)+\Delta\psi+|\psi|^{p-1}\psi+i\delta|\psi|^{q-1}\psi=0,\qquad0<\delta
\ll 1, $$ is highly asymmetric with respect to the singularity time, and the
post-collapse defocusing velocity of the singular core goes to infinity as the
damping coefficient $\delta$ goes to zero. In the special case of the
minimal-power blowup solutions of the critical NLS, the continuation is a
minimal-power solution with a higher (but finite) defocusing velocity, whose
magnitude increases monotonically with the nonlinear damping exponent $q$.

functional calculations are performed to systematically study a series of
finite and infinite hydrogenated cluster-assembled silicon nanotubes (SiNTs).
It is found that stable one-dimensional SiNTs with formula
$Si_{m(3k+1)}H_{2m(k+1)}$ can be constructed by proper assembly of hydrogenated
fullerene-like silicon clusters $Si_{4m}H_{4m}$. The stability is first
demonstrated by the large cohesive energies and HOMO-LUMO gaps. Among all such
silicon nanotubes, the ones built from $Si_{20}H_{20}$($m=5$) and
$Si_{24}H_{24}$($m=6$) are the most stable due to the silicon bond angles that
are most close to the bulk $sp^{3}$ type in these structures. Thermostability
analysis further verifies that such tubes may well exist at room temperature.
Finally, both finite nanotubes and infinite nanotubes show a large energy gap.
A direct-indirect-direct band gap transition has been revealed with the
increase of the tube radius. The existence of direct band gap may make them
potential building blocks for electronic and optoelectronic devices.

applied in the simplest case k = 1/2 to WIG 20 open and close daily data to

precess along the demagnetizing field induced by the resulting magnetic moment.
Normally this precession damps out by virtue of the spin relaxation which is
present in paramagnetic materials. We propose a new mechanism to excite a
steady-state form of this dynamics by injecting a constant spin current into
this paramagnetic disc. We show that the rotating magnetic field generated by
the eddy currents provide a torque which makes this possible. Unlike the
ferromagnetic equivalent, the spin-torque-oscillator, the oscillation frequency
is fixed and determined by the dimensions and intrinsic parameters of the
paramagnet. The system possesses an intrinsic threshold for spin injection
which needs to be overcome before steady-state precession is possible. The
additional application of a magnetic field lowers this threshold. We discuss
the feasibility of this effect in modern materials. Transient analysis using
pump-probe techniques should give insight in the physical processes which
accompany this effect.

interest rate models in the case of a Brownian market information filtration
$(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq0}$. Let $X$ be a square-integrable
$\mathcal{F}_\infty$-measurable random variable, and assume the non-degeneracy
condition that for all $t<\infty$ the random variable $X$ is not
$\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Let ${\sigma_t}$ denote the integrand appearing in
the representation of $X$ as a stochastic integral, write $\pi_t$ for the
conditional variance of $X$ at time $t$, and set $r_t = \sigma^2_t / \pi_t$.
Then $\pi_t$ is a potential, and as such can act as a model for a pricing
kernel (or state price density), where $r_t$ is the associated interest rate.
Under the stated assumptions, we prove the following: (a) that the money market
account process defined by $B_t = \exp (\int_0^t r_s \,ds)$ is finite almost
surely at all finite times; and (b) that the product of the money-market
account and the pricing kernel is a local martingale, and is a martingale
provided a certain integrability condition is satisfied. The fact that a
martingale is thus obtained shows that from any non-degenerate element of
Wiener space satisfying the integrability condition we can construct an
associated interest-rate model. The model thereby constructed is valid over an
infinite time horizon, with strictly positive interest, and satisfies the
relevant intertemporal relations associated with the absence of arbitrage. The
results thus stated pave the way for the use of Wiener chaos methods in
interest rate modelling, since any such square-integrable Wiener functional
admits a chaos expansion, the individual terms of which can be regarded as
parametric degrees of freedom in the associated interest rate model to be fixed
by calibration to appropriately liquid sectors of the interest rate derivatives

have incomplete information about external macroscopic parameters, like
magnetic field controlling the intrinsic energy scales of the working medium.
We explicitly derive the prior probability distribution for these unknown
parameters, $a_i, (i=1,2)$. Based on a few simple assumptions, the prior is
found to be of the form $\Pi(a_i) \propto 1/a_i$. By calculating the expected
values of various physical quantities related to this engine, we find that the
expected behavior of the quantum model exhibits thermodynamic-like features.
This leads us to a surprising proposal that incomplete information quantified
as appropriate prior distribution can lead us to expect classical thermodynamic
behavior in quantum models.

in four space-time dimensions involving gauge groups with abelian and/or
non-abelian electric and magnetic charges. The charges are encoded in the gauge
group embedding tensor. The scalar potential induced by the gauge interactions
is quadratic in this tensor, and, when the embedding tensor is treated as a
spurionic quantity, it is formally covariant with respect to electric/magnetic
duality. This work establishes a general framework for studying any deformation
induced by gauge interactions of matter-coupled N=2 supergravity theories. As
an application, full and residual supersymmetry realizations in maximally
symmetric space-times are reviewed. Furthermore, a general classification is
presented of supersymmetric solutions in $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times S^2$
space-times. As it turns out, these solutions allow either eight or four
supersymmetries. With four supersymmetries, the spinorial parameters are
Killing spinors of $\mathrm{AdS}_2$ that are constant on $S^2$, so that they
carry no spin, while the bosonic background is rotationally invariant.

It is found that with certain degree of interaction asymmetry, the heat
conductivity measured in nonequilibrium stationary states converges in the
thermodynamical limit, in clear contrast to the well accepted viewpoint that
Fourier's law is generally violated in low dimensional momentum conserving
systems. It suggests in nonequilibrium stationary states the mass gradient
resulted from the asymmetric interactions may provide an additional phonon
scattering mechanism other than that due to the nonlinear interactions.

using a minimum bias trigger, allowing jets at very low transverse momentum to
be observed and their characteristics in the transition to high-momentum fully
perturbative jets to be studied. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt
algorithm applied to charged particles with two radius parameter choices, 0.4
and 0.6. An inclusive charged jet transverse momentum cross section measurement
from 4 GeV to 100 GeV is shown for four ranges in rapidity extending to 1.9 and
corrected to charged particle-level truth jets. The transverse momenta and
longitudinal momentum fractions of charged particles within jets are measured,
along with the charged particle multiplicity and the particle density as a
function of radial distance from the jet axis. Comparison of the data with the
theoretical models implemented in existing tunings of Monte Carlo event
generators indicates reasonable overall agreement between data and Monte Carlo.
These comparisons are sensitive to Monte Carlo parton showering, hadronization,
and soft physics models.
