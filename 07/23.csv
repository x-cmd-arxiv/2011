tetrads lead (in standard conditions) to equivalent Dirac equations. However,
the Hamiltonian operator is got from rewriting the Dirac equation in a form
adapted to a particular reference frame, or class of coordinate systems. That
rewriting does not commute with changing the tetrad field $(u_\alpha)$. The
data of a reference frame F fixes a four-velocity field $v$, and also fixes a
rotation-rate field $\Mat{\Omega}$. It is natural to impose that $u_0=v$. We
show that then the spatial triad $(u_p)$ can only be rotating w.r.t. F, and
that the title problem is solved if one imposes that the corresponding rotation
rate $\Mat{\Xi}$ be equal to $\Mat{\Omega}$ - or also, if one imposes that

dust in the treatment of the ISM. This major accomplishment has been spurred by
the growing amounts of data on the highly obscured high-z Universe and the
intriguing local properties of the Solar Neighbourhood (SoNE). We present here
a new model able to simulate the formation and evolution of dust in the ISM.
The model follows the evolution of 16 elemental species, with particular
attention to those that are simultaneously present in form of gas and dust,
e.g. C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe. In this study we focus on the SoNe and the
MW Disk as a whole which are considered as laboratories to test the physical
ingredients governing the dust evolution. Infall of primordial gas, birth and
death of stars, radial flows of matter between contiguous shells, presence of a
central bar, star-dust emission by SNae and AGB stars, dust destruction and
accretion are taken into account. The model reproduces the local depletion of
the elements in the gas, and simultaneously satisfies other constraints
obtained from the observations. The evolution of the element abundances in the
gas and dust has been well reproduced for plausible choices of the parameters.
The Mg/Si ratio, in particular, drives the formation of silicates. We show that
for most of the evolution of the MW, the main process for dust enrichment is
the accretion in the cold regions of the ISM. SNae dominate in the early phases
of the evolution. We have examined the main factors controlling the temporal
window in which SNae govern the dust budget both in low and high star forming
environments. The role played by AGB stars is discussed. We find that IMFs with
regular slope in the range of massive stars better reproduce the observed
depletions. The results obtained for the SoNe lead us to safely extend the
model.

required to decipher the high-z universe. In a series of three papers we have
tackled the problem and set a modern chemical evolution model. In the first
paper (Piovan et al., 2011a) we revised the condensation coefficients for the
elements that typically are present in the dust. In the second paper (Piovan et
al., 2011b) we have implemented the dust into the Padova chemical model and
tested it against the observational data for the Solar Neighbourhood. In this
paper we extend it to the whole Disk of the Milky Way (MW). The Disk is used as
a laboratory to analyze the spatial and temporal behaviour of (i) several dust
grain families with the aid of which we can describe the ISM, (ii) the
abundances in the gas, dust, and total ISM of the elements present in the dust
and (iii) the depletion of the same elements. The temporal evolution of the
dust and gas across the Disk is calculated under the effect of radial flows and
a central Bar. The gradients of the abundances of C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe
in gas and dust across the Disk are derived as a function of time. The
theoretical gradients nicely reproduce those derived from Cepheids, OB stars,
Red Giants and HII regions. This provides the backbone for the companion
processes of dust formation and evolution across the Disk. We examine in detail
the contributions to dust by AGB stars, SNae and grain accretion in the ISM at
different galacto-centric distances. Furthermore, we examine the variation of
the ratio silicates/carbonaceous grains with time and position in the Disk.
Finally, some hints about the depletion of the elements in regions of high and
low SFR (inner and outer Disk) are presented. The results obtained make it
possible to extend the model to other astrophysical situations or different
theoretical models like the chemo-dynamical N-Body simulations.

clouds. The problem is that turbulent velocities are convolved with the density
of an observed region. To correct for this convolution, we investigate the
relation between the turbulence spectrum of model clouds, and the statistics of
their synthetic observations obtained from Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
We apply PCA to spectral maps generated from simulated density and velocity
fields, obtained from hydrodynamic simulations of supersonic turbulence, and
from fractional Brownian motion fields with varying velocity, density spectra,
and density dispersion. We examine the dependence of the slope of the PCA
structure function, alpha_PCA, on intermittency, on the turbulence velocity
(beta_v) and density (beta_n) spectral indexes, and on density dispersion. We
find that PCA is insensitive to beta_n and to the log-density dispersion
sigma_s, provided sigma_s < 2. For sigma_s>2, alpha_PCA increases with sigma_s
due to the intermittent sampling of the velocity field by the density field.
The PCA calibration also depends on intermittency. We derive a PCA calibration
based on fBms with sigma_s<2 and apply it to 367 CO spectral maps of molecular
clouds in the Galactic Ring Survey. The average slope of the PCA structure
function, <alpha_PCA>=0.62\pm0.2, is consistent with the hydrodynamic
simulations and leads to a turbulence velocity exponent <beta_v>=2.06\pm0.6 for
a non-intermittent, low density dispersion flow. Accounting for intermittency
and density dispersion, the coincidence between the PCA slope of the GRS clouds
and the hydrodynamic simulations suggests beta_v~1.9, consistent with both
Burgers and compressible intermittent turbulence.

Furthermore, the analysis uncovers avalanches of activity which are ruled by
the same dynamical and statistical properties described previously for neuronal

recognizes analogies by applying standard supervised machine learning

asters and vortices have been observed to self-assemble in quasi-two

of the role of the active motors driving this pattern formation, and the
relevance of continuum modeling to filament-scale structures remains uncertain.
Here we present results of numerical simulations of a discrete filament-motor
protein model confined to a pressurised cylindrical box. Stable spindles,
nematic configurations, asters and high-density semi-asters spontaneously
emerge, the latter pair having also been observed in cytosol confined within
emulsion droplets. State diagrams are presented delineating each stationary
state as the pressure, motor speed and motor density are varied. We further
highlight a parameter regime where vortices form exhibiting collective rotation
of all filaments, but have a finite life-time before contracting to a
semi-aster. Quantifying the distribution of life-times suggests this
contraction is a Poisson process. Equivalent systems with fixed volume exhibit
persistent vortices with stochastic switching in the direction of rotation,
with switching times obeying similar statistics to contraction times in
pressurised systems. Furthermore, we show that increasing the detachment rate
of motors from filament plus-ends can both destroy vortices and turn some
asters into vortices. Based on our findings we argue the need for a deeper
understanding of the microscopic activities underpinning macroscopic
self-organization in active gels and urge further experiments to help bridge

portal for direct production in colliders or fixed targets. Indeed, this
framework endows the neutrino beams produced at fixed-target facilities with a
companion `dark matter beam', which may be detected via an excess of elastic
scattering events off electrons or nuclei in the (near-)detector. We study the
high luminosity proton fixed-target experiments at LSND and MiniBooNE, and
determine that the ensuing sensitivity to light dark matter generally surpasses
that of other direct probes. For scenarios with a kinetically-mixed U(1)'

accurately earlier in the deal lifecycle than LivingSocial deals due to the
final number of deal purchases saturating quicker. One possible explanation for
this is that the incentive to socially propagate a deal is based on an
individual threshold in LivingSocial, whereas in Groupon it is based on a
collective threshold, which is reached very early. Furthermore, the personal
benefit of propagating a deal is also greater in LivingSocial.

The corresponding random-phase approximation calculations provide a negligible
strength distribution for both nuclei in the energy region from 5 to 10 MeV.
The inclusion and the coupling of 2 particle-2 hole configurations in the
second random-phase approximation lead to an appreciable dipole response at low
energies for the neutron-rich nucleus $^{48}$Ca. The presence of a neutron skin
in the nucleus $^{48}$Ca would suggest the interpretation of the low-lying
response in terms of a pygmy excitation. The composition of the excitation
modes (content of 1 particle-1 hole and 2 particle-2 hole configurations),
their transition densities and their collectivity (number and coherence of the
different contributions) are analyzed. This analysis indicates that, in
general, these excitations cannot be clearly interpreted in terms of
oscillations of the neutron skin against the core with the exception of the
peak with the largest $B(E1)$ value, which is located at 9.09 MeV. For this
peak the neutron transition density dominates and the neutron and proton
transition densities oscillate out of phase in the internal part of the nucleus
leading to a strong mixing of isoscalar and isovector components. Therefore,
this state shows some features usually associated to pygmy resonances.

main-sequence binary KOI-54 by the KEPLER satellite provides a unique
opportunity for studying dynamical tides in eccentric binary systems. We
develop a general theory of tidal excitation of oscillation modes of rotating
binary stars, and apply our theory to tidally excited gravity modes (g-modes)
in KOI-54. The strongest observed oscillations, which occur at 90 and 91 times
the orbital frequency, are likely due to prograde m=2 modes (relative to the
stellar spin axis) locked in resonance with the orbit. The remaining flux
oscillations with frequencies that are integer multiples of the orbital
frequency are likely due to nearly resonant m=0 g-modes; such axisymmetric
modes generate larger flux variations compared to the m=2 modes, assuming that
the spin inclination angle of the star is comparable to the orbital inclination
angle. We examine the process of resonance mode locking under the combined
effects of dynamical tides on the stellar spin and orbit and the intrinsic
stellar spindown. We show that KOI-54 can naturally evolve into a state in
which at least one m=2 mode is locked in resonance with the orbital frequency.
Our analysis provides an explanation for the fact that only oscillations with
frequencies less than 90-100 times the orbital frequency are observed. We have
also found evidence from the published KEPLER result that three-mode nonlinear
coupling occurs in the KOI-54 system. We suggest that such nonlinear mode
coupling may explain the observed oscillations that are not harmonics of the
orbital frequency.

classical interference channel with two independent source-destination pairs
whose communication is aided by an additional node, referred to as the
cognitive relay, that has a priori knowledge of both sources' messages. This a
priori message knowledge is termed cognition and idealizes the relay learning
the messages of the two sources from their transmissions over a wireless
channel. This paper presents new inner and outer bounds for the capacity region
of the general memoryless IFC-CR that are shown to be tight for a certain class
of channels. The new outer bound follows from arguments originally devised for
broadcast channels among which Sato's observation that the capacity region of
channels with non-cooperative receivers only depends on the channel output
conditional marginal distributions. The new inner bound is shown to include all
previously proposed coding schemes and it is thus the largest known achievable
rate region to date. The new inner and outer bounds coincide for a subset of
channel satisfying a strong interference condition. For these channels there is
no loss in optimality if both destinations decode both messages. This result
parallels analogous results for the classical IFC and for the cognitive IFC and
is the first known capacity result for the general IFC-CR. Numerical
evaluations of the proposed inner and outer bounds are presented for the
Gaussian noise case.

interplay of deformations due to multiple contact forces acting on a single
particle. The analytical formulation considers the effects of nonlocal
mesoscopic deformations characteristic of confined granular systems and,
therefore, removes the classical restriction of independent contacts. This is
in sharp contrast to traditional contact mechanics theories, which are strictly
local and assume that contacts are independent regardless the confinement of
the particles. For definiteness, we restrict attention to elastic spheres in
the absence of gravitational forces, adhesion or friction. Hence, a notable
feature of the nonlocal formulation is that, when nonlocal effects are
neglected, it reduces to Hertz theory. Furthermore, we show that, under the
preceding assumptions and up to moderate macroscopic deformations, the
predictions of the nonlocal contact formulation are in remarkable agreement
with detailed finite-element simulations and experimental observations, and in
large disagreement with Hertz theory predictions---supporting that the
assumption of independent contacts only holds for small deformations. The
discrepancy between the extended theory presented in this work and Hertz theory
is borne out by studying periodic homogeneous systems and disordered
heterogeneous systems.

dwarfs, corresponding to an tangential velocity of 87+/-8 km/s. According to
the Besancon galaxy model, this velocity indicates its galactic membership is
probably in the thin disk, with the thick disk an unlikely possibility. Such
membership is in accord with the near-IR spectrum, which points to a surface

to lead to the creation/disruption of matter and radiation, which affect the
cosmic evolution of both matter and radiation components in the Universe. In
particular, we have concentrated on the temperature-redshift relation of
radiation, which has been constrained using a very recent collection of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) temperature measurements up to z ~ 3. For the first
time, we have combined this observational probe with a set of independent
measurements (Supernovae Ia distance moduli, CMB anisotropy, large-scale
structure and observational data for the Hubble parameter), which are commonly
adopted to constrain dark energy models. We find that, within the
uncertainties, the model is indistinguishable from a cosmological constant
which does not exchange any particles with other components. Anyway, while
temperature measurements and Supernovae Ia tend to predict slightly decaying
models, the contrary happens if CMB data are included. Future observations, in
particular measurements of CMB temperature at large redshift, will allow to
give firmer bounds on the effective equation of state parameter w_eff of this
kind of dark energy models.

rich variety of dynamical behavior as a function of the strength of the
quenched disorder, coupling between channels, and external drive. For weaker
disorder, the channels depin in a single step. For two channels we find
dynamically induced decoupling transitions that result in coexisting pinned and
moving phases as well as moving decoupled phases where particles in both
channels move at different average velocities and slide past one another.
Decoupling can also be induced by changing the relative strength of the
disorder in neighboring channels. At higher drives, we observe a dynamical
recoupling or locking transition into a state with no relative motion between
the channels.This recoupling produces unusual velocity-force signatures,
including negative differential conductivity. The depinning threshold shows
distinct changes near the decoupling and coupling transitions and exhibits a
peak effect phenomenon of the type that has been associated with transitions
from elastic to plastic flow in other systems. We map several dynamic phase
diagrams showing the coupling-decoupling transitions and the regions in which
hysteresis occurs. We also examine the coexistence regime for channels with
unequal amounts of quenched disorder. For multiple channels, multiple coupling
and decoupling transitions can occur; however, many of the general features
found for the two channel system are still present. Our results should be
relevant to depinning in layered geometries in systems such as vortices in

can be efficiently implemented using a constant-time or O(1) algorithm. At the
heart of this algorithm was the idea of approximating the Gaussian range kernel
of the bilateral filter using trigonometric functions. In this letter, we
explain how the idea in [5] can be extended to few other linear and non-linear
filters [14, 17, 2]. While some of these filters have received a lot of
attention in recent years, they are known to be computationally intensive. To
extend the idea in [5], we identify a central property of trigonometric
functions, called shiftability, that allows us to exploit the redundancy
inherent in the filtering operations. In particular, using shiftable kernels,
we show how certain complex filtering can be reduced to simply that of
computing the moving sum of a stack of images. Each image in the stack is
obtained through an elementary pointwise transform of the input image. This has
a two-fold advantage. First, we can use fast recursive algorithms for computing
the moving sum [15, 6], and, secondly, we can use parallel computation to
further speed up the computation. We also show how shiftable kernels can also
be used to approximate the (non-shiftable) Gaussian kernel that is ubiquitously
used in image filtering.

accretion) is responsible for the cool (T~10^4 K) halo gas around galaxies, we
embarked on a program to study the star-formation properties of galaxies
selected by their MgII absorption signature in quasar spectra. Specifically, we
searched for the H-alpha line emission from galaxies near very strong z=2 MgII
absorbers (with rest-frame equivalent width EW>2 \AA) because these could be
the sign-posts of outflows or inflows. Surprisingly, we detect H-alpha from
only 4 hosts out of 20 sight-lines (and 2 out of the 19 HI-selected
sight-lines), despite reaching a star-formation rate (SFR) sensitivity limit of
2.9 M/yr (5-sigma) for a Chabrier initial mass function. This low success rate
is in contrast with our z=1 survey where we detected 66%\ (14/21) of the MgII
hosts. Taking into account the difference in sensitivity between the two
surveys, we should have been able to detect >11.4 of the 20 z=2 hosts whereas
we found only 4 galaxies. Interestingly, all the z=2 detected hosts have
observed SFR greater than 9 M/yr, well above our sensitivity limit, while at
z=1 they all have SFR less than 9 M/yr, an evolution that is in good agreement
with the evolution of the SFR main sequence. Moreover, we show that the z=2
undetected hosts are not hidden under the quasar continuum after stacking our
data and that they also cannot be outside our surveyed area. Hence, strong MgII
absorbers could trace star-formation driven winds in low-mass halos (Mhalo <
10^{10.6} Msun). Alternatively, our results imply that z=2 galaxies traced by
strong MgII absorbers do not form stars at a rate expected (3--10 M/yr) for
their (halo or stellar) masses, supporting the existence of a transition in
accretion efficiency at Mhalo ~ 10^{11} Msun. This scenario can explain both

Hilbert transform of a wavelet is again a wavelet. In particular, we provide
sharp estimates of the localization, vanishing moments, and smoothness of the
transformed wavelet. We work in the general setting of non-compactly supported
wavelets. Our main result is that, in the presence of some minimal smoothness
and decay, the Hilbert transform of a wavelet is again as smooth and
oscillating as the original wavelet, whereas its localization is controlled by
the number of vanishing moments of the original wavelet. We motivate our
results using concrete examples.

a contribution to CH$_3$I photodissociation via dissociative electron

delocalized photoelectrons from the substrate causing the observed dissociation

realistic assessment of systematic errors due to the method of data processing,
for example in extracting weak lensing galaxy shape measurements or galaxy
radial profiles, given user-supplied observational conditions and real galaxy
morphologies. Moreover, the simulations allow for the empirical test of error
estimates and determination of parameter degeneracies, via generation of many
noise maps. The public release of this software, along with a large sample of
cleaned COSMOS galaxy images (corrected for charge transfer inefficiency),

the latent variables, which allows quantifying the estimation uncertainty and
learning model parameters using maximum likelihood. The exact posterior
distribution under the sparse linear model is intractable and we concentrate on
variational Bayesian techniques to approximate it. Repeatedly computing
Gaussian variances turns out to be a key requisite and constitutes the main
computational bottleneck in applying variational techniques in large-scale

drawing exact samples from Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF). The main
technical contribution of our paper is to show that estimating Gaussian
variances using a relatively small number of such efficiently drawn random
samples is much more effective than alternative general-purpose variance
estimation techniques. By reducing the problem of variance estimation to
standard optimization primitives, the resulting variational algorithms are
fully scalable and parallelizable, allowing Bayesian computations in extremely

conventional point estimation techniques. We illustrate these ideas with

of ~6 than the published stellar masses using BRIJK photometry; ii) when
estimating stellar masses as 0.7xMdyn, a combination of passive luminosity
fading with mass/size growth due to minor mergers can plausibly evolve our
objects to match the properties of the local population of early-type galaxies.

bulk viscosity tends to promote the Big Rip, we find that there are a number of
situations where this is not the case and where the formalism nicely adjusts
itself to the Little Rip scenario. We prove, in particular, that a viscous
fluid (or, equivalently, one with an inhomogeneous (imperfect) equation of

viscosity and a general (power-like) equation of state is also investigated in
detail. To finish, a physical, inertial force interpretation of the dissolution
of bound structures in the Little Rip cosmology is presented.

halo velocities (v_{12}), and pair separation distances. We then compare our
results to the initial conditions (ICs) required to reproduce the observational
properties of 1E0657-56 in non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We find
that the high velocity tail of the v_{12} distribution extends to greater
velocities as we increase the box size. We also find that the number of
high-v_{12} pairs increases as we increase the particle count and resolution
with a fixed box size, however, this increase is mostly due to lower mass halos
which do not match the observed masses of 1E0657-56. We find that the redshift
evolution is not very strong for the v_{12} distribution function between z=0.0
and z~0.5. We identify some pairs whose v_{12} resemble the required ICs,
however, even the best candidates have either wrong halo mass ratios, or too
large separations. Our simulations suggest that it is very difficult to produce
such ICs at z=0.0, 0.296,& 0.489 in comoving volumes as large as (2Gpc/h)^3.
Based on the extrapolation of our cumulative v_{12} function, we find that one
needs a simulation with a comoving box size of (4.48Gpc/h)^3 and 2240^3 DM
particles in order to produce at least one pair of halos that resembles the
required v_{12} and observed masses of 1E0657-56. We find that the probability
of finding a halo pair with v_{12}>=3000km/s and masses >=10^{14}Msun to be
2.76x10^{-8} at z=0.489. We conclude that either 1E0657-56 is incompatible with
the concordance LCDM universe, or the ICs suggested by the non-cosmological
simulations must be revised to give a lower value of v_{12}.

maximally entangled systems cannot be simulated without classical communication
between the parties. The communication cost is finite for n Bell states, but it
grows exponentially in n. Three simple protocols are presented that provide
approximate simulations for low-dimensional entangled systems and require a
linearly growing amount of communication. We have tested them by performing
some simulations for a family of measurements. The maximal error is less than
1% in three dimensions and grows sublinearly with the number of entangled bits
in the range numerically tested. One protocol is the multidimensional
generalization of the exact Toner-Bacon [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 187904 (2003)]
model for a single Bell state. The other two protocols are generalizations of
an alternative exact model, which we derive from the Kochen-Specker [J. Math.

protocols can give some indication for finding optimal one-way communication
protocols that classically simulate entanglement and quantum channels.
Furthermore they can be useful for deciding if a quantum communication protocol
provides an advantage on classical protocols.

having an exponential degree distribution. First, we address a trapping
problem, that is, a particular case of random walks with an immobile trap
located at the initial node. We obtain the exact mean trapping time defined as
the average of first-passage time (FPT) from all nodes to the trap, which
scales linearly with the network order $N$ in large networks. Then, we
determine analytically the mean sending time, which is the mean of the FPTs
from the initial node to all other nodes, and show that it grows with $N$ in
the order of $N \ln N$. After that, we compute the precise global mean
first-passage time among all pairs of nodes and find that it also varies in the
order of $N \ln N$ in the large limit of $N$. After obtaining the relevant
quantities, we compare them with each other and related our results to the
efficiency for information transmission by regarding the walker as an
information messenger. Finally, we compare our results with those previously
reported for other trees with different structural properties (e.g., degree
distribution), such as the standard fractal trees and the scale-free
small-world trees, and show that the shortest path between a pair of nodes in a
tree is responsible for the scaling of FPT between the two nodes.

theories from a philosophical angle, taking into account the fact that the
notion of a spontaneously broken local gauge symmetry, though widely employed
in textbook expositions of the Higgs mechanism, is not supported by our leading
theoretical frameworks of gauge quantum theories. In the context of lattice
gauge theory, the statement that local gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously
broken can even be made rigorous in the form of Elitzur's theorem.
Nevertheless, gauge symmetry breaking does occur in gauge quantum field
theories in the form of the breaking of remnant subgroups of the original local
gauge group under which the theories typically remain invariant after gauge
fixing. The paper discusses the relation between these instances of symmetry
breaking and phase transitions and draws some more general conclusions for the
philosophical interpretation of gauge symmetries and their breaking.

the electron magnetic moment together with the unified picture of the three

The electric charge is proposed to be a new quantum of flux such that a
two-vortex structure of electron is envisaged. In analogy with quantum
conditions we postulate sub-quantum conditions applicable in a region of the

compressed images. We consider a framework where images are represented under
the form of linear measurements due to low complexity sensing or security
requirements. We assume that the images are correlated through the displacement
of visual objects due to motion or viewpoint change and the correlation is
effectively represented by optical flow or motion field models. The correlation
is estimated in the compressed domain by jointly processing the linear
measurements. We first show that the correlated images can be efficiently
related using a linear operator. Using this linear relationship we then
describe the dependencies between images in the compressed domain. We further
cast a regularized optimization problem where the correlation is estimated in
order to satisfy both data consistency and motion smoothness objectives with a
Graph Cut algorithm. We analyze in detail the correlation estimation
performance and quantify the penalty due to image compression. Extensive
experiments in stereo and video imaging applications show that our novel
solution stays competitive with methods that implement complex image
reconstruction steps prior to correlation estimation. We finally use the
estimated correlation in a novel joint image reconstruction scheme that is
based on an optimization problem with sparsity priors on the reconstructed
images. Additional experiments show that our correlation estimation algorithm
leads to an effective reconstruction of pairs of images in distributed image
coding schemes that outperform independent reconstruction algorithms by 2 to 4

there is a Serre spectral sequence converging to the homology of FL and the

radio telescope at 1540 MHz. At that frequency, the change of relative
intensity between the leading and trailing components is the predominant
feature of mode switching. The intensity ratios between the leading and
trailing components are measured for the individual profiles averaged over a
few minutes. It is found that the ratios follow normal distributions, where the
abnormal mode has a wider typical width than the normal mode, indicating that
the abnormal mode is less stable than the normal mode. Our data show that 84.9%
of the time for PSR B0329+54 was in the normal mode and 15.1% was in the
abnormal mode. From the two passages of eight-day quasi-continuous observations
in 2004, and supplemented by the daily data observed with 15 m telescope at 610
MHz at Jodrell Bank Observatory, the intrinsic distributions of mode timescales
are constrained with the Bayesian inference method. It is found that the gamma
distribution with the shape parameter slightly smaller than 1 is favored over
the normal, lognormal and Pareto distributions. The optimal scale parameters of
the gamma distribution is 31.5 minutes for the abnormal mode and 154 minutes
for the normal mode. The shape parameters have very similar values, i.e.
0.75^{+0.22}_{-0.17} for the normal mode and 0.84^{+0.28}_{-0.22} for the
abnormal mode, indicating the physical mechanisms in both modes may be the
same. No long-term modulation of the relative intensity ratios was found for
both the modes, suggesting that the mode switching was stable. The intrinsic
timescale distributions, for the first time constrained for this pulsar,
provide valuable information to understand the physics of mode switching.

terminology is developed concerning general aspects of sourcing. The term
sourcement is coined to denote a building block for sourcing. No- tions of
allocation, functional architecture and allocational architecture, equilibrium,

outlined. This theoretical work is meant to serve as a point of departure for
the subsequent development of a detailed theory of sourcing and sourcing
transformations, which can be a tool for dealing with practical applica- tions.

acoustics and matter waves in QM, and occupy one part of a parameter space
continuum of wave-manipulating structures which also contains standard
transformation optics based cloaks, resonant cloaks and cloaked sensors. For EM

framework of the reduced phase space quantization of loop cosmology. We apply
our method to the flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker model coupled to a massless
scalar field. We identify the physical quantum Hamiltonian that is
positive-definite and generates globally an unitary evolution of considered
quantum system. We examine properties of expectation values of physical
observables in the process of the quantum big bounce transition. The dispersion
of evolved observables are studied for the Gaussian state. Calculated relative
fluctuations enable an examination of the semi-classicality conditions and
possible occurrence of the cosmic forgetfulness. Preliminary estimations based
on the cosmological data suggest that there was no cosmic amnesia. Presented
results are analytical, and numerical computations are only used for the
visualization purposes. Our method may be generalized to sophisticated
cosmological models including the Bianchi type universes.

specification decouples language design from language processing and, unlike
traditional grammar-driven approaches, which constrain language designers to
specific kinds of grammars, it needs general parser generators able to deal
with ambiguities. In this paper, we propose Fence, an efficient bottom-up
parsing algorithm with lexical and syntactic ambiguity support that enables the
use of model-based language specification in practice.

benefits to other formulations of the Einstein constraints, the puncture method
is reformulated using distributions as source terms. It is shown how the
Bowen-York puncture black hole initial data and the trumpet variation is
generated by distributional sources. A heuristic argument is presented to argue
that these sources are the general sources of spin and momentum. In order to
clarify the meaning of other distributional sources, an exact family of initial

spinning trumpet black hole initial data and black hole initial data with

on the tree-level expression in the transverse momentum dependent factorization
framework, we show that the corresponding asymmetry near the $Z$-pole is
negative, which is opposite to the asymmetry in the low $Q^2$ region, dominated
by the production via a virtual photon. We calculate the asymmetry generated by
the Boer-Mulders effect near the $Z$-pole at RHIC, with $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV. We
find that the magnitude of the asymmetry is several percent, and therefore it
is measurable. The experimental confirmation of this sign change of the
asymmetry from the low $Q^2$ region to the $Z$-pole provides direct evidence of
the chiral odd structure of quarks inside an unpolarized nucleon.
