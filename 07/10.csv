feet on firm ground, unbiased renormalization group analysis is carried out for
iron-based superconductors. It is quite remarkable that, after integrating out
quantum fluctuations, the renormalization-group flows agree exceedingly well
with a mean-field Hamiltonian where interband pair hopping plays an essential
role. Through interband pair hopping, electrons can overcome the repulsive
interaction between them and form resonating Cooper pairs between different
bands. Unlike the conventional superconductors, the pairing mechanism in
multiband superconductors is resonating pair hopping between different bands,
just like the resonating chemical bonds in benzene. The effective mean-field
Hamiltonian spots a small parameter dictating the critical temperature and also
explains how interband pair hopping always enahnces spin fluctuations at the
nesting momentum connecting the Fermi surfaces. In short, no attractive glue is
needed and resonating interband pair hopping is the key to Cooper pair
formation in unconventional superconductors. Implications to cuprates and
related issues are also discussed at the end.

  nuclear physics to cosmology","75 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rising to Mach, the problem of establishing the unity of the physical essence
of the Universe on all space-time scales of its evolution is, apparently, one
of the main problems in contemporary epistemology. The issues are primarily
related to the problems of the dynamics of the Universe, namely, the need to
postulate hypothetical entities - dark energy and dark matter, whose nature is
unknown, but whose contribution to the energy content of the Universe is about
95%. A ""severe trial for the entire fundamental theory"" turned out to be a
discrepancy of 120 orders of magnitude between the experimentally established
value of the cosmological constant and the calculated value of the energy
density of the physical vacuum. Sharp questions arise also regarding the
physical essence of gravitation and the nature of its unique smallness as
compared with other interactions - nuclear ones, strong and weak, as well as
electromagnetic ones. Sufficiently acute problems in the perception of the
Universe as a single holistic system arise also at the level of microscales.
First of all, we mean here the so called low-energy nuclear reactions, which
are realized in the conditions of nonequilibrium low temperature plasma. The
fundamental problems of such processes are usually not widely discussed, and
many physicists are very critical of the very possibility of implementing such
processes. Our main hypothesis for understanding the key problems of
contemporary fundamental physics, including the indicated cosmological problems
as well as a new class of electron-initiated nuclear chemical processes, is to
introduce the basic reference system associated with the electromagnetic
component of physical vacuum - EM vacuum of the expanding Universe, with a
selection of global time t, being common for all points of the expanding
Universe and measured starting from the time of t = 0, which corresponds to the
Big Bang.

cases. Interviews were conducted with key personnel in affected sites. In 2007,
2799, or 2.3% of 119,218 notified TB cases in the province were multi-drug

of XDR TB in the province are only found in uMzinyathi district even though MDR

optically thick medium by solving the integro-differential equation of the
radiative transfer of resonant photons. To solve the differential equations
numerically we use the Weighted Essentially Non-oscillatory method (WENO).
Although the effects of dust on radia-tive transfer is well known, the resonant
scattering of Ly{\alpha} photons makes the problem non-trivial. For instance,
if the medium has the optical depth of dust absorption and scattering to be
{\tau}a>>1, {\tau}>>1, and {\tau}>>{\tau}a, the effective absorption optical
depth in a random walk scenario would be equal to \surd
{\tau}a({\tau}a+{\tau}). We show, however, that for a resonant scattering at
frequency {\nu}0, the effective absorption optical depth would be even larger
than {\tau}({\nu}0). If the cross section of dust scattering and absorption is
frequency-independent, the double-peaked structure of the frequency profile
given by the resonant scattering is basically dust-independent. That is, dust
causes neither narrowing nor widening of the width of the double peaked
profile. One more result is that the time scales of the Ly{\alpha} photon
transfer in the optically thick halo are also basically independent of the dust
scattering, even when the scattering is anisotropic. This is because those time
scales are mainly determined by the transfer in the frequency space, while dust
scattering, either isotropic or anisotropic, does not affect the behavior of
the transfer in the frequency space when the cross section of scattering is
wavelength-independent. This result does not support the speculation that dust
will lead to the smoothing of the brightness distribution of Ly{\alpha} photon
source with optical thick halo.

unrelated machines. A coordination mechanism aims to mitigate the impact of
selfishness of jobs on the efficiency of schedules by defining a local
scheduling policy on each machine. The scheduling policies induce a game among
the jobs and each job prefers to be scheduled on a machine so that its
completion time is minimum given the assignments of the other jobs. We consider
the maximum completion time among all jobs as the measure of the efficiency of
schedules. The approximation ratio of a coordination mechanism quantifies the
efficiency of pure Nash equilibria (price of anarchy) of the induced game.
  Our mechanisms are deterministic, local, and preemptive. Our first
coordination mechanism has approximation ratio $\Theta(\log m)$ and guarantees
that the induced game has pure Nash equilibria. This result improves a bound of
$O(\log^2 m)$ due to Azar, Jain, and Mirrokni and uses a global ordering of the
jobs according to their distinct IDs. Our second mechanism handles anonymous
jobs and has approximation ratio $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$ although the
game induced is not a potential game and, hence, the existence of pure Nash
equilibria is not guaranteed by potential function arguments. However, it
provides evidence that the known lower bounds for non-preemptive coordination
mechanisms could be beaten using preemptive scheduling policies. Our third
coordination mechanism also handles anonymous jobs and has a nice
cost-revealing potential function. We use this potential function in order to
prove the existence of equilibria and to upper-bound the price of anarchy of

at higher energies, 1.1--10 keV, appears to be smaller, $23%\pm4%$. The small
emitting area of the thermal component either corresponds to a hotter fraction
of the neutron star (NS) surface or indicates inapplicability of the simplistic
blackbody description. The X-ray images also reveal a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN)
with complex, asymmetric morphology comprised of a brighter, compact PWN
surrounded by the fainter, much more extended PWN whose spectral slopes are
$\Gamma=1.3\pm0.3$ and $\Gamma=1.7\pm0.2$, respectively. The extended PWN with
the observed flux of $\sim7.5\times10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ is a factor
of 10 more luminous then the compact PWN. The pulsar and its PWN are located
close to the center of the extended TeV source HESS J1356--645, which strongly
suggests that the VHE emission is powered by electrons injected by the pulsar
long ago. The X-ray to TeV flux ratio, $\sim0.1$, is similar to those of other
relic PWNe. We found no other viable candidates to power the TeV source. A
region of diffuse radio emission, offset from the pulsar toward the center of

budget, much smaller than the dimension of the signal, we consider the general
problem of designing compressive measurements to maximize the measurement
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as increasing SNR improves the detection
performance in a large class of detectors. We use a lexicographic optimization
approach, where the optimal measurement design for sparsity level $k$ is sought
only among the set of measurement matrices that satisfy the optimality
conditions for sparsity level k-1. We consider optimizing two different SNR
criteria, namely a worst-case SNR measure, over all possible realizations of a
k-sparse signal, and an average SNR measure with respect to a uniform
distribution on the locations of the up to k nonzero entries in the signal. We
establish connections between these two criteria and certain classes of tight
frames. We constrain our measurement matrices to the class of tight frames to
avoid coloring the noise covariance matrix. For the worst-case problem, we show
that the optimal measurement matrix is a Grassmannian line packing for
most---and a uniform tight frame for all---sparse signals. For the average SNR

equations subjected to a flat, anisotropic Robertson-Walker metric, where the
3D and higher-dimensional scale factors are allowed to dynamically evolve at
different rates. By adopting equations of state relating the 3D and
higher-dimensional pressures to the density, we obtain an exact expression
relating the higher-dimensional scale factor to a function of the 3D scale
factor. This relation allows us to write the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker field
equations exclusively in terms of the 3D scale factor, thus yielding a set of
4D effective Friedmann-Robertson-Walker field equations. We examine the
effective field equations in the general case and obtain an exact expression
relating a function of the 3D scale factor to the time. This expression
involves a hypergeometric function and cannot, in general, be inverted to yield
an analytical expression for the 3D scale factor as a function of time. When
the hypergeometric function is expanded for small and large arguments, we
obtain a generalized treatment of the dynamical compactification scenario of
Mohammedi [Phys.Rev.D 65, 104018 (2002)] and the 5D vacuum solution of Chodos
and Detweiler [Phys.Rev.D 21, 2167 (1980)], respectively. By expanding the
hypergeometric function near a branch point, we obtain the perturbative
solution for the 3D scale factor in the small time regime. This solution
exhibits accelerated expansion, which, remarkably, is independent of the value
of the 4D equation of state parameter w. This early-time epoch of accelerated
expansion arises naturally out of the anisotropic evolution of 5D spacetime
when the pressure in the extra dimension is negative and offers a possible
alternative to scalar field inflationary theory.

""reject types"" in binary classifications without the need for input data of
cost terms. Third, to better understand and select the ITMs, we suggest three
desirable features for classification assessment measures, which appear more
crucial and appealing from the viewpoint of classification applications. Using
these features as ""meta-measures"", we can reveal the advantages and limitations
of ITMs from a higher level of evaluation knowledge. Numerical examples are
given to corroborate our claims and compare the differences among the proposed
measures. The best measure is selected in terms of the meta-measures, and its
specific properties regarding error types and reject types are analytically
derived.

introduced in which several transmitters send messages to several receivers:
Each subset of transmitters transmit an individual message to each subset of
receivers. For such a general scenario, an achievability scheme is presented
using the random coding. This scheme is systematically built based on the
capacity achieving scheme for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with common
message as well as the best known achievability scheme for the Broadcast
Channel (BC) with common message. A graphical illustration of the random
codebook construction procedure is also provided, by using which the
achievability scheme is easily understood. Some benefits of the proposed
achievability scheme are described. It is also shown that the resulting rate
region is optimal for a class of orthogonal INs-GMS, which yields the capacity
region. Finally, it is demonstrated that how this general achievability scheme
can be used to derive capacity inner bounds for interference networks with
different distribution of messages; in most cases, the proposed achievability
scheme leads to the best known capacity inner bound for the underlying channel.
Capacity inner bounds can also be derived for new communication scenarios.

of evidence showing that various meteorological observables indeed respond to
variations in the interplanetary environment. Second, this can be a very
crucial observational constraint since most models proposed so far are expected
to preferentially work in higher latitude regions than the low latitude region
studied here. We have examined daily solar wind speed ${\rm V}$, daily SLP
difference ${\rm \Delta SLP}$, and daily ${\rm \log(BV^{2})}$ using the
superposed epoch analysis in which the key date is set such that the daily
solar wind speed exceeds 800 ${\rm kms^{-1}}$. We find that the daily ${\rm
\Delta SLP}$ averaged out of 12 events reaches its peak at day +1 and gradually
decreases back to its normal level. The amount of positive deviation of ${\rm
\Delta SLP}$ is +2.5 hPa. The duration of deviation is a few days. We also find
that ${\rm \Delta SLP}$ is well correlated with both the speed of solar wind
and ${\rm \log(BV^{2})}$. The obtained linear correlation coefficients and
chance probabilities with one-day lag for two cases are $r \simeq 0.81$ with

modification of a phospholipid membrane. In our experiments, a basic solution
is microinjected close to a giant unilamellar vesicle, which induces a local
chemical modification of some lipids in the external monolayer of the membrane.
This modification causes a local deformation of the vesicle, which then
relaxes. We present a theoretical description of this instability, taking into
account both the change of the equilibrium lipid density and the change of the
spontaneous membrane curvature induced by the chemical modification. We show
that these two types of changes of the membrane properties yield different
dynamics. In contrast, it is impossible to distinguish them when studying the
equilibrium shape of a vesicle subjected to a global modification. In our
model, the longest relaxation timescale is related to the intermonolayer
friction, which plays an important part when there is a change in the
equilibrium density in one monolayer. We compare our experimental results to
the predictions of our model by fitting the measured time evolution of the
deformation height to the solution of our dynamical equations. We obtain good
agreement between theory and experiments. Our fits enable us to estimate the
intermonolayer friction coefficient, yielding values that are consistent with

to enable the estimation of observable signatures, we find analytic solutions
for the mass as a function of distance from the Sun, for insolation
sublimation, impact ablation and explosion. Sun-grazers are found to fall into
three regimes based on initial mass and perihelion: sublimation-, ablation-,
and explosion-dominated. Most sun-grazers are destroyed sublimatively, and our
analytic results are similar to numerical models. Larger masses (>10^11g) with
small perihelion (q<1.01Rsun) ablation dominates but results are sensitive to
nucleus strength, Pc, and entry angle to the vertical, phi.
  Nuclei with initial mass >~10^10g (Pc/10^6 (dyne/cm^2) sec (phi))^3 are fully
ablated before exploding, though the hot wake itself explodes. For most
sun-impactors sec(phi)~1. For small perihelion the ablation regime applies to
moderate masses ~10^13-16 g impactors unless Pc is very low. For higher masses,
or smaller perihelia, nuclei reach higher densities where ram pressure causes
catastrophic explosion. For perihelion < 1.01Rsun, initial mass > 10^11 g
nuclei are destroyed by ablation or explosion (depending on phi and Pc) in the
chromosphere, producing flare-like events with cometary abundance spectra. For
all plausible masses and physical parameters, nuclei are destroyed above the
photosphere.

preliminary insight for finding a preferred linear almost symplectic connection
on M . We rediscover Ph. Tondeur's Theorem on almost symplectic connections.
Properties of torsion of the vectorial kind are deduced.

"1107.1861","Claus Michael Ringel","Claus Michael Ringel","On the representation dimension of artin algebras",,,,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The representation dimension of an artin algebra as introduced by M.Auslander
in his Queen Mary Notes is the minimal possible global dimension of the
endomorphism ring of a generator-cogenerator. The paper is based on two texts
written in 2008 in connection with a workshop at Bielefeld. The first part
presents a full proof that any torsionless-finite artin algebra has
representation dimension at most 3, and provides a long list of classes of
algebras which are torsionless-finite. In the second part we show that the
representation dimension is adjusted very well to forming tensor products of
algebras. In this way one obtains a wealth of examples of artin algebras with
large representation dimension. In particular, we show: The tensor product of n
representation-infinite path algebras of bipartite quivers has representation
dimension precisely n+2.

a function of collision centrality in PbPb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV.
The results are compared to a pp reference spectrum, constructed by
interpolation between sqrt(s) = 0.9 and 7 TeV measurements. The nuclear
modification factor RAA is constructed by dividing the PbPb pT spectrum,
normalized to the number of binary collisions (Ncoll), by the pp spectrum.
Measured RAA in 0-5% centrality bin is compared to several theoretical
predictions.

More precisely, for local coverings we will study (1) the Plancherel formula

to Arthur's conditions, (3) the local behavior of characters of admissible
representations in the nonarchimedean case, and (4) the genuine part of the

formula, we deduce the density of tempered characters for coverings.

priority-based task assignments and reassignments in a 2D-HMS are represented

recent data on real GDP per capita and the rate of unemployment. Our results
show that the change in unemployment rate can be predicted with a high
accuracy. The link needs the introduction of a structural break which might be
caused by the change in monetary policy or/and in measurement units.
Statistically, the link between the studied variables is characterized by the
coefficient of determination between 0.40 (Australia) and 0.84 (the USA). The
residual errors can be associated with measurement errors. The obtained results
suggest the absence of structural unemployment in the studied developed
countries.
