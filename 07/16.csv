  Minimal Currents","24 pages",,,,"math.DG math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce techniques for turning estimates on the infinitesimal behavior
of solutions to nonlinear equations (statements concerning tangent cones and
blow ups) into more effective control. In the present paper, we focus on
proving regularity theorems for stationary and minimizing harmonic maps and
minimal currents. There are several aspects to our improvements of known
estimates. First, we replace known estimates on the Hausdorff dimension of
singular sets by estimates on their Minkowski r-content, or equivalently, on
the volumes of their r-tubular neighborhoods. Second, we give improved
regularity control with respect to the number of derivatives bounded and/or on
the norm in which the derivatives are bounded. As an example of the former, our
results for minimizing harmonic maps f : M->N between riemannian manifolds
include a priori bounds in W^{1,p}\cap W^{2,p} for all p < 3. These are the
first such bounds involving second derivatives in general dimensions. Finally,
the quantity we control is actually provides much stronger information than
follows from a bound on the L^p norm of derivatives. Namely, we obtain L^p
bounds for the inverse of the regularity scale
r_f(x)=max{r:sup_{B_r(x)}(r|\nabla f|+r^2|\nabla^2 f|)\leq 1}. Applications to
minimal hypersufaces include a priori L^p bounds for the second fundamental
form A for all p < 7. Previously known bounds were for p < 2+\epsilon(n).
Again, the full theorem is much stronger and yields Lp bounds for the
corresponding regularity scale r_A(x)=max{r:sup_{B_r(x)}rA\leq 1}. In outline,
our discussion follows that of an earlier paper in which we proved analogous
estimates in the context of noncollapsed riemannian manifolds with a lower
bound on Ricci curvature. These were applied to Einstein manifolds. A key point
in all of these arguments is to establish the relevant quantitative
differentiation theorem.

switched dynamical system, that minimizes a cost functional defined on the
trajectory of the system's continuous state variable. A recent approach to such
optimal control problems consists of algorithms that alternate between
computing the optimal switching times between modes in a given sequence, and
updating the mode-sequence by inserting to it a finite number of new modes.
  These algorithms have an inherent inefficiency due to their sparse update of
the mode-sequences, while spending most of the computing times on optimizing
with respect to the switching times for a given mode-sequence. This paper
proposes an algorithm that operates directly in the schedule space without
resorting to the timing optimization problem. It is based on the Armijo step
size along certain Gateaux derivatives of the performance functional, thereby
avoiding some of the computational difficulties associated with discrete
scheduling parameters. Its convergence to local minima as well as its rate of
convergence are proved, and a simulation example on a nonlinear system exhibits
quite a fast convergence.

excitatory input tends to correlate neurons, while inhibitory feedback reduces
correlations. We demonstrate that heterogeneity of synaptic connections is
necessary for this inhibition of correlations. We calculate statistical

factorizes into a contribution stemming from an effective static-U problem and
a bosonic high-energy part introducing collective plasmon excitations. Our
approach relies on the scale separation of the low-energy properties, related
to the instantaneous static U, from the intermediate to high energy features
originating from the retarded part of the interaction. We argue that for
correlated materials where retarded interactions arise from downfolding
higher-energy degrees of freedom, the characteristic frequencies are typically
in the antiadiabatic regime. In this case, accurate approximations to the
bosonic factor are relatively easy to construct, with the most simple being the
boson factor of the dynamical atomic limit problem. We benchmark the quality of
our method against numerically exact continuous time quantum Monte Carlo
results for the Anderson-Holstein model both, at half- and quarter-filling.
Furthermore we study the Mott transition within the Hubbard-Holstein model

a realistic three-band Hamiltonian for SrVO3. We show that our approach
reproduces both, the effective mass renormalization and the position of the
lower Hubbard band by means of a dynamically screened U, previously determined

also be used within schemes beyond dynamical mean field theory, opening a quite

massive volumes of data. In order to make such a system fault-tolerant, some
form of redundancy becomes crucial, incurring various overheads - most
prominently in terms of storage space and maintenance bandwidth requirements.
Erasure codes, originally designed for communication over lossy channels,
provide a storage efficient alternative to replication based redundancy,
however entailing high communication overhead for maintenance, when some of the
encoded fragments need to be replenished in news ones after failure of some
storage devices. We propose as an alternative a new family of erasure codes
called self-repairing codes (SRC) taking into account the peculiarities of
distributed storage systems, specifically the maintenance process. SRC has the
following salient features: (a) encoded fragments can be repaired directly from
other subsets of encoded fragments by downloading less data than the size of
the complete object, ensuring that (b) a fragment is repaired from a fixed
number of encoded fragments, the number depending only on how many encoded
blocks are missing and independent of which specific blocks are missing. This
paper lays the foundations by defining the novel self-repairing codes,
elaborating why the defined characteristics are desirable for distributed
storage systems. Then homomorphic self-repairing codes (HSRC) are proposed as a
concrete instance, whose various aspects and properties are studied and
compared - quantitatively or qualitatively with respect to other codes
including traditional erasure codes as well as other recent codes designed
specifically for storage applications.

half-light radii range from ~ 0.7 - 3.0 kpc and describe a stellar mass -
radius relation as early as z ~ 3. While these galaxies are best described by
an exponential surface brightness profile, their distribution of axis ratios is
strongly inconsistent with a population of inclined exponential disks and is
better reproduced by triaxial stellar systems with minor/major and
intermediate/major axis ratios ~ 0.3 and 0.7 respectively. While rest-UV and
rest-optical morphologies are generally similar for a subset of galaxies with

constrain the merger fraction, finding that morphologically-identified
mergers/non-mergers generally have insignificant differences in terms of
physical observables such as stellar mass and star formation rate, although

Br{\gamma} and high-ionization lines [Sivi], [Alix] and [Caviii] on scales <300
pc from the AGN. The observations reveal kinematic signatures of rotation and
outflow in the NLR and CLR. The spatially resolved kinematics can be modeled as
a combination of an outflow bicone and a rotating disk coincident with the
molecular gas. High-excitation emission is seen in both components, suggesting
it is leaking out of a clumpy torus. While NGC 1068 (Seyfert 2) is viewed
nearly edge-on, intermediate-type Seyferts are viewed at intermediate angles,
consistent with unified schemes. A correlation between the outflow velocity and
the molecular gas mass in r<30 pc indicates that the accumulation of gas around
the AGN increases the collimation and velocity of the outflow. The outflow rate
is 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than the accretion rate, implying that the
outflow is mass-loaded by the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In half of
the observed AGN the kinetic power of the outflow is of the order of the power
required by two-stage feedback models to be thermally coupled to the ISM and
match the M-{\sigma}* relation. In these objects the radio jet is clearly
interacting with the ISM, indicative of a link between jet power and outflow
power.

spatially-resolved imaging in the near-IR with the VLT/NACO/S13 camera, which
probes projected distances from the primary of typically 0.1 to 7 arcsec. The
sample includes the stars DoAr 21, HD 135344B (SAO 206462), HR 4796A, T Cha,
and TW Hya, spanning ages of less than 1 to 10 Myr, spectral types of A0 to K7,
and hole/gap outer radii of 4 to 100 AU. Methods. In order to enhance the
contrast and to avoid saturation at the core of the point-spread function
(PSF), we use narrow-band filters at 1.75 and 2.12 {\mu}m. The ""locally
optimized combination of images"" (LOCI) algorithm is applied for an optimal
speckle noise removal and PSF subtraction, providing an increase of 0.5-1.5 mag
in contrast over the classic method. Results. With the proviso that we could
have missed companions owing to unfavorable projections, the VLT/NACO
observations rule out the presence of unresolved companions down to an inner
radius of about 0"".1 from the primary in all five transitional disks and with a
detection limit of 2 to 5 mag in contrast. In the disk outer regions the
detection limits typically reach 8 to 9 mag in contrast and 4.7 mag for T Cha.
Hence, the NACO images resolve part of the inner hole/gap region of all disks
with the exception of TW Hya, for which the inner hole is only 4 AU. The
5{\sigma} sensitivity profiles, together with a selected evolutionary model,
allow to discard stellar companions within the inner hole/gap region of T Cha,

only object from the sample of five disks for which the NACO images are
sensitive enough for a detection of objects less massive than \sim 13 MJup that

X-rays. Observed X-rays instead originate from the boundary layer between the

optical brightness. Here we present RXTE monitoring observations of two dwarf
novae, VW Hyi and WW Cet, confirming the optical/X-ray anti-correlation in
these two systems. However, we do not detect any episodes of increased hard
X-ray flux on the rise (out of two possible chances for WW Cet) or the decline
(two for WW Cet and one for VW Hyi) from outburst, attributes that are clearly
established in SS Cyg. The addition of these data to the existing literature
establishes the fact that the behavior of SS Cyg is the exception, rather than
the archetype as is often assumed. We speculate on the origin of the diversity
of behaviors exhibited by dwarf novae, focusing on the role played by the white

the cosmological semi-analytic model L-GALAXIES. We demonstrate that
metallicity is dependent on star formation rate at fixed mass, but that the
trend is opposite for low and for high mass galaxies. Low-mass galaxies that
are actively forming stars are more metal-poor than quiescent low-mass
galaxies. High-mass galaxies, on the other hand, have lower gas-phase
metallicities if their star formation rates are small. Remarkably, the same
trends are found for our sample of model galaxies. We find that massive model
galaxies with low gas-phase metallicities have undergone a gas-rich merger in
the past, inducing a starburst which exhausted their cold gas reservoirs and
shut down star formation. This led to a gradual dilution in the gas-phase
metallicities of these systems via accretion of gas. These model galaxies have
lower-than-average gas-to-stellar mass ratios and higher-than-average central
black hole masses. We confirm that massive galaxies with low gas-phase
metallicities in our observational sample also have very massive black holes.
We propose that accretion may therefore play a significant role in regulating
the gas-phase metallicities of present-day massive galaxies.

M/Msun>10.25). The use of the UVJ diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescent
galaxies from star forming galaxies (SFGs) is becoming more common due to its
ability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened SFGs. Quiescent
galaxies occupy a small and distinct region of UVJ color space and we find most
of them to have concentrated profiles with high Sersic indices (n>2.5) and
smooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. SFGs populate a broad,
but well-defined sequence of UVJ colors and are comprised of objects with a mix
of Sersic indices. Interestingly, most UVJ-selected SFGs with high Sersic
indices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of the
n<2.5 SFGs and late-type systems. Finally, we find that the position of a SFG
on the sequence of UVJ colors is determined to a large degree by the mass of
the galaxy and its inclination. Systems that are closer to edge-on generally
display redder colors and lower [OII]3727 luminosity per unit mass as a
consequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. We conclude that the
two main features seen in UVJ color space correspond closely to the traditional
morphological classes of early and late-type galaxies.

effective power-law photon index of Gamma=0.6_{-0.4}^{+0.3}, indicating a
significant contribution from obscured AGNs. Based on Monte Carlo simulations,
we conclude that 74+-25% of the selected galaxies host obscured AGNs, within
which ~95% are heavily obscured and ~80% are Compton-thick (CT; NH>1.5x10^{24}

X-ray luminosity [ ~ (0.9-4)x10^{42} erg/s in the 2-10 keV band]. The space
density of the CT AGNs is (1.6+-0.5)x10^{-4} Mpc^{-3}. The z~0.5-1 CT objects
studied here are expected to contribute ~1% of the total XRB flux in the 10-30
keV band, and they account for ~5-15% of the emission in this energy band
expected from all CT AGNs according to population-synthesis models. In the 6--8
keV band, the stacked signal of the 23 heavily obscured candidates accounts for
<5% of the unresolved XRB flux, while the unresolved ~25% of the XRB in this

prospects to identify such heavily obscured objects using future hard X-ray

an emission line at ~ 1um with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~ 10. The lines show
asymmetric profiles with high weighted skewness values, consistent with being
Lya, yielding redshifts of z=7.213, 6.965, and 6.844. Specifically, we confirm
the z=7.213 object in two independent DEIMOS runs with different spectroscopic
configurations. The z=6.965 object is a known Lya emitter, IOK-1, for which our
improved spectrum at a higher resolution yields a robust skewness measurement.
The three z-dropouts have Lya fluxes of 3 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and
rest-frame equivalent widths EW_0^Lya = 33-43A. Based on the largest

\noindent The WGE, like many other machine learning techniques, is based on the
exploitation of a spectroscopic knowledge base composed by sources for which a
spectroscopic value of the redshift is available. This method achieves a
variance \sigma^2(\Delta z)=2.3x10^{-4} (\sigma^2(\Delta z) =0.08), where
\Delta z = z_{phot} - z_{spec}) for the reconstruction of the photometric
redshifts for the optical galaxies from the SDSS and for the optical quasars

distributions for the two experiments is respectively equal to 0.021 and 0.35.
The WGE provides also a mechanism for the estimation of the accuracy of each
photometric redshift. We also present and discuss the catalogs obtained for the
optical SDSS galaxies, for the optical candidate quasars extracted from the DR7
SDSS photometric dataset {The sample of SDSS sources on which the accuracy of

broad implications for the final products of planet formation. Previous studies
have attempted to correlate stellar and disk properties with the 10 micron

In this paper, we use spatially resolved adaptive optics spectroscopy of 9 T

between binary stars, such as age, composition, and formation history, have an
effect on dust grain evolution. We find with 90-95% confidence that the

randomly paired single stars, implying that shared properties do play an
important role in dust grain evolution. At lower statistical significance, we
find with 82% confidence that the secondary has a more prominent silicate
emission feature (i.e., smaller grains) than the primary. If confirmed by
larger surveys, this would imply that spectral type and/or binarity are
important factors in dust grain evolution.

observable momentum, and related modifications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle to a so-called generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). We have
proposed a GUP consistent with string theory, black hole physics and doubly
special relativity theories and have showed that this modifies all quantum
mechanical Hamiltonians. When applied to an elementary particle, it suggests
that the space that confines it must be quantized, and in fact that all
measurable lengths are quantized in units of a fundamental length (which can be
the Planck length). On the one hand, this may signal the breakdown of the
spacetime continuum picture near that scale, and on the other hand, it can
predict an upper bound on the quantum gravity parameter in the GUP, from
current observations. Furthermore, such fundamental discreteness of space may
have observable consequences at length scales much larger than the Planck
scale. Because this influences all the quantum Hamiltonians in an universal
way, it predicts quantum gravity corrections to various quantum phenomena.
Therefore, in the present work we compute these corrections to the Lamb shift,
simple harmonic oscillator, Landau levels, and the tunneling current in a

Using the continuity equation that arises from the Klein-Gordon equation, it is
possible to define a normalized absorption rate $\Gamma(t)$ for the scalar
field as it falls into the black hole. It is found that the absorption mainly
depends upon the characteristics wavelengths involved in the physical system:
the mean wavenumber and the width of the wave packet, but that it is
insensitive to the scalar field's strength. By taking a limiting procedure, we
determine the minimum absorption fraction of the scalar field's mass by the

the position of the prominent thermal radio jet which terminates at the HH

there is no general understanding of the conditions required for convergence

of both attenuated max-product (AMP) decoding and weighted min-sum (WMS)
decoding for LDPC codes which guarantees convergence to a fixed point when a
weight parameter, {\beta}, is sufficiently small. It also shows that, if the
fixed point satisfies some consistency conditions, then it must be both the
linear-programming (LP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) solution.
  For (dv,dc)-regular LDPC codes, the weight must satisfy {\beta}(dv-1) \leq 1

{\beta}(dv-1)(dc-1) < 1. A counterexample which shows a fixed point might not

by an acceleration term of 0.458 \pm 0.032 mas/y^2. The parallax is fit to an
accuracy of 0.2 mas and the proper motion terms are fit to accuracies of 0.01

in each coordinate, demonstrating that stellar jitter does not limit the
ability to carry out radio astrometric planet detection and characterization.
The acceleration term originates in part from the companion GJ 896B but the
amplitude of the acceleration in declination is not accurately predicted by the

semi-major axis of 2 AU for a planetary companion to GJ 896A. For semi-major

in heavy-ion reactions at beam energies between 200 and 2000 MeV/nucleon are
studied within an Isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uhling-Uhlenbeck transport model
IBUU11. While the magnetic field can reach about $7\times 10^{16}$ G which is
significantly higher than the estimated surface magnetic field ($\sim 10^{15}$
G) of magnetars, it has almost no effect on nucleon observables as the Lorentz
force is normally much weaker than the nuclear force. Very interestingly,
however, the magnetic field generated by the projectile-like (target-like)
spectator has a strong focusing/diverging effect on positive/negative pions at
forward (backward) rapidities. Consequently, the differential $\pi^-/\pi^+$
ratio as a function of rapidity is significantly altered by the magnetic field
while the total multiplicities of both positive and negative pions remain about
the same. At beam energies above about 1 GeV/nucleon, while the integrated
ratio of total $\pi^-$ to $\pi^+$ multiplicities is not, the differential
$\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio is sensitive to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry
energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$. Our findings suggest that magnetic effects should
be carefully considered in future studies of using the differential
$\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio as a probe of the $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ at supra-saturation
densities.

optimal algorithms require solving an NP-hard sub-problem. To meet the
challenge, one stream of research focuses on finding simpler sub-optimal
algorithms that have low complexity but high efficiency in practice. In this
paper, we study the performance guarantee of one such scheduling algorithm, the
Longest-Queue-First (LQF) algorithm. It is known that the LQF algorithm
achieves the full capacity region, $\Lambda$, when the interference graph
satisfies the so-called local pooling condition. For a general graph $G$, LQF
achieves (i.e., stabilizes) a part of the capacity region, $\sigma^*(G)
\Lambda$, where $\sigma^*(G)$ is the overall local pooling factor of the
interference graph $G$ and $\sigma^*(G) \leq 1$. It has been shown later that
LQF achieves a larger rate region, $\Sigma^*(G) \Lambda$, where $\Sigma^ (G)$
is a diagonal matrix. The contribution of this paper is to describe three new
achievable rate regions, which are larger than the previously-known regions. In
particular, the new regions include all the extreme points of the capacity
region and are not convex in general. We also discover a counter-intuitive
phenomenon in which increasing the arrival rate may sometime help to stabilize
the network. This phenomenon can be well explained using the theory developed
in the paper.

develop nearly zero-defect product, which is achievable through effective
defect management. Inspection has proven to be one of the promising techniques
of defect management. Introductions of metrics like, Depth of Inspection (DI, a
process metric) and Inspection Performance Metric (IPM, a people metric) enable
one to have an appropriate measurement of inspection technique. This article
elucidates a mathematical approach to estimate the IPM value without depending
on shop floor defect count at every time. By applying multiple linear
regression models, a set of characteristic coefficients of the team is
evaluated. These coefficients are calculated from the empirical projects that
are sampled from the teams of product-based and service-based IT industries. A
sample of three verification projects indicates a close match between the IPM
values obtained from the defect count (IPMdc) and IPM values obtained using the
team coefficients using the mathematical model (IPMtc). The IPM values observed
onsite and IPM values produced by our model which are strongly matching,
support the predictive capability of IPM through team coefficients. Having
finalized the value of IPM that a company should achieve for a project, it can
tune the inspection influencing parameters to realize the desired quality level
of IPM. Evaluation of team coefficients resolves several defect-associated
issues, which are related to the management, stakeholders, outsourcing agents
and customers. In addition, the coefficient vector will further aid the
strategy of PSP and TSP

tangible and easily calculable from posterior probability distributions. We
provide an outline of the development of the algorithm and present the results

apply the new algorithm to three M31 satellites: Andromeda I, Andromeda II and
the fainter Andromeda XXIII, using data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological

the low-gain oscillator has been reconsidered as a promising candidate for hard
x-ray free electron lasers, through the use of high reflectivity, high

crystal-based cavity resonant at a higher harmonic of the undulator radiation,
together with phase shifting, to enable harmonic lasing of the x-ray free

effect of dynamical generation of cosmological constant, known to be
characteristic for this formulation of SUGRA, appears in its superfield form,

magnetization it is confirmed that the quantum pressure due to spin-orbit
polarization and the electron relativistic degeneracy has significant effects
on the existence criteria and the propagation of localized magnetosonic density
excitations in GSFDL plasmas. Current findings can have important implications
for the density excitations mechanism and gravitational collapse of the highly
magnetized astrophysical relativistically dense objects such as white-dwarfs,
neutron stars, magnetars and pulsars.

We
extend the Bollob\'as-Riordan polynomial to ribbon graph with this structure.
The extended polynomial satisfies the contraction-deletion relations and
naturally behaves with respect to the partial duality of ribbon graphs. We
construct an arrow ribbon graph from a virtual link whose extended
Bollob\'as-Riordan polynomial specializes to the arrow polynomial of the
virtual link recently introduced by H.Dye and L.Kauffman. This result
generalizes the classical Thistlethwaite theorem to the arrow polynomial of
virtual links.

result is extended from the case of sequence spaces to the case of Dedekind
complete Banach lattices. 2. A new appendix is added to mention some sufficient
and necessary conditions (which are probably already known) for lattices to be
Dedekind complete.
  We deal with the question of whether or not the p-convexified couple
(X_0^{(p)},X_1^{(p)}) is a Calderon couple under the assumption that (X_0,X_1)
is a Calderon couple of Banach lattices on some measure space. We find that the
answer is affirmative, not only in the case of sequence spaces treated in the
previous version, but also in the case where X_0 and X_1 are Dedekind complete
Banach lattices (and provided the same additional ""positivity"" assumption is
imposed regarding (X_0,X_1)). We also prove a quantitative version of the
result with appropriate norm estimates.

function of the number of layers stacked together is investigated using
\textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) including interlayer van der
Waals interactions. Multilayer armchair GNRs (AGNRs), similar to single-layer
AGNRs, exhibit three classes of band gaps depending on their width. In zigzag
GNRs (ZGNRs), the geometry relaxation resulting from interlayer interactions
plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic polarization and the band
structure. The antiferromagnetic (AF) interlayer coupling is more stable
compared to the ferromagnetic (FM) interlayer coupling. ZGNRs with the AF
in-layer and AF interlayer coupling have a finite band gap while ZGNRs with the
FM in-layer and AF interlayer coupling do not have a band gap. The ground state
of the bi-layer ZGNR is non-magnetic with a small but finite band gap. The
magnetic ordering is less stable in multilayer ZGNRs compared to single-layer
ZGNRs. The quasipartcle GW corrections are smaller for bilayer GNRs compared to
single-layer GNRs because of the reduced Coulomb effects in bilayer GNRs
compared to single-layer GNRs.

two-dimensional grain growth, which consists of an infinite number of
nonlocally coupled transport equations for the number densities of grains with
given area and number of neighbours (topological class). For the proof we
introduce a finite maximal topological class and study an appropriate
upwind-discretization of the time dependent problem in self-similar variables.
We first show that the resulting finite dimensional differential system has
nontrivial steady states. Afterwards we let the discretization parameter tend
to zero and prove that the steady states converge to a compactly supported
self-similar solution for a Fradkov model with finitely many equations. In a
third step we let the maximal topology class tend to infinity and obtain
self-similar solutions to the original system that decay exponentially.
Finally, we use the upwind discretization to compute self-similar solutions
numerically.

  Nanoribbons","3 Figures, 4 Pages, Supplementary Material",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efforts to modulate the electronic properties of atomically thin crystalline
nanoribbons requires precise control over their morphology. Here, we perform
atomistic simulations on freestanding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to first
identify the minimal shapes, and then employ a core-edge framework based on
classical plate theory to quantify the width dependence in more general
systems. The elastic edge-edge interactions force ultra-narrow ribbons to be
flat, which then bifurcate to twisted and bent shapes at critical widths that
vary inversely with edge stress. Compressive edge stresses results in twisted
and saddle shapes that are energetically indistinguishable in the vicinity of
the bifurcation. Increasing widths favor the saddle shapes with (longitudinal)
ribbon curvatures that vary non-linearly with width and edge stress. Positive
edge stresses result in a flat-to-curled transition with similar scalings. At
large widths with negligible edge-edge interactions, rippling instabilities set
in, i.e. edge ripples and midline dimples for compressive and tensile edge
stresses. Our results highlight the utility of the core-edge framework in
developing a unified understanding of the interplay between geometry and
mechanics that sets the morphology of crystalline nanoribbons.
