through the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and
communicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the

WMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium,
stringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to
support real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust,

propose a security and privacy protocol that provides security and user

protocol ensures secure authentication and encryption in access and the
backbone networks. The user anonymity, authentication and data privacy is
achieved by application of a protocol that is based on Rivest's ring signature

simulations adopting free-evolution schemes is to modify the continuum
evolution equations so that constraint violations are damped away. Gundlach et.
al. demonstrated that such a scheme damps low amplitude, high frequency
constraint violating modes exponentially for the Z4 formulation of General
Relativity. Here we analyze the effect of the damping scheme in numerical
applications on a conformal decomposition of Z4. After reproducing the
theoretically predicted damping rates of constraint violations in the linear
regime, we explore numerical solutions not covered by the theoretical analysis.
In particular we examine the effect of the damping scheme on low-frequency and
on high-amplitude perturbations of flat spacetime as well and on the long-term
dynamics of puncture and compact star initial data in the context of spherical
symmetry. We find that the damping scheme is effective provided that the
constraint violation is resolved on the numerical grid. On grid noise the
combination of artificial dissipation and damping helps to suppress constraint
violations. We find that care must be taken in choosing the damping parameter
in simulations of puncture black holes. Otherwise the damping scheme can cause
undesirable growth of the constraints, and even qualitatively incorrect
evolutions. In the numerical evolution of a compact static star we find that
the choice of the damping parameter is even more delicate, but may lead to a
small decrease of constraint violation. For a large range of values it results
in unphysical behavior.

subsumption, considers that a subgoal A will consume from a subgoal B if A is
subsumed by (an instance of) B, thus allowing greater answer reuse. We recently
developed an extension, called Retroactive Call Subsumption, that improves upon
call subsumption by supporting bidirectional sharing of answers between
subsumed/subsuming subgoals. In this paper, we present both an algorithm and an
extension to the table space data structures to efficiently implement instance
retrieval of subgoals for subsumptive tabled evaluation of logic programs.
Experiments results using the YapTab tabling system show that our

{\beta} in a system of stacked current sheets that break up into magnetic
islands due to magnetic reconnection. We find significant differences between
{\beta} < 1 and {\beta} > 1. At low {\beta} growing magnetic islands are
modestly elongated and become round as contraction releases magnetic stress and
reduces magnetic energy. At high {\beta} the increase of the parallel pressure
in contracting islands causes saturation of modestly elongated islands as
island cores approach the marginal firehose condition. Only highly elongated
islands reach finite size. The kinking associated with the Weibel and firehose
instabilities prevents full contraction of these islands, leading to a final
state of highly elongated islands in which further reconnection is suppressed.
The results are directly relevant to reconnection in the sectored region of the

file sharing behavior in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. Many current or
envisioned P2P networks reward individuals for sharing files, via financial
incentives or social recognition. Peers weigh this reward against the cost of
sharing incurred when others download the shared file. As a result, if other
nearby nodes share files as well, the cost to an individual node decreases.
Such positive network sharing effects can be expected to increase the rate of
peers who share files.
  In this paper, we formulate a natural model for the network effects of
sharing behavior, which we term the ""demand model."" We prove that the model has
desirable diminishing returns properties, meaning that the network benefit of
increasing payments decreases when the payments are already high. This result
holds quite generally, for submodular objective functions on the part of the
network operator.
  In fact, we show a stronger result: the demand model leads to a ""coverage
process,"" meaning that there is a distribution over graphs such that
reachability under this distribution exactly captures the joint distribution of
nodes which end up sharing. The existence of such distributions has advantages
in simulating and estimating the performance of the system. We establish this
result via a general theorem characterizing which types of models lead to
coverage processes, and also show that all coverage processes possess the
desirable submodular properties. We complement our theoretical results with
experiments on several real-world P2P topologies. We compare our model
quantitatively against more na\""ive models ignoring network effects. A main
outcome of the experiments is that a good incentive scheme should make the
reward dependent on a node's degree in the network.

parameterizes the phase transition due to the underlying particle physics
model, it is independent on the details of galaxy or structure formation and
therefore the DM profile parameters rs, rc, Ec are constrained, leaving only
two free parameters. The high spatial and velocity resolution of this sample
allows to derive the model parameters through the numerical implementation of
the chi^2-goodness-of-fit test to the mass models. We compare the fittings with
those of Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Burkert, and Pseudo-Isothermal (ISO)
profiles. Through the results we conclude that the BDM profile fits better, or
equally well, than NFW, Burkert, and ISO profiles and agree with previous
results implying that cored profiles are preferred over the N-body motivated
cuspy profile. We also compute 2D likelihoods of the BDM parameters rc and Ec
for the different galaxies and matter contents, and find an average galaxy core
radius rc=300 pc and a transition energy Ec = 0.11 eV when the DM halo is the
only component. In Kroupa mass model, we obtain a core rc=1.48 kpc, and energy
Ec=0.06 eV.

we measure the photometric sum, Sigma, which is the relative contribution of
solar features to the disk-integrated intensity of the image. The photometric
sums in the red and blue continuum, Sigma_r and Sigma_b, exhibit similar
temporal patterns: they are negatively correlated with solar activity, with
strong short-term variability and weak solar-cycle variability. However, the Ca
II K-line photometric sum, Sigma_K, is positively correlated with solar
activity and has strong variations on solar-cycle timescales. We show that we
can model the variability of the Sun's bolometric flux as a linear combination
of Sigma_r and Sigma_K. We infer that, over solar-cycle timescales, the
variability of the Sun's bolometric irradiance is directly correlated with
spectral line variability, but inversely correlated with continuum variability.
Our blue and red continuum filters are quite similar to the Str\""omgren b and y

variety of biochemically distinct assemblies including microtubules, actin and

many functional consequences in cytoskeletal dynamics, and its repeated
appearance suggests that it is relatively easy to evolve. Here, we consider the
minimal ingredients for the existence of dynamic instability by considering a
single polymorphic filament that grows by binding to a substrate, undergoes a
conformation change, and may unbind as a consequence of the residual strains
induced by this change. We identify two parameters that control the phase space
of possibilities for the filament: a structural mechanical parameter that
characterizes the ratio of the bond strengths along the filament to those with
the substrate (or equivalently the ratio of longitudinal to lateral
interactions in an assembly), and a kinetic parameter that characterizes the
ratio of time scales for growth and conformation change. In the deterministic
limit, these parameters serve to demarcate a region of uninterrupted growth
from that of collapse. However, in the presence of disorder in either the
structural or the kinetic parameter the growth and collapse phases can coexist
where the filament can grow slowly, shrink rapidly, and transition between
these phases, thus exhibiting dynamic instability. We exhibit the window for
the existence of dynamic instability in a phase diagram that allows us to
quantify the evolvability of this labile phase.

significant electron attachment in the EL field range, ruling out CF4 as an
acceptable additive. The addition of CH4 affects H and its fluctuations to a

choice. In addition, Monte Carlo calculations in pure Xe under cylindrical

Together with the one-loop amplitudes containing the first two generations of

contribution with a large flux of gluons. One of the component parts of this
calculation is the production of a standard model Higgs boson, gg -> H and its

importance of the interference between the Higgs boson production process and
the gluon-induced continuum production in the context of searches for the Higgs
boson at the Tevatron and the LHC. For instance, for mH < 140 GeV the effect of
the interference typically results in around a 10% reduction in the expected
number of Higgs signal events. The majority of this interference is due to
non-resonant contributions. Therefore cuts on the transverse mass such as those
currently used by the ATLAS collaboration reduce the destructive interference
to about a 1% effect. We advocate that a cut on the maximum transverse mass be

concentrated in the 42-kpc diameter starburst ring, but appears dominated by
atomic gas, with a global molecular fraction (f_mol) of only 7.9%. Apart from
the starburst peak, the gas ring is stable against the growth of gravitational
instabilities (Q_gas=2-7). Including stars lowers Q overall, but not enough to
make Q<1 everywhere. The ring's global star formation efficiency (SFE) appears
somewhat elevated, but varies around the ring by more than an order of
magnitude, peaking where star formation is most intense. AM0644-741's star
formation law is peculiar: HI follows a Schmidt law while H2 is uncorrelated
with SFR/area. Photodissociation models yield low volume densities in the ring,
particularly in the starburst quadrant (n~2 cm^-3), implying a warm neutral
medium dominated ISM. At the same time, the ring's pressure and ambient
far-ultraviolet radiation field lead to the expectation of a predominantly
molecular ISM. We argue that the ring's peculiar star formation law, n, SFE,
and f_mol result from the ISM's >100 Myr confinement time in the starburst
ring, which enhances the destructive effects of embedded massive stars and
supernovae. As a result, the ring's molecular ISM becomes dominated by small
clouds where star formation is most intense, causing H2 to be underestimated by
12CO line fluxes: in effect X(CO) >> X(Gal) despite the ring's solar
metallicity. The observed large HI component is primarily a low density
photodissociation product, i.e., a tracer rather than a precursor of massive
star formation. Such an ""over-cooked"" ISM may be a general characteristic of
evolved starburst ring galaxies.

experimentally by an electrical resistivity that is proportional to the square

the effects of winds produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN) on interstellar

10,000 km/s and an initial momentum (energy) flux of ~ tau_w L/c (~ 0.01 tau_w
L), with tau_w ~ 1-10. The AGN wind sweeps up and shock heats the surrounding
interstellar gas, leading to a galaxy-scale outflow with velocities ~ 1000
km/s, peak mass outflow rates comparable to the star formation rate, and a
total ejected gas mass ~ 3 x 10^9 M_sun. Large momentum fluxes, tau_w > 3, are
required for the AGN-driven galactic outflow to suppress star formation and
accretion in the black hole's host galaxy. Less powerful AGN winds (tau_w < 3)
still produce a modest galaxy-scale outflow, but the outflow has little global
effect on the ambient interstellar gas. We argue that this mechanism of AGN
feedback can plausibly produce the high velocity outflows observed in
post-starburst galaxies and the massive molecular and atomic outflows observed
in local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. Moreover, the outflows from local
ultra-luminous infrared galaxies are inferred to have tau_w ~ 10, comparable to
what we find is required for AGN winds to regulate the growth of black holes
and set the M_BH-sigma relation. We conclude by discussing theoretical
mechanisms that can lead to AGN wind mass-loading and momentum/energy fluxes
large enough to have a significant impact on galaxy formation.

spectrum of matter scalars, fine-tuning in the electroweak sector prefers low
values of superpotential mass \mu. In the limit of low \mu, the two lightest
neutralinos and light chargino are higgsino-like. The light charginos and
neutralinos may have large production cross sections at LHC, but since they are
nearly mass degenerate, there is only small energy release in three-body
sparticle decays. Possible dilepton and trilepton signatures are difficult to
observe after mild cuts due to the very soft p_T spectrum of the final state
isolated leptons. Thus, the higgsino-world scenario can easily elude standard
SUSY searches at the LHC. It should motivate experimental searches to focus on
dimuon and trimuon production at the very lowest p_T(\mu) values possible. If
the neutralino relic abundance is enhanced via non-standard cosmological dark
matter production, then there exist excellent prospects for direct or indirect
detection of higgsino-like WIMPs. While the higgsino-world scenario may easily
hide from LHC SUSY searches, a linear e^+e^- collider or a muon collider

the integration over parameter distributions (diffuse fluxes), or by the low
statistics in small burst samples (stacked fluxes). We simulate parameter
distributions with a Monte Carlo method computing the spectra burst by burst,
as compared to a conventional Monte Carlo integration. With this approach, we
can predict the behavior of the flux in the diffuse limit as well as in low
statistics stacking samples, such as used in recent IceCube data analyses. We
also include the flavor composition at the detector (ratio between muon tracks

photohadronic interactions, flavor mixing, and magnetic field effects, are
typically present even in diffuse neutrino fluxes if only the redshift
distribution of the sources is considered, with z \simeq 1 dominating the

can only be interpreted in a model-dependent way, and can be used as a model
discriminator. For example, we illustrate that the observation of spectral

present the first study of the persistent X-ray source Cygnus\;X-1 that takes
into account of all available observational constraints. Our analysis accounts
for three evolutionary phases: orbital evolution and motion through the
Galactic potential after the formation of black hole (BH), and binary orbital
dynamics at the time of core collapse. We find that the mass of the BH
immediate progenitor is $15.0 - 20.0$ M$_\sun$, and at the time of core
collapse, the BH has potentially received a small kick velocity of $\le 77$ km
s$^{-1}$ at 95% confidence. If the BH progenitor mass is less than $\sim 17$
M$_\sun$, a non zero natal kick velocity is required to explain the currently
observed properties of Cygnus\;X-1. Since the BH has only accreted mass from
its companion's stellar wind, the negligible amount of accreted mass is
impossible to explain the observationally inferred BH spin of $a_* > 0.95$, and
the origin of this extreme BH spin must be connected to the BH formation
itself. Right after the BH formation, we find that the BH companion is a $19.8
- 22.6$ M$_\sun$ main sequence star, orbiting the BH at a period of $4.7 - 5.2$
days. Furthermore, recent observations show that the BH companion is currently
super-synchronized. This super-synchronism indicates that the strength of tides

profiles that are sensitive to timescales from 10 Myrs to the lifetime of the
galaxy. We also compare the stellar distributions, surface brightness profiles,
and star formation rate profiles to HI-line emission maps, gas surface density
profiles, and gas kinematics. Our data lead us to two general observations:
First, the exponential disks in these irregular galaxies are extraordinarily
regular. The stellar disks continue to decline exponentially as far as our
measurements extend. In spite of lumpiness in the distribution of young stars
and HI distributions and kinematics that have significant unordered motions,
sporadic processes that have built the disks-star formation, radial movement of
stars, and perhaps even perturbations from the outside-have, nevertheless,
conspired to produce standard disk profiles. Second, there is a remarkable
continuity of star formation throughout these disks over time. In four out of
five of our galaxies the star formation rate in the outer disk measured from
the FUV tracks that determined from the V-band, to within factors of 5,
requiring star formation at a fairly steady rate over the galaxy's lifetime.
Yet, the HI surface density profiles generally decline with radius more
shallowly than the stellar light, and the gas is marginally gravitationally
stable against collapse into clouds. Outer stellar disks are challenging our

challenge has been to define what security is guaranteed when such mechanisms

policies for declassification and endorsement in a language-based setting. The
key insight is that security can be characterized in terms of the influence
that declassification and endorsement allow to the attacker. The new framework
introduces two notions of security to describe the influence of the attacker.
Attacker control defines what the attacker is able to learn from observable
effects of this code; attacker impact captures the attacker's influence on
trusted locations. This approach yields novel security conditions for checked
endorsements and robust integrity. The framework is flexible enough to recover
and to improve on the previously introduced notions of robustness and qualified
robustness. Further, the new security conditions can be soundly enforced by a
security type system. The applicability and enforcement of the new policies is
illustrated through various examples, including data sanitization and

axis of the X-ray emission from the ICM, while their orientation is
perpendicular to this axis. This is consistent with the scenario that relics
trace merger shock waves. The major and minor axis ratio distribution of the
ICM for clusters with relics is also broader than that of the NORAS-REFLEX
sample. We compared the X-ray luminosity and redshift distributions of clusters
with relics to an X-ray selected sample from the NORAS and REFLEX surveys. We
find tentative evidence for an increase of the cluster's relic fraction with
X-ray luminosity and redshift. [abridged]

external current I in a Corbino setup. The asymmetric potential can rectify the
motion of vortices and cause a net flow without any unbiased external drive,
which is called ratchet effect. With an applied ac current, the potential can
rectify the motion of vortices in the channel and induce a dc net flow. We show
that the net flow of vortices strongly depends on vortex density and frequency
of the driving current. Depending on the density, we distinguish a
""single-vortex"" rectification regime (low density) determined by the
potential-energy landscape inside each cell of the channel (i.e., ""hard"" and
""easy"" directions of motion) and ""multi-vortex"", or ""collective"", rectification
(high density) when the interaction between vortices becomes important. The
frequency of the driving ac current determines a possible distance that a
vortex could move during one period. For high frequency current, vortices only
oscillate in the triangular cell. For low frequency, the vortex angular
velocity $\omega$ increases nearly linearly until the driving force reaches the
maximum friction force in the hard direction. Furthermore, the commensurability
between the number of vortices and the number of cells results in a stepwise
$\omega-I$ curve. Besides the integer steps, i.e., the large steps found in the
single vortex case, we also found fractional steps corresponding to fractional
ratio between the numbers of vortices and triangular cells. The principal and
fractional frequencies for different currents are found, when the net flow of
vortices reaches the maximum that is proportional to the frequency when the
density of vortices is low. We have performed preliminary measurements on a
device containing a single weak-pinning circular ratchet channel in a Corbino
geometry and observed a substantial asymmetric vortex response.

detailed elemental abundances (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y,
and Ba) and stellar ages for 26 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the
Galactic bulge. The analysis is based on equivalent width measurements and
standard 1-D LTE MARCS model stellar atmospheres. We also present NLTE Li
abundances based on line synthesis of the 7Li line at 670.8 nm. We show that
the bulge metallicity distribution (MDF) is double-peaked; one peak at [Fe/H]=
-0.6 and one at [Fe/H]=+0.3, and with a dearth of stars around solar
metallicity. This is in contrast to the MDF derived from red giants in Baade's
window, which peaks at this exact value. A simple significance test shows that
it is extremely unlikely to have such a gap in the microlensed dwarf star MDF
if the dwarf stars are drawn from the giant star MDF. To resolve this issue we
discuss several possibilities, but we can not settle on a conclusive solution
for the observed differences. We further find that the metal-poor bulge dwarf
stars are predominantly old with ages greater than 10\,Gyr, while the
metal-rich bulge dwarf stars show a wide range of ages. The metal-poor bulge
sample is very similar to the Galactic thick disk in terms of average
metallicity, elemental abundance trends, and stellar ages. Speculatively, the
metal-rich bulge population might be the manifestation of the inner thin disk.
If so, the two bulge populations could support the recent findings, based on
kinematics, that there are no signatures of a classical bulge and that the
Milky Way is a pure-disk galaxy. Also, recent claims of a flat IMF in the bulge
based on the MDF of giant stars may have to be revised based on the MDF and
abundance trends probed by our microlensed dwarf stars.

of a given volume? In this paper, we present a solution to this problem using
Extreme-Value Statistics, taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity and
its effects on the abundance and the clustering of rare objects. We calculate
the probability density function (pdf) of extreme-mass clusters in a survey
volume, and show how primordial non-Gaussianity shifts the peak of this pdf. We
also study the sensitivity of the extreme-value pdfs to changes in the mass
functions, survey volume, redshift coverage and the normalization of the matter
power spectrum, {\sigma}_8. For 'local' non-Gaussianity parametrized by f_NL,
our correction for the extreme-value pdf due to the bias is important when f_NL
> O(100), and becomes more significant for wider and deeper surveys. Applying
our formalism to the massive high-redshift cluster XMMUJ0044.0-2-33, we find
that its existence is consistent with f_NL = 0, although the conclusion is
sensitive to the assumed values of the survey area and {\sigma}_8. We also
discuss the convergence of the extreme-value distribution to one of the three
possible asymptotic forms, and argue that the convergence is insensitive to the
presence of non-Gaussianity.

users produce all contents, at the same time participation is commonly on a

This means that users have to coordinate their actions and goals, in order to
keep themselves from leaving. While this situation is easily explainable for
small groups of highly committed, like-minded individuals, little is known
about large-scale, heterogeneous projects, such as Wikipedia.
  In this contribution we present a model of peer production in a large online
community. The model features a dynamic population of bounded confidence users,
and an endogenous process of user departure. Using global sensitivity analysis,
we identify the most important parameters affecting the lifespan of user
participation. We find that the model presents two distinct regimes, and that
the shift between them is governed by the bounded confidence parameter. For low
values of this parameter, users depart almost immediately. For high values,
however, the model produces a bimodal distribution of user lifespan. These
results suggest that user participation to online communities could be
explained in terms of group consensus, and provide a novel connection between
models of opinion dynamics and commons-based peer production.

dispersion (celebrated Richardson's mechanism), shear dispersion (particle
separation due to variation of the mean velocity field) and specific
surface-layer dispersion (induced by the gradient of the energy dissipation
rate in the turbulent surface layer). The latter mechanism results in the
rather slow (ballistic) law for the mean squared particle separation. Based on
a simplified Langevin equation for particle separation we found that the
ballistic regime always dominates at large times. This conclusion is supported
by our extensive atmospheric observations. Exit-time statistics are derived
from the experimental dataset and show a reasonable match with the simple
dimensional asymptotes for different mechanisms of tracer dispersion, as well
as predictions of the multifractal model and experimental data from other

front passed over an upflow region nearby a magnetic bipole. Using EIS raster
observations for this region, we studied the properties of plasma dynamics in
the wave front, as well as the interaction between the wave and the upflow
region. We found a weak blueshift for the Fe XII {\lambda}195.12 and Fe XIII
{\lambda}202.04 lines in the wave front. The local velocity along the solar
surface, which is deduced from the line of sight velocity in the wave front and
the projection effect, is much lower than the typical propagation speed of the
wave. A more interesting finding is that the upflow and non-thermal velocities
in the upflow region are suddenly diminished after the transit of the wave
front. This implies a significant change of magnetic field orientation when the
wave passed. As the lines in the upflow region are redirected, the velocity
along the line of sight is diminished as a result. We suggest that this
scenario is more in accordance with what was proposed in the field-line

Least-Square-Deconvolution technique to compute, from each spectrum, a mean
line profile with a signal-to-noise ratio close to 20,000. After averaging all

The shape evolution is moderate in neighboring Kr and Mo isotopes. Similar as
the results of previous Hartree-Fock-Bogogliubov (HFB) calculations with the

to reproduce quantitatively the corresponding charge radii. In addition, the
coexistence of prolate and oblate shapes is found in both $^{98}$Sr and
$^{100}$Zr. The observed oblate and prolate minima are related to the low
single-particle energy level density around the Fermi surfaces of neutron and
proton respectively. Furthermore, the 5-dimensional (5D) collective Hamiltonian

when Saturn reaches the gap-opening mass and is caught in the 3:2 resonance

study the dynamical evolution of Jupiter and Saturn during their growth from 10
Earth masses cores. We have performed numerical simulations using a grid-based
hydrodynamical code. Most of our simulations assume an isothermal equation of
state for the disk but a subset use a fully-radiative version of the code. For
an isothermal disk the two phase migration of Jupiter and Saturn is very robust
and independent of the mass-growth history of these planets provided the disk
is cool enough. For a radiative disk the we find some outcomes with two phase
migrations and others with more complicated behavior. We construct a simple,
1-D model of an evolving viscous disk to calculate the evolution of the disk's
radiative properties: the disk transitions from radiative to isothermal from
its outermost regions inward in time. We show that a two-phase migration is a
natural outcome at late times even under the limiting assumption that

can be observed from the ground have been a puzzle for particle physicists and
astrophysicists. As an attempt to discriminate among several possible
production scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy of
the directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they
are supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the
observations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of
directional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a
nonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative
distributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected
forms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived
from fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.
We use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594
(electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale
indices no larger than some ${J^{\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between
those estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called
Multiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each
choice of $J=1,\ldots,{J^{\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is
based on the single full ${J^{\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet
coefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures
and compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to
isotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic
nonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo
study shows good performance of the Multiple test, even at moderate sample
size, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different choices of
the parameter ${J^{\star}}$. On the 69 most energetic events published by the
Pierre Auger Collaboration, the needlet-based procedures suggest statistical
evidence for anisotropy. Using several values for the parameters of the
methods, our procedures yield $p$-values below 1%, but with uncontrolled
multiplicity issues. The flexibility of this method and the possibility to
modify it to take into account a large variety of extensions of the problem
make it an interesting option for future investigation of the origin of
ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.

transverse momentum spectra of neutral pions in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}$ =200 GeV for different centralities. The fast partons
are assumed to lose energy by radiating gluons as they traverse the plasma and
undergo multiple collisions. The energy loss per collision, $\epsilon$, is
taken as proportional to $E$(where $E$ is the energy of the parton),
proportional to $\sqrt{E}$, or a constant depending on whether the formation
time of the gluon is less than the mean path, greater than the mean free path
but less than the path length, or greater than the path length of the partons,
respectively. NLO pQCD is used to evaluate pion production by modifying the
fragmentation function to account for the energy loss. We reproduce the nuclear
modification factor $R_\textrm{AA}$ by treating $\epsilon$ as the only free
parameter, depending on the centrality and the mechanism of energy loss. These
values are seen to explain the nuclear modification of prompt photons, caused
by the energy lost by final state quarks before they fragment into photons.
These also reproduce the azimuthal asymmetry of transverse momentum
distribution for pions within a factor of two and for prompt photons in a fair
agreement with experimental data.

index size. Accordingly, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the
development of efficient compression techniques for inverted indexes. Roughly,
index compression relies on two factors: the ordering of the indexed documents,
which strives to position similar documents in proximity, and the encoding of
the inverted lists that result from the ordered stream of documents. Large
commercial search engines index tens of billions of pages of the ever growing
Web. The sheer size of their indexes dictates the distribution of documents
among thousands of servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning, such
that each server indexes only several millions pages. Due to engineering and
runtime performance considerations, random distribution of documents to servers
is common. However, random index-partitioning among many servers adversely
impacts the resulting index sizes, as it decreases the effectiveness of
document ordering schemes. We study the impact of random index-partitioning on
document ordering schemes. We show that index-partitioning decreases the
aggregated size of the inverted lists logarithmically with the number of
servers, when documents within each server are randomly reordered. On the other
hand, the aggregated partitioned index size increases logarithmically with the
number of servers, when state-of-the-art document ordering schemes, such as
lexical URL sorting and clustering with TSP, are applied. Finally, we justify
the common practice of randomly distributing documents to servers, as we
qualitatively show that despite its ill-effects on the ensuing compression, it
decreases key factors in distributed query evaluation time by an order of
magnitude as compared with partitioning techniques that compress better.

and radio properties, we construct uniform samples across the three surveys.
This paper is concerned with the clustering properties of these samples derived
from the angular correlation function. The primary aim is to characterise any
evolution in the clustering amplitude of radio galaxies bellow z~0.68.
  We find no evidence for evolution in the large-scale (~1-50h^{-1}Mpc)
clustering amplitude. Our radio galaxy autocorrelations are consistent with
previous findings indicating little-to-no evolution in the redshift range 0.68
to 0 (~6Gyr of time). We also cross correlate radio galaxies with the parent
LRG samples to increase the precision of our results and again find no evidence
for evolution. Our results are inconsistent with a long-lived model for the
clustering evolution that assumes radio sources randomly sample the LRG
population. A model where the halo mass is constant with redshift is consistent
with the data. This is similar to QSOs that have clustering amplitudes
consistent with a single halo mass at all redshifts. Given that the brightest
radio sources show stronger evolution in space density compared to fainter
radio sources we restrict our samples to include only objects with
L>10^{26}W/Hz and repeat the analysis. Again we find no evidence for evolution
in the comoving correlation amplitude. These radio sources appear to inhabit
the same mass halos as fainter radio galaxies (~9x10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot). These
halos are ~twice as massive as those of the general LRG population and ~30
times as massive as optical AGN/QSOs.

area of research. Given a system and a real function (observable) defined on
its phase space, extreme value theory studies the limit probabilistic laws
obeyed by large values attained by the observable along orbits of the system.
Based on this theory, the so-called block maximum method is often used in
applications for statistical prediction of large value occurrences. In this
method, one performs inference for the parameters of the Generalised Extreme
Value (GEV) distribution, using maxima over blocks of regularly sampled
observations along an orbit of the system. The observables studied so far in
the theory are expressed as functions of the distance with respect to a point,
which is assumed to be a density point of the system's invariant measure.
However, this is not the structure of the observables typically encountered in
physical applications, such as windspeed or vorticity in atmospheric models. In
this paper we consider extreme value limit laws for observables which are not
functions of the distance from a density point of the dynamical system. In such
cases, the limit laws are no longer determined by the functional form of the
observable and the dimension of the invariant measure: they also depend on the
specific geometry of the underlying attractor and of the observable's level
sets. We present a collection of analytical and numerical results, starting
with a toral hyperbolic automorphism as a simple template to illustrate the
main ideas. We then formulate our main results for a uniformly hyperbolic
system, the solenoid map. We also discuss non-uniformly hyperbolic examples of
maps (H\'enon and Lozi maps) and of flows (the Lorenz63 and Lorenz84 models).
Our purpose is to outline the main ideas and to highlight several serious
problems found in the numerical estimation of the limit laws.

trace identity of indistinguishable objects in their evolution - only

considers the laminar regime of the vortex-bundle evolution and investigates
the Glaberson-Johnson-Ostermeier instability of the laminar regime, which is a
precursor for the transition to the turbulent regime at strong twist of the

is demonstrated that the vortex front can move with finite velocity even in the

Fractional derivative can be defined as a fractional power of derivative. The
infinitesimal generators {H, .} and L=G(q,p) \partial_q+F(q,p) \partial_p,
which are used in equations of motion, are derivative operators. We consider
fractional derivatives on a set of classical observables as fractional powers
of derivative operators. As a result, we obtain a fractional generalization of
the equation of motion. This fractional equation is exactly solved for the
simple classical systems. The suggested fractional equations generalize a

The calculations are based on a single orbital tight-binding model and the

lattice: only a few repetitions (~6) of the fundamental unit cell are required
to recover the electronic band gap of the infinite lattice as a transport gap

merit, ZT, can exceed 0.25, and it is highly sensitive to the atomic
arrangement of the antidot edges. Specifically, hexagonal holes with pure
zigzag edges lead to an order-of-magnitude smaller ZT as compared to pure

of states, which predominantly occurs for zigzag edges, and of an increased
splitting of the electronic minibands, which reduces the power factor.

also aim to derive information on key physical parameters, such as rotational

CD-641208 (K7V). We also used cross-correlation techniques to determine stellar

the latter gives a smoother distribution of the filling factor. Maps obtained
at two different epochs three weeks apart show a remarkable increase in spot
coverage amounting to ~7% of the surface of the photosphere over a time period
of only ~20 days. The spot maps of CD-641208 from the two methods show good
longitudinal agreement, whereas the latitude range of the spots is extended to
cover the whole visible hemisphere in the TR map. The distributions obtained

studied receding motions of galaxies at local distances of less than 20-30 Mpc
and found that the motions followed the (nearly) linear velocity-distance
relation, known now as Hubble's law. For decades, the real nature of this
phenomenon has remained a mystery, in Sandage's words. After the discovery of
dark energy, it was suggested that the dynamics of local expansion flows is
dominated by omnipresent dark energy, and it is the dark energy antigravity
that is able to introduce the linear velocity-distance relation to the flows.
It implies that Hubble's law observed at local distances was in fact the first
observational manifestation of dark energy. If this is the case, the commonly
accepted criteria of scientific discovery lead to the conclusion: In 1927,
Lema\^itre discovered dark energy and Hubble confirmed this in 1929.

fermions as their creation and annihilation operators obey non-standard
commutation relations, even for the ""fermion+fermion"" composites. Our aim is to
realize the operator algebra of quasibosons composed of two fermions or two
q-fermions (q-deformed fermions) by the respective operators of deformed
oscillators, the widely studied objects. For this, the restrictions on
quasiboson creation/annihilation operators and on the deformed oscillator
(deformed boson) algebra are obtained. Their resolving proves uniqueness of the
family of deformations and gives explicitly the deformation structure function
(DSF) which provides the desired realization. In case of two fermions as
constituents, such realization is achieved when the DSF is quadratic polynomial
in the number operator. In the case of two q-fermions, q\neq 1, the obtained
DSF inherits the parameter q and does not continuously converge when q\to 1 to
the DSF of the first case.

the air is periodically released through series of successive bubbles,

This study was based on a concept of planetary habitability in accordance to
the integrated system approach that describes the photosynthetic biomass
production taking into account a variety of climatological, biogeochemical, and
geodynamical processes. In the present study, we pursue a significant
augmentation of our previous work by considering stars with zero-age main
sequence masses between 0.5 and 2.0 M_sun with special emphasis on models of
0.8, 0.9, 1.2 and 1.5 M_sun. Our models of habitability consider again
geodynamical processes during the main-sequence stage of these stars as well as
during their red giant branch evolution. Pertaining to the different types of
stars, we identify so-called photosynthesis-sustaining habitable zones (pHZ)
determined by the limits of biological productivity on the planetary surface.
We obtain various sets of solutions consistent with the principal possibility
of life. Considering that stars of relatively high masses depart from the
main-sequence much earlier than low-mass stars, it is found that the biospheric
life-span of super-Earth planets of stars with masses above approximately 1.5
M_sun is always limited by the increase in stellar luminosity. However, for
stars with masses below 0.9 M_sun, the life-span of super-Earths is solely
determined by the geodynamic time-scale. For central star masses between 0.9
and 1.5 M_sun, the possibility of life in the framework of our models depends
on the relative continental area of the super-Earth planet.

impact of phosphorus substitution is to suppress the N\'eel temperature TN of
the spin density wave (SDW) state, and to strongly reduce the local magnetic
field in the SDW state, as deduced from muon spin rotation measurements. On the
other hand the superconducting state is observed in the oxygen deficient
samples only after heat treatment under high pressure. Oxygen deficiency as a
result of synthesis at high pressure brings the Sm-O layer closer to the
superconducting As/P-Fe-As/P block and provides additional electron transfer.
Interestingly, the structural modifications in response to this variation of
the electron count are significantly different when phosphorus is partly
substituting arsenic. Point contact spectra are well described with two
superconducting gaps. Magnetic and resistance measurements on single crystals

star coalescence will allow us to measure the effects of the tidal coupling in
such systems. These effects will be measurable using 3rd generation
gravitational wave detectors, e.g. the Einstein Telescope, which will be
capable of detecting inspiralling binary neutron star systems out to redshift
z=4. Tidal effects provide additional contributions to the phase evolution of
the gravitational wave signal that break a degeneracy between the system's mass
parameters and redshift and thereby allow the simultaneous measurement of both
the effective distance and the redshift for individual sources. Using the
population of O(10^3-10^7) detectable binary neutron star systems predicted for
the Einstein Telescope the luminosity distance--redshift relation can be probed
independently of the cosmological distance ladder and independently of
electromagnetic observations. We present the results of a Fisher information
analysis applied to waveforms assuming a subset of possible neutron star
equations of state. We conclude that for our range of representative neutron
star equations of state the redshift of such systems can be determined to an
accuracy of 8-40% for z<1 and 9-65% for 1<z<4.

difficult to detect in the presence of noise. This problem is alleviated if one
can observe samples from multiple realizations of the nonzero values for the
same sparsity pattern. We will refer to this as ""diversity"". Diversity comes at
a price, however, since each new realization adds new unknown nonzero values,
thus increasing uncertainty. In this paper, upper and lower bounds on joint
sparsity pattern estimation are derived. These bounds, which improve upon
existing results even in the absence of diversity, illustrate key tradeoffs
between the number of measurements, the accuracy of estimation, and the
diversity. It is shown, for instance, that diversity introduces a tradeoff
between the uncertainty in the noise and the uncertainty in the nonzero values.
Moreover, it is shown that the optimal amount of diversity significantly
improves the behavior of the estimation problem for both optimal and
computationally efficient estimators.

Lorentz factors to avoid a large gamma gamma optical depth at high energy.
Estimates can be as high as Gamma ~ 1000 in the most extreme cases. This puts
severe constraints on models of the central engine and the jet acceleration in
GRBs. These estimates are however obtained from a simplified single zone model.
We present here a more realistic calculation which takes into account the time,
space and direction dependent photon field existing in an outflow with several
relativistically moving emitting zones. The formalism is general and can be
applied to many models of the prompt GRB emission. We present results obtained
for a numerical implementation in the framework of the internal shock model. We
show that (i) the minimum Lorentz factor Gamma_min in bright LAT GRBs is
reduced by a factor ~ 2-3 compared to previous estimates if the GeV and MeV
emission are produced in the same region, and by an additional factor ~ 2-8 if
the GeV emission is produced at larger radii. We provide an improved
approximate formula for Gamma_min which is in good agreement with our numerical
results and can be directly applied to LAT GRB data; (ii) a delayed GeV onset
can be due to the time evolution of the opacity. As an illustration of these
two first results, we present a synthetic GRB that reproduces most features of
GRB 080916C with a mean Lorentz factor of ~ 340, an optically thin regime for
gamma gamma opacity at 3GeV in bin 'b', a variability timescale of 0.5s in the
MeV lightcurve and a delayed onset of ~ 5s of the GeV emission; (iii) the gamma
gamma opacity can smooth the short timescale variability in the GeV lightcurve.
This last result implies that the observed variability at high energy is not
necessarily a good test to distinguish between an internal and an external
origin for the GeV emission in GRBs. [abridged]

Liouville-like theory. We refine the method and give general formulas for the
corresponding scalar and energy-momentum tensors in Liouville theory. This
enables us to read off the black hole temperature using a relation which was
found about three decades ago. Then the range of application is extended to
include nonspherical black holes such as neutral and charged black rings,
topological black hole and the case coupled to a scalar field. As for the
entropy, following previous authors, we invoke the Lagrangian approach to
central charge by Cadoni and then use the Cardy formula. The general relevant
parameters are also given. This approach is more advantageous than the usual
Hamiltonian approach which was used by the old Liouville formalism for black

mass and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect using cluster samples extracted
from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Overall, the scatter of the
mass-SZ scaling relation is well correlated with the scatter in the mass-halo
concentration relation with more concentrated halos having stronger integrated
SZ signals at fixed mass. Additional sources of intrinsic scatter are
projection effects from correlated structures, which cause the distribution of
scatter to deviate from log-normality and skew it towards higher inferred
masses, and the dynamical state of clusters. We study the evolution of merging
clusters based on simulations of 39 clusters and their cosmological environment
with high time resolution. This sample enables us to study for the first time
the detailed evolution of merging clusters around the scaling relation for a
cosmologically representative distribution of merger parameters. Major mergers
cause an asymmetric scatter such that the inferred mass of merging systems is
biased low. We find mergers to be the dominant source of bias towards low
inferred masses: over 50% of outliers on this side of the scaling relation
underwent a major merger within the last Gigayear. As the fraction of
dynamically disturbed clusters increases with redshift, our analysis indicates
that mergers cause a redshift-dependent bias in scaling relations. Furthermore,
we find the SZ morphology of massive clusters to be well correlated with the
clusters' dynamical state, suggesting that morphology may be used to constrain
merger fractions and identify merger-induced outliers of the scaling relation.

is optimized for processing biomedical scientific literature such as the
abstracts indexed in PubMed. We tested our tool on its impact to the task of

presumably supersymmetric. The space of finite action solutions is found to be
unexpectedly large and includes, besides the Euclidean versions of known
Lorentzian solutions, a number of new asymptotically locally flat (ALF)
instantons endowed with electric, magnetic, dilaton and axion charges. We also
describe new classes of charged asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE)
instantons as well as some exceptional solutions. Our classification scheme is
based on the algebraic classification of matrix generators according to their
rank, according to the nature of the charge vectors and according to the number
of independent harmonic functions with unequal charges. Besides the nilpotent
orbits of $G$, we find solutions which satisfy the asymptotic no-force
condition, but are not supersymmetric. The renormalized on-shell action for
instantons is calculated using the method of matched background subtraction.

giant exoplanet Kepler-17b. The planet has an orbital period of 1.486 days, and
radial velocity measurements from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) show a
Doppler signal of 420+/-15 m.s-1. From a transit-based estimate of the host
star's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effective
temperature T_eff=5630+/-100 K from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellar
host mass of 1.061+/-0.067 M_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 R_jup.
We estimate the planet mass and radius to be Mp=2.450+/-0.114 M_jup and
Rp=1.312+/-0.018 R_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3. The host star is
active, with dark spots that are frequently occulted by the planet. The
continuous monitoring of the star reveals a stellar rotation period of 11.89
days, 8 times the the planet's orbital period; this period ratio produces
stroboscopic effects on the occulted starspots. The temporal pattern of these
spot-crossing events shows that the planet's orbit is prograde and the star's
obliquity is smaller than 15 deg. We detected planetary occultations of
Kepler-17b with both the Kepler and Spitzer Space Telescopes. We use these
observations to constrain the eccentricity, e, and find that it is consistent
with a circular orbit (e<0.0011). The brightness temperatures of the planet the
infrared bandpasses are T_3.6um=1880+/-100 K and T4.5um=1770+/-150 K. We
measure the optical geometric albedo A_g in the Kepler bandpass and find A_g =
0.10+/-0.02. The observations are best described by atmospheric models for
which most of the incident energy is re-radiated away from the day side.

of the decay channel D*0 omega, f_L = (66.5+/- 4.7+/- 1.5) %. In the above, the
first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The results are
based on a sample of (454 +/- 5)*10^6 BBbar pairs collected at the Upsilon(4S)
resonance, with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II storage rings at SLAC. The
measurements are the most precise determinations of these quantities from a
single experiment. They are compared to theoretical predictions obtained by
factorization, Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) and perturbative QCD
(pQCD). We find that the presence of final state interactions is favored and
the measurements are in better agreement with SCET than with pQCD.
