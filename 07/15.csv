arbitrary charges inside is investigated. Our result reveals that the charge
inside the cloak is a crucial factor to determine the detection. When charged
bodies are placed inside the cloak with an arbitrary distribution, the electric
fields outside are purely determined by the total charges just as the fields of
a point charge at the center of the cloak. As the total charges reduce to zero,
the bodies can not be detected. On the other hand, if the total charges are
nonzero, the electrostatic potential inside an ideal cloak tends to infinity.
For unideal cloaks, this embarrassment is overcome, while they still have good
behaviors of shielding. In addition, the potential across the inner surface of
an ideal cloak is discontinuous due to the infinite polarization of the
dielectric, however it can be alternatively interpreted as the dual Meissner
effect of a dual superconductive layer with a surface magnetic current.

$i$ has a cost $c_i$ and the buyer is interested in a set $S$ that maximizes
$v(S)$ subject to $\Sigma_{i\in S}c_i\leq B$. Special cases of combinatorial
procurement auctions are classical problems from submodular optimization. In
particular, when the costs are all equal (\emph{cardinality constraint}), a
classic result by Nemhauser et al shows that the greedy algorithm provides an
$\frac e {e-1}$ approximation.
  Motivated by many papers that utilize demand queries to elicit the
preferences of agents in economic settings, we develop algorithms that
guarantee improved approximation ratios in the presence of demand oracles. We
are able to break the $\frac e {e-1}$ barrier: we present algorithms that use
only polynomially many demand queries and have approximation ratios of $\frac 9
8+\epsilon$ for the general problem and $\frac 9 8$ for maximization subject to
a cardinality constraint.
  We also consider the more general class of subadditive valuations. We present
algorithms that obtain an approximation ratio of $2+\epsilon$ for the general

guarantee these approximation ratios even when the valuations are non-monotone.
We show that these ratios are essentially optimal, in the sense that for any
constant $\epsilon>0$, obtaining an approximation ratio of $2-\epsilon$
requires exponentially many demand queries.

Earth-sized planets and super-Earths in the habitable zones of cool and

system consisting of a star, a transiting giant planet, and a terrestrial-class
perturber, and calculated TTVs for different values of the parameters of the
system. To identify ranges of the parameters for which these variations would
be detectable by Kepler, we considered the analysis presented by Ford et al.
(2011, ArXiv:1102.0544) and assumed that a peak-to-peak variation of 20 seconds
would be within the range of the photometric sensitivity of this telescope. We
carried out simulations for resonant and non-resonant orbits, and identified
ranges of the semimajor axes and eccentricities of the transiting and
perturbing bodies for which an Earth-sized planet or a super-Earth in the
habitable zone of a low-mass star would produce such TTVs. Results of our
simulations indicate that in general, outer perturbers near first- and
second-order resonances show a higher prospect for detection. Inner perturbers
are potentially detectable only when near 1:2 and 1:3 mean-motion resonances.
For a typical M star with a Jupiter-mass transiting planet, for instance, an
Earth-mass perturber in the habitable zone can produce detectable TTVs when the
orbit of the transiting planet is between 15 and 80 days. We present the
details of our simulations and discuss the implication of the results for the
detection of terrestrial planets around different low-mass stars.

$\Z_p$ with 0.000386% fewer monochromatic 4-APs than random 2-colorings; the
proof is probabilistic and non-constructive. In this paper, we present an
explicit and simple construction of a 2-coloring with 9.3% fewer monochromatic
4-APs than random 2-colorings. This problem leads us to consider the minimum
number of monochromatic 4-APs in $\Z_n$ for general $n$. We obtain both lower
bound and upper bound on the minimum number of monochromatic 4-APs in all
2-colorings of $\Z_n$. Wolf proved that any 2-coloring of $\Z_p$ has at least
$(1/16+o(1))p^2$ monochromatic 4-APs. We improve this lower bound into
$(7/96+o(1))p^2$.
  Our results on $\Z_n$ naturally apply to the similar problem on $[n]$ (i.e.,
$\{1,2,..., n\}$). In 2008, Parillo, Robertson, and Saracino \cite{prs}
constructed a 2-coloring of $[n]$ with 14.6% fewer monochromatic 3-APs than
random 2-colorings. In 2010, Butler, Costello, and Graham \cite{BCG} extended
their methods and used an extensive computer search to construct a 2-coloring
of $[n]$ with 17.35% fewer monochromatic 4-APs (and 26.8% fewer monochromatic

analytical calculation of the properties from the partition function is

systems that can serve as good approximations to these prototype systems. We
also develop criteria for constructing small networks to approximate general
two-dimensional frustrated Ising systems. This method of using small networks

surface by varying the grafting density. Droplets are comprised of bead-spring
polymers of various chain lengths. First, both systems, brush and polymer
liquid, are studied independently in order to determine their static and
dynamic properties. In particular, using a numerical implementation of an AFM
experiment, we measure the shear modulus of the brush surface and compare the
results to theoretical predictions. Then, we study the wetting behavior of
polymer droplets with different contact angles and on substrates that differ in
softness. Density profiles reveal, under certain conditions, the formation of a
wetting ridge beneath the three-phase contact line. Cap-shaped droplets and
cylindrical droplets are also compared to estimate the effect of the line
tension with respect to the droplet size. Finally, the results of the
simulations are compared to a phenomenological free-energy calculation that
accounts for the surface tensions and the compliance of the soft substrate.
Depending on the surface/drop compatibility, surface softness and drop size, a
transition between two regimes is observed: from one where the drop surface
energy balances the adhesion with the surface, which is the classical
Young-Dupr\'e wetting regime, to another one where a coupling occurs between
adhesion, droplet and surface elastic energies.

various scales and weight coefficients via an auxiliary construction of
diagonal Pad\'e approximant. In low-energy QCD observables, some of these

$J-J_2-delta$ quantum spin chain (S=1/2) is studied. Two different measures of
the impurity contribution to the entanglement have been proposed: the
impurity-entanglement-entropy S_{imp} and the negativity N. The first, S_{imp},
is based on a subtractive procedure where the entanglement-entropy in the
absence of the impurity is subtracted from results with the impurity present.
The other, N, is the negativity of a part of the system separated from the
impurity and the impurity itself. In this paper we compare the two measures and
discuss similarities and differences between them. In the $J-J_2-\delta$ model
it is possible to perform very precise variational calculations close to the
Majumdar-Ghosh-point (J_2 = J / 2 and \delta = 0) where the system is gapped
with a two-fold degenerate dimerized ground-state. We describe in detail how
such calculations are done and how they can be used to calculate N as well as
S_{imp} for any impurity-coupling J_K. We then study the complete cross-over in
the impurity entanglement as J_K is varied between 0 and 1 close to the
Majumdar-Ghosh-point. In particular we study the impurity entanglement when a
staggered nearest-neighbour-interaction proportional to $\delta$ is introduced.
In this case, the two-fold degeneracy of the ground-state is lifted leading to
a very rapid reduction in the impurity entanglement as $\delta$ is increased.

formation rates (SFRs) of star-forming galaxies at redshift 0 < z < 2.8 from
single-band 24 micron observations, using local spectral energy distributions

based on characterizing the SEDs of galaxies as a function of their LIR surface
density, which is motivated by the indications that the majority of IR luminous
star-forming galaxies at 1 < z < 3 have extended star-forming regions, in
contrast to the strongly nuclear concentrated, merger-induced starbursts in
local luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies. We validate our procedure for
estimating LIR by comparing the resulting LIRs with those measured from far-IR
observations at 0 < z < 2.8. AGNs were excluded using X-ray and 3.6-8.0 micron
observations, which are generally available in deep cosmological survey fields.
The Gaussian fits to the distribution of the discrepancies between the LIR
measurements from single-band 24 micron and Herschel observations have sigma <
0.1 dex, with ~10% of objects disagreeing by more than 0.2 dex. Since the 24
micron estimates are based on SEDs for extended galaxies, this agreement
suggests that ~90% of IR galaxies at high z are indeed much more physically
extended than local counterparts of similar LIR, consistent with recent
independent studies of the fractions of galaxies forming stars in the
main-sequence and starburst modes, respectively. Because we have not introduced
empirical corrections to enhance these estimates, in principle, our method
should be applicable to lower luminosity galaxies. This will enable use of the
21 micron band of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board the JWST to
provide an extremely sensitive tracer of obscured SFR in individual
star-forming galaxies across the peak of the cosmic star formation history.

to result in the successful reproduction of a (dwarf) spiral galaxy without any

observed in a sample of nearby dwarfs. To do so, we extracted the radial gas
density profiles, velocity dispersion (e.g., velocity ellipsoid, turbulence),
and the power spectrum of structure within the cold interstellar medium from
the simulations. The highest resolution dwarf, when using a high density star
formation threshold comparable to densities of giant molecular clouds,
possesses bulk characteristics consistent with those observed in nature, though
the cold gas is not as radially extended as that observed in nearby dwarfs,
resulting in somewhat excessive surface densities. The lines-of-sight velocity
dispersion radial profiles have values that are in good agreement with observed
dwarf galaxies, but due to the fact that only the streaming velocities of
particles are tracked, a correction to include the thermal velocities can lead
to profiles that are quite flat. The ISM power spectra of the simulations
appear to possess more power on smaller spatial scales than that of the SMC. We
conclude that unavoidable limitations remain due to the unresolved physics of
star formation and feedback within pc-scale molecular clouds.

Milky Way galaxy was teaming with starforming and accretion-powered activity --
this paints a rather different picture from the GC as we understand it today.
We examine a possibility that this epoch of activity could have been triggered
by the infall of a satellite galaxy into the Milky Way which began at the
redshift of 10 and ended few million years ago with a merger of the Galactic
supermassive black hole with an intermediate mass black hole brought in by the
inspiralling satellite.

ID141, one the brightest sources detected so far in the H-ATLAS cosmological
survey. ID141 was observed using the IRAM 30-meter telescope and Plateau de
Bure interferometer (PdBI), the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) submillimeter telescope to measure the dust
continuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon
([C I] and [C II]). The detection of strong CO emission lines with the PdBI
confirms that ID141 is at high redshift (z=4.243 +/- 0.001). The strength of
the continuum and emission lines suggests that ID141 is gravitationally lensed.
The width (Delta V (FWHM) ~ 800 km/s}) and asymmetric profiles of the CO and
carbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disc or a merger. The properties
derived for ID141 are compatible with a ultraluminous (L_FIR ~ 8.5 +/- 0.3 x
10^13/mu_L Lsun, where mu_L is the amplification factor, dense (n ~ 10^4 cm^-3)
and warm (T_kin ~ 40K) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star-formation rate
of (0.7 to 1.7) x 10^4/mu_L Msun/yr. The carbon emission lines indicate a dense
(n ~ 10^4 cm^-3) Photo-Dominated Region, illuminated by a far-UV radiation
field a few thousand times more intense than that in our Galaxy. In conclusion,
the physical properties of the high-z galaxy, ID141, are remarkably similar to
those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

wake containing information about the object and its orbit. Using linear
perturbation theory, we analyze the observable properties of the gravitational
wake due to the object circularly moving in a static homogeneous gaseous
medium, in order to derive the Bondi accretion radius $r_B$, the orbital
distance $r_p$, and the Mach number of the object. Supersonic motion, producing
a wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes
spiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The
pitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely
determined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The
arm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,
decreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background
density distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally
concentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs
with the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is
determined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of
nonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner
arm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated
shapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis. The
density enhancement at the center is always $r_B/r_p$ independent of the
nonlinearity, suggesting that massive objects can substantially modify the
background distribution. These detailed understanding of the wake
characteristics will provide an interpretative framework for both further
theoretical works under more complicated situations and future observations to
detect the gravitational wakes of hidden objects.

impressive given the very different approaches of th ese three surveys. A

unique to SHELS_{0.1}. The faint end slope is alpha_{22.5} = -1.52+/- 0.16.
SHELS_{0.1} shows that lower surface brightness objects dominate the faint end

once baryon number conservation is imposed, color & weak triplet scalars with
hypercharge $Y=1/3$ can feature the required flavor structure as a consequence
of standard model gauge invariance. The color & weak triplet model can
simultaneously explain the top FBA and the dimuon charge asymmetry or the
dimuon charge asymmetry and the CDF dijet excess. However, the CDF dijet excess
appears to be incompatible with the top FBA in the minimal framework. Our model
for the dimuon asymmetry predicts the observed pattern $h_d\ll h_s$ in the
region of parameter space required to explain the top FBA, whereas our model
for the CDF dijet anomaly is characterized by the absence of beyond the SM
b-quark jets in the excess region. Compatibility of the color & weak triplet
with the electroweak constraints is also discussed. We show that a Higgs boson
mass exceeding the LEP bound is typically favored in this scenario, and that
both Higgs production and decay can be significantly altered by the triplet.

Observations of gas rich galaxies provide a measure of the slope and
normalization of the BTFR that is more accurate (if less precise) than that
provided by star dominated spirals, as their masses are insensitive to the
details of stellar population modeling. Recent independent data for such
galaxies are consistent with Mb = AVf^4 with A = 47+/-6 Msun (km/s)^-4. This is
equivalent to MOND with $a_0 = 1.3 +/- 0.3 A/s/s. The scatter in the data is
consistent with being due entirely to observational uncertainties. It is
unclear why the physics of galaxy formation in LCDM happens to pick out the
relation predicted by MOND. We introduce a feedback efficacy parameter E to
relate halo properties to those of the galaxies they host. E correlates with
star formation rate and gas fraction in the sense that galaxies that have
experienced the least star formation have been most impacted by feedback.

non-ideal MHD effects. Using a complex chemical reaction network with standard
prescriptions for X-ray and cosmic-ray ionizations, as well as the most
up-to-date results from numerical simulations, we study the non-ideal MHD
effects on the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and angular momentum
transport in PPDs. We first show that no matter grains are included or not, the
recombination time is always shorter than the orbital time in the bulk of PPDs,
justifying the validity of local ionization equilibrium. The full conductivity
tensor at different disk radii and heights is evaluated, with the MRI active
region determined by requiring that (1) the Ohmic Elsasser number be greater
than 1; (2) the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure beta be greater than
beta_min(Am) as identified by Bai & Stone (2011), where Am is the Elsasser
number for ambipolar diffusion. With full flexibility as to the magnetic field
strength, we provide a general framework for estimating the MRI-driven
accretion rate M_dot and the magnetic field strength in the MRI-active layer.
We find that the MRI-active layer always exists at any disk radii as long as
the magnetic field in PPDs is sufficiently weak. However, the optimistically
predicted M_dot in the inner disk (r=1-10 AU) appears insufficient to account
for the observed range of accretion rate in PPDs (around 1e-8M_Sun/yr) even in
the grain-free calculation, and the presence of solar abundance sub-micron
grains further reduces M_dot by one to two orders of magnitude. Our results
suggest that stronger sources of ionization, and/or additional mechanisms such
as magnetized wind are needed to explain the observed accretion rates in PPDs.
In contrast, our predicted M_dot is on the order of 1e-9M_Sun/yr in the outer
disk, consistent with the observed accretion rates in transitional disks.

coupling between gas and magnetic fields in weakly ionized gas such as in
protoplanetary disks (PPDs) because they provide tremendous surface area to
recombine free electrons. The presence of tiny grains in PPDs thus raises the
question of whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is able to drive
rapid accretion to be consistent with observations. Charged tiny grains have
similar conduction properties as ions, whose presence leads to qualitatively
new behaviors in the conductivity tensor, characterized by n_bar/n_e>1, where
n_e and n_bar denote the number densities of free electrons and all other
charged species respectively. In particular, Ohmic conductivity becomes
dominated by charged grains rather than electrons when n_bar/n_e exceeds about
10^3, and Hall and ambipolar diffusion (AD) coefficients are reduced by a
factor of (n_bar/n_e)^2 in the AD dominated regime relative to that in the
Ohmic regime. Applying the methodology of Bai (2011), we find that in PPDs,
when PAHs are sufficiently abundant (>1e-9 per H_2), there exists a transition
radius r_trans of about 10-20 AU, beyond which the MRI active layer extends to
the disk midplane. At r<r_trans, the optimistically predicted MRI-driven
accretion rate M_dot is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the
grain-free case, which is too small compared with the observed rates, but is in
general no smaller than the predicted M_dot with solar-abundance 0.1 micron
grains. At r>r_trans, we find that remarkably, the predicted M_dot exceeds the
grain-free case due to a net reduction of AD by charged tiny grains, and
reaches a few times 1e-8M_Sun/yr. This is sufficient to account for the
observed M_dot in transitional disks. Larger grains (>0.1 micron) are too
massive to reach such high abundance as tiny grains and to facilitate the
accretion process.

redshift z=0.2. At higher redshifts, the PTA error boxes are larger, and may
contain as many as 100 massive-galaxy interlopers. The number of candidates,
however, remains tractable for follow-up searches in upcoming wide-field EM
surveys. We develop a toy model to characterize the dynamics and the thermal
emission from a geometrically thin, gaseous disc accreting onto a PTA-source
SMBH binary. Our model predicts that at optical and infrared frequencies, the
source should appear similar to a typical luminous active galactic nucleus
(AGN). However, owing to the evacuation of the accretion flow by the binary's
tidal torques, the source might have an unusually low soft X-ray luminosity and
weak UV and broad optical emission lines, as compared to an AGN powered by a
single SMBH with the same total mass. For sources near z=1, the decrement in
the rest-frame UV should be observable as an extremely red optical color. These
properties would make the PTA sources stand out among optically luminous AGN,
and could allow their unique identification.

evolution of dark matter starting from a nearly homogeneous field at early
times down to the highly clustered configuration at redshift zero. The density
field is sampled by a number of particles in number infinitely smaller than
those believed to be its actual components and this limits the mass and spatial
scales over which we can trust the results of a simulation. Softening of the
gravitational force is introduced in collisionless simulations to limit the
importance of close encounters between these particles. The scale of softening
is generally fixed and chosen as a compromise between the need for high spatial
resolution and the need to limit the particle noise. In the scenario of
cosmological simulations, where the density field evolves to a highly
inhomogeneous state, this compromise results in an appropriate choice only for
a certain class of objects, the others being subject to either a biased or a
noisy dynamical description. We have implemented adaptive gravitational
softening lengths in the cosmological simulation code GADGET; the formalism
allows the softening scale to vary in space and time according to the density
of the environment, at the price of modifying the equation of motion for the
particles in order to be consistent with the new dependencies introduced in the
system's Lagrangian. We have applied the technique to a number of test cases
and to a set of cosmological simulations of structure formation. We conclude
that the use of adaptive softening enhances the clustering of particles at
small scales, a result visible in the amplitude of the correlation function and
in the inner profile of massive objects, thereby anticipating the results
expected from much higher resolution simulations.

have formed by triggering before the previous star formation activities

Square Degree (400SD) X-ray Cluster survey with radio sources in the NRAO VLA
Sky Survey. Roughly 30% of the clusters show radio emission above a flux
threshold of 3 mJy within a projected radius of 250 kpc. The radio emission is
presumably associated with the brightest cluster galaxy. The mechanical jet
power for each radio source was determined using scaling relations between
radio power and cavity (mechanical) power determined for nearby clusters,
groups, and galaxies with hot atmospheres containing X-ray cavities. The
average jet power of the central radio AGN is approximately $2\times
10^{44}$\ergs. We find no significant correlation between radio power, hence
mechanical jet power, and the X-ray luminosities of clusters in the redshift
range 0.1 -- 0.6. This implies that the mechanical heating rate per particle is
higher in lower mass, lower X-ray luminosity clusters. The jet power averaged
over the sample corresponds to an atmospheric heating of approximately 0.2 keV
per particle within R$_{500}$. Assuming the current AGN heating rate does not
evolve but remains constant to redshifts of 2, the heating rate per particle
would rise by a factor of two. We find that the energy injected from radio AGN
contribute substantially to the excess entropy in hot atmospheres needed to
break self-similarity in cluster scaling relations. The detection frequency of
radio AGN is inconsistent with the presence of strong cooling flows in 400SD
clusters, but does not exclude weak cooling flows. It is unclear whether
central AGN in 400SD clusters are maintained by feedback at the base of a
cooling flow. Atmospheric heating by radio AGN may retard the development of
strong cooling flows at early epochs.

approach, which leads to a minimal set of veto conditions with high performance

triggers from the detector output, then the algorithm selects a new channel
that performs well on the remaining triggers and the process is repeated. This

the magnetic and pairing properties of multiorbital Hubbard models we here
study numerically two types of two- orbital models, both with hole-like and
electron-like Fermi surfaces (FS's) that are related by nesting vectors ({\pi},
0) and (0, {\pi}). In one case the bands that determine the FS's arise from
strongly hybridized degenerate dxz and dyz orbitals, while in the other the two
bands are determined by non-degenerate and non-hybridized s-like orbitals.
Using a variety of techniques, in the weak coupling regime it is shown that
only the model with hybridized bands develops metallic magnetic order, while
the other model exhibits an ordered excitonic orbital-transverse spin state
that is insulating and does not have a local magnetization. However, both
models display similar insulating magnetic stripe ordering in the strong
coupling limit. These results indicate that nesting is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for the development of ordered states with finite local
magnetization in multiorbital Hubbard systems; the additional ingredient
appears to be that the nested portions of the bands need to have the same
orbital flavor. This condition can be achieved via strong hybridization of the
orbitals in weak coupling or via the FS reconstruction induced by the Coulomb
interactions in the strong coupling regime. This effect also impacts the
pairing symmetry as demonstrated by the study of the dominant pairing channels
for the two models.

discretize the stochastic differential equations of motion. These resulting
finite time step integrators necessarily have several practical issues in
common: Microscopic reversibility is violated, the sampled stationary
distribution differs from the desired equilibrium distribution, and the work
accumulated in nonequilibrium simulations is not directly usable in estimators
based on nonequilibrium work theorems. Here, we show that even with a
time-independent Hamiltonian, finite time step Langevin integrators can be
thought of as a driven, nonequilibrium physical process. Once an appropriate
work-like quantity is defined -- here called the shadow work -- recently
developed nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can be used to measure or correct
for the errors introduced by the use of finite time steps. In particular, we
demonstrate that amending estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems to
include this shadow work removes the time step dependent error from estimates
of free energies. We also quantify, for the first time, the magnitude of
deviations between the sampled stationary distribution and the desired
equilibrium distribution for equilibrium Langevin simulations of solvated
systems of varying size. While these deviations can be large, they can be
eliminated altogether by Metropolization or greatly diminished by small
reductions in the time step. Through this connection with driven processes,
further developments in nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can provide
additional analytical tools for dealing with errors in finite time step
integrators.

of discrete sources developed by Jalali and Weissman, we propose a lossy
compression algorithm for analog sources that relies on a finite reproduction
alphabet, which grows with the input length. The algorithm achieves, in an
appropriate asymptotic sense, the optimum Shannon theoretic tradeoff between
rate and distortion, universally for stationary ergodic continuous amplitude
sources. We further propose an MCMC-based algorithm that resorts to a reduced
reproduction alphabet when such reduction does not prevent achieving the
Shannon limit. The latter algorithm is advantageous due to its reduced
complexity and improved rates of convergence when employed on sources with a
finite and small optimum reproduction alphabet.

our analysis yields Rp=4.31 +/-0.06 Earth-radii, and Rs = 0.683 +/-0.009 solar
radii, both about 3-sigma smaller than the discovery values. Our ground-based
transit data at wavelengths bracketing the Kepler bandpass serve to check the
wavelength dependence of stellar limb darkening, and the J-band transit
provides a precise and independent constraint on the transit duration. Both the
limb darkening and transit duration from our ground-based data are consistent
with the new Kepler values for the system parameters. Our smaller radius for
the planet implies that its gaseous envelope can be less extensive than
previously believed, being very similar to the H-He envelope of GJ436b and
Kepler-4b. HAT-P-11 is an active star, and signatures of star spot crossings
are ubiquitous in the Kepler transit data. We develop and apply a methodology
to correct the planetary radius for the presence of both crossed and uncrossed
star spots. Star spot crossings are concentrated at phases -0.002 and +0.006.
This is consistent with inferences from Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements that
the planet transits nearly perpendicular to the stellar equator. We identify
the dominant phases of star spot crossings with active latitudes on the star,
and we infer that the stellar rotational pole is inclined at about 12 +/-5
degrees to the plane of the sky. We point out that precise transit measurements

strong correlations are found between the X-ray luminosity and the optical/UV

very similar to the findings for the luminous AGNs in the previous works. The
correlation between \alpha_{ox} and L_{\nu(2 keV) is very weak as that found
for the luminous AGNs in the majority of previous similar works. We also study
the relation between $\alpha_{\rm ox} and the Eddington ratio L_{bol}/L_{Edd}

in a crystalline lattice of semiconductor materials. The discretized nature of
light propagation gives rise to many new phenomena which are not possible in
homogeneous bulk media, such as discrete diffraction and diffraction
management, discrete and gap solitons, and discrete surface waves. Recently, it
was discovered that applying periodic modulation to a photonic lattice by
varying its geometry or refractive index is very much similar to applying a
bias to control the motion of electrons in a crystalline lattice. An interplay
between periodicity and modulation in photonic lattices opens up unique
opportunities for tailoring diffraction and dispersion properties of light as
well as controlling nonlinear interactions.

the first billion years of the Universe. We examine the joint effects of X-rays
and hard UV radiation from such first-light sources on the hydrogen and helium
reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at early times, and the
associated heating. We study the growth and evolution of individual HII, HeII
and HeIII regions around early galaxies with first stars and/or QSO
populations. We find that in the presence of helium-ionizing radiation, X-rays
may not dominate the ionization and thermal history of the IGM at redshifts, z,
of 10-20, contributing relatively modest increases to IGM ionization, and
heating up to about 10^3--10^5 K in IGM temperatures. We also calculate the 21
cm signal expected from a number of scenarios with metal-free starbursts and
quasars at these redshifts. The peak values for the spin temperature reach
about 10^4 to 10^5 K in such cases. The maximum values for the 21 cm brightness
temperature are around 30-40 mK in emission, while the net values of the 21 cm
absorption signal range from about a few to 60 mK on scales of 0.01-1 Mpc. We
find that the 21 cm signature of X-ray versus UV ionization could be distinct,
with the emission signal expected from X-rays alone occurring at smaller scales
than that from UV radiation, resulting from the inherently different spatial
scales at which X-ray and UV ionization/heating manifest. This difference is
time-dependent, and becomes harder to distinguish with an increasing X-ray
contribution to the total ionizing photon production. Such differing
scale-dependent contributions from X-ray and UV photons may therefore ""blur""
the 21 cm signature of the percolation of ionized bubbles around early halos
(depending on whether a cosmic X-ray or UV background built up first), and
affect the interpretation of 21 cm data constraints on reionization.

where there is a budget constraint on the total payment of the mechanism. An
important question in the field is that under which valuation domains there
exist budget feasible mechanisms that admit `small' approximations (compared to
a socially optimal solution). Singer \cite{PS10} showed that additive and
submodular functions admit a constant approximation mechanism. Recently,
Dobzinski, Papadimitriou, and Singer \cite{DPS11} gave an $O(\log^2n)$
approximation mechanism for subadditive functions and remarked that: ""A
fundamental question is whether, regardless of computational constraints, a
constant-factor budget feasible mechanism exists for subadditive function.""
  In this paper, we give the first attempt to this question. We give a
polynomial time $O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ sub-logarithmic approximation
ratio mechanism for subadditive functions, improving the best known ratio
$O(\log^2 n)$. Further, we connect budget feasible mechanism design to the
concept of approximate core in cooperative game theory, and show that there is
a mechanism for subadditive functions whose approximation is, via a
characterization of the integrality gap of a linear program, linear to the
largest value to which an approximate core exists. Our result implies in
particular that the class of XOS functions, which is a superclass of submodular
functions, admits a constant approximation mechanism. We believe that our work
could be a solid step towards solving the above fundamental problem eventually,
and possibly, with an affirmative answer.

distribution $P(J) = p \delta(J - 1) + (1-p) \delta(J + 1)$, and present a
numerical Monte Carlo study of the critical behavior along the line that marks
the onset of ferromagnetism. The finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte
Carlo data shows that the ferromagnetic-glassy transition line is slightly
reentrant. As a consequence, for an interval of the disorder parameter p,
around p=0.77, the system presents a low-temperature glassy phase, an
intermediate ferromagnetic phase, and a high-temperature paramagnetic phase.
Along the ferromagnetic-glassy transition line magnetic correlations show a
universal critical behavior with critical exponents nu=0.96(2) and
eta=-0.39(2). The hyperscaling relation beta/nu = (1 + eta)/2 is satisfied at
the transitions, so that beta/nu = 0.305(10). This magnetic critical behavior
represents a new universality class for ferromagnetic transitions in Ising-like
disordered systems. Overlap correlations are apparently not critical and show a
smooth behavior across the transition.

related to the Boltzmann-BBGKY / Schwinger-Dyson hierarchy of equations as a
tool for systemizing the contributions of higher order correlation functions to
the dynamics of lower order correlation functions. Together with the large N
expansion discussed in our first paper(MQP1) we explore 1) the conditions
whereby an H-theorem is obtained, which can be viewed as a signifier of the
emergence of macroscopic behavior in the system. We give two more examples from
past work: 2) the nonequilibrium dynamics of N atoms in an optical lattice

thermal fluctuations and the conditions under which the system manifests

that can be imaged down to luminosities fainter than that of the termination of
its white dwarf cooling sequence, thus allowing for an in-depth study of its
white dwarf population. We use a Monte Carlo simulator that employs up-to-date
evolutionary cooling sequences for white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich and
hydrogen-deficient atmospheres, with carbon-oxygen and helium cores. The
cooling sequences for carbon-oxygen cores account for the delays introduced by
both Ne^22 sedimentation in the liquid phase and by carbon-oxygen phase
separation upon crystallization. We do not find evidence for a substantial
fraction of helium-core white dwarfs, and hence our results support the
suggestion that the origin of the bright peak of the white dwarf luminosity
function can only be attributed to a population of unresolved binary white
dwarfs. Moreover, our results indicate that the number distribution of
secondary masses of the population of unresolved binaries has to increase with
increasing mass ratio between the secondary and primary components of the
progenitor system. We also find that the observed cooling sequence appears to
be able to constrain the presence of progenitor sub-populations with different
chemical compositions and the fraction of non-DA white dwarfs. Our simulations
place interesting constraints on important characteristics of the stellar
populations of NGC 6791. In particular, we find that the fraction of single
helium-core white dwarfs must be smaller than 5%, that a sub-population of
stars with zero metallicity must be <12%, while if the adopted metallicity of
the sub-population is solar the upper limit is ~8%. Finally, we also find that
the fraction of non-DA white dwarfs in this particular cluster is surprinsingly
small <6%.

properties of three interacting particles confined to two dimensions. The
pertinent equations are first formulated for a system of two identical and one
distinct particle and the two different two-body subsystems are characterized
by two-body energies and masses. The three-body energy in units of one of the
two-body energies is a universal function of the other two-body energy and the
mass ratio. We derive convenient analytical formulae for calculations of the
three-body energy as function of these two independent parameters and exhibit
the results as universal curves. In particular, we show that the three-body
system can have any number of stable bound states. When the mass ratio of the
distinct to identical particles is greater than 0.22 we find that at most two
stable bound states exist, while for two heavy and one light mass an increasing
number of bound states is possible. The specific number of stable bound states
depends on the ratio of two-body bound state energies and on the mass ratio and
we map out an energy-mass phase-diagram of the number of stable bound states.
Realizable systems of both fermions and bosons are discussed in this framework.

and the deflection angle, which are found to depend closely on the cosmic
string parameter $\beta$ and dimensionless spin $a_{*}$. The magnification and
positions of relativistic images are also computed in the strong deflection
limit and a two-dimensional lens equation is derived. The most important and
outstanding effect is that the caustics drift away from the optical axis and
shift in the clockwise direction with respect to the Kerr black hole. For fixed
$a_{*}$ of the black hole, the caustics drift farther away from the optical
axis for a large value of $\beta$. And for fixed $\beta$, they drift farther
for high $a_{*}$. We also obtain the intersections of the critical curves with
the equatorial plane, which decrease with $a_{*}$ and $\beta$. In particular,
we obtain a quantity $\bar{\mu}_{k+1}/\bar{\mu}_{k}$, which is independent of
the black hole spin and mass. Thus, through measuring it, one is allowed to
determine the value of $\beta$ from astronomical observations.

an illustration, the fluxes of gamma rays from the Fornax cluster in the

any assumptions on details of the DM model, the predictions turn out to be
either in disagreement with or only marginally below the upper limits measured
recently by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration. In addition, these DM induced ICS
gamma rays in the GeV range are shown to be almost independent of choices of
cosmic ray propagation model and of DM density profile, when a given

decays.

from its biological functions and cell packaging. If the local mechanical
properties of DNA change under torsional and tensional stress, the activity of
DNA-modifying proteins and transcription factors can be affected and regulated
allosterically. To check this possibility, appropriate steady forces and
torques were applied in the course of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
of DNA with AT- and GC-alternating sequences. It is found that the stretching
rigidity grows with tension as well as twisting. The torsional rigidity is not
affected by stretching, but it varies with twisting very strongly, and
differently for the two sequences. Surprisingly, for AT-alternating DNA it
passes through a minimum with the average twist close to the experimental value
in solution. For this fragment, but not for the GC-alternating sequence, the
bending rigidity noticeably changes with both twisting and stretching. The
results have important biological implications and shed light upon earlier
experimental observations.

graphene samples of length L and contact potential U. At times shorter than
both relevant time scales, the flight time and \hslash/U, the major effect of
the electric field is to create electron - hole pairs, i.e. causing interband
transitions. In linear response this leads (for width W>>L) to conductivity
pi/2 e^{2}/h. On the other hand, at times lager than the two scales the
mechanism and value are different. It is shown that the conductivity approaches
its intraband value, equal to the one obtained within the Landauer-Butticker
approach resulting from evanescent waves. It is equal to 4/pi e^{2}/h for W>>L.
The interband transitions, within linear response, are unimportant in this
limit. Between these extremes there is a crossover behaviour dependent on the
ratio between the two time scales. At strong electric fields (beyond linear
reponse) the interband process dominates. The electron-hole mechanism is
universal, namely does not depend on geometry (aspect ratio, topology of
boundary conditions, properties of leads), while the evanescent modes mechanism
depends on all of them. On basis of the results we determine, that while in
absorption measurements and in DC transport in suspended graphene the first
conductivity value was measured, the latter one would appear in experiments on
small ballistic graphene flakes on substrate.

properties of two-dimensional elongated grains. In deposits of non-cohesive
rods in 2D, the topology of the packing is mainly dominated by the formation of
ordered structures of aligned rods. Elongated particles tend to align
horizontally and the stress is mainly transmitted from top to bottom, revealing
an asymmetric distribution of local stress. However, for deposits of cohesive
particles, the preferred horizontal orientation disappears. Very elongated
particles with strong attractive forces form extremely loose structures,
characterized by an orientation distribution, which tends to a uniform behavior
when increasing the Bond number. As a result of these changes, the pressure
distribution in the deposits changes qualitatively. The isotropic part of the
local stress is notably enhanced with respect to the deviatoric part, which is
related to the gravity direction. Consequently, the lateral stress transmission
is dominated by the enhanced disorder and leads to a faster pressure saturation
with depth.

reasonable for many discs, it is not appropriate when self-gravity is
important. In this case, spiral waves and shocks cause temperature and density
variations that affect the chemistry. We have adopted a dynamical model of a
solar-mass star surrounded by a massive (0.39 Msun), self-gravitating disc,
similar to those that may be found around Class 0 and early Class I protostars,
in a study of disc chemistry. We find that for each of a number of species,
e.g. H2O, adsorption and desorption dominate the changes in the gas-phase
fractional abundance; because the desorption rates are very sensitive to
temperature, maps of the emissions from such species should reveal the
locations of shocks of varying strengths. The gas-phase fractional abundances
of some other species, e.g. CS, are also affected by gas-phase reactions,
particularly in warm shocked regions. We conclude that the dynamics of massive
discs have a strong impact on how they appear when imaged in the emission lines
of various molecular species.

demonstrated that, under some conditions, the associated approximations exhibit
a strong law of large numbers; our proof technique is via the Poisson equation

interstellar scintillation (ISS) parameters for the pulsar at the frequency at
which it was never studied in detail. To achieve this the 20 observing sessions
consisted of 3-minute integrations which on average lasted 24 hours.
  Flux density time series obtained for each session were analysed using
structure functions. For some of the individual sessions as well as for the
general average structure function we were able to identify two distinctive
timescales present, the timescales of diffractive and refractive
scintillations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case when both
scintillation timescales, t_DISS=42.7 minutes and t_RISS=305 minutes, were
observed simultaneously in a uniform data set and estimated using the same
method.
  The obtained values of the ISS parameters combined with the data found in the
literature allowed us to study the frequency dependence of these parameters
over a wide range of observing frequencies, which is crucial for understanding
the ISM turbulence. We found that the Kolmogorov spectrum is not best suited
for describing the density fluctuations of the ISM, and a power-law spectrum
with beta =4 seems to fit better with our results. We were also able to
estimate the transition frequency (transition from strong to weak scintillation
regimes) as 10.1 GHz, much higher than was previously predicted. We were also
able to estimate the strength of scattering parameter u=2.67$ and the Fresnel

however, a band series was detected which was never observed earlier. In the
spectra of Ar-N2 clusters, this new series coexisted with the 'bulk' w->X
transitions. Our analysis demonstrated that the series should be assigned to
emission of van der Waals (N2)2 dimers from inside clusters. Earlier, such
dimers were only observed in molecular beams and gaseous nitrogen, this paper
reports their observation in the solid phase of nitrogen suggesting that they
may be the basic building blocks of small N2 clusters. Our results can be of
interest from the viewpoint of producing polymeric nitrogen since (N2)2 dimers
can be considered to be a starting species for its synthesis.

considerable attention. In short, a user searching for a target object
navigates through a database in the following manner: the user is asked to
select the object most similar to her target from a small list of objects. A
new object list is then presented to the user based on her earlier selection.
This process is repeated until the target is included in the list presented, at
which point the search terminates. This problem is known to be strongly related
to the small-world network design problem.
  However, contrary to prior work, which focuses on cases where objects in the
database are equally popular, we consider here the case where the demand for
objects may be heterogeneous. We show that, under heterogeneous demand, the
small-world network design problem is NP-hard. Given the above negative result,
we propose a novel mechanism for small-world design and provide an upper bound
on its performance under heterogeneous demand. The above mechanism has a
natural equivalent in the context of content search through comparisons, and we
establish both an upper bound and a lower bound for the performance of this
mechanism. These bounds are intuitively appealing, as they depend on the
entropy of the demand as well as its doubling constant, a quantity capturing
the topology of the set of target objects. They also illustrate interesting
connections between comparison-based search to classic results from information
theory. Finally, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm for content search
that meets the performance guarantees achieved by the above mechanisms.

made bipartite by deleting at most $k$ of its vertices. In a breakthrough
result Reed, Smith, and Vetta (Operations Research Letters, 2004) gave a
$\BigOh(4^kkmn)$ time algorithm for it, the first algorithm with polynomial
runtime of uniform degree for every fixed $k$. It is known that this implies a
polynomial-time compression algorithm that turns OCT instances into equivalent
instances of size at most $\BigOh(4^k)$, a so-called kernelization. Since then
the existence of a polynomial kernel for OCT, i.e., a kernelization with size
bounded polynomially in $k$, has turned into one of the main open questions in
the study of kernelization.
  This work provides the first (randomized) polynomial kernelization for OCT.
We introduce a novel kernelization approach based on matroid theory, where we
encode all relevant information about a problem instance into a matroid with a
representation of size polynomial in $k$. For OCT, the matroid is built to
allow us to simulate the computation of the iterative compression step of the
algorithm of Reed, Smith, and Vetta, applied (for only one round) to an
approximate odd cycle transversal which it is aiming to shrink to size $k$. The
process is randomized with one-sided error exponentially small in $k$, where
the result can contain false positives but no false negatives, and the size
guarantee is cubic in the size of the approximate solution. Combined with an
$\BigOh(\sqrt{\log n})$-approximation (Agarwal et al., STOC 2005), we get a
reduction of the instance to size $\BigOh(k^{4.5})$, implying a randomized
polynomial kernelization.

of the single-particle oscillation-center Hamiltonians; once those are found,
the complete set of geometrical-optics equations is derived without referring
to the Maxwell-Vlasov system. The number of trapped particles is assumed fixed;
in particular, those may reside close to the bottom of the wave trapping

Also, the wave action is generally not conserved, because it can be exchanged
with resonant oscillations of the trapped-particle density. The corresponding
modification of the wave envelope equation is found explicitly, and the new

the lowest-lying uuds\bar{s} configuration with uuds subsystem of completely

with \bar{s} in P state (configuration II), which could account for the
empirical signs of all form factors G_E^s, G_M^s, and G_A^s. Further, we find
that removing the center-of-mass motion of the clusters will considerably
enhance the contributions of the transition current. We also demonstrate that
it is possible to give a reasonable description of the existing form factors
data with a tiny probability P_{s\bar{s}}=0.025% for the uuds\bar{s} component.
We further see that with a small admixture of configuration I, the agreement of
our prediction with data for G_A^s at low-q^2 region can be markedly improved.
We find that without removing CM motion, P_{s\bar{s}} would be overestimated by
about a factor of four in the case when transition current dominates. We also
explore the consequence of a recent estimate reached from analyzing existing

the ratio of the energy flux carried by trapped particles to that carried by

splitting. At $S > 1/2$, the trapped-particle modulational instability (TPMI)
develops, in contrast with the existing theories of the TPMI yet in agreement

azimuthal emission anisotropy of hadrons with low and intermediate transverse
momentum ($p_T\lesssim 4$ GeV/c) displays an intriguing scaling. In particular,
the baryon (meson) emission patterns are consistent with a scenario in which a
bulk medium of flowing quarks coalesces into three-quark (two-quark) ""bags.""
While a full understanding of this number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling
remains elusive, it is suggestive of a thermalized bulk system characterized by
colored dynamical degrees of freedom-- a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this
scenario, one expects the scaling to break down as the central energy density
is reduced below the QGP formation threshold; for this reason, NCQ-scaling
violation searches are of interest in the energy scan program at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). However, as $\roots$ is reduced, it is
not only the initial energy density that changes; there is also an increase in
the net baryon number at midrapidity, as stopping transports entrance-channel
partons to midrapidity. This phenomenon can result in violations of simple NCQ
scaling. Still in the context of the quark coalescence model, we describe a
specific pattern for the break-down of the scaling that includes different flow

sensitive X-ray polarimeters having excellent quantum efficiency while at the
same time achieving large modulation factors. To observe polarization of the
prompt X-ray emission of a Gamma-ray burst (GRB), a large area detector is
needed. Diffusion of the electron cloud in a standard TPC could be prohibitive
to measuring good modulation when the drift distance is large. Therefore, we
propose using a negative ion TPC (NITPC) with Nitromethane (CH3NO2) as the
electron capture agent. The diffusion of negative ions is reduced over that of
electrons due to the thermal coupling of the negative ions to the surrounding
gas. This allows for larger area detectors as the drift distance can be
increased without degrading polarimeter modulation. Negative ions also travel
~200 times slower than electrons, allowing the readout electronics to operate
slower, resulting in a reduction of instrument power. To optimize the NITPC
design, we have measured gas gain with SciEnergy gas electron multipliers
(GEMs) in single and double GEM configurations. Each setup was tested with
different gas combinations, concentrations and pressures: P10 700 Torr, Ne+CO2
700 Torr at varying concentrations of CO2 and Ne+CO2+CH3NO2 700 Torr. We report
gain as a function of total voltage, measured from top to bottom of the GEM
stack, and as a function of drift field strength for the gas concentrations
listed above. Examples of photoelectron tracks at 5.9 keV are also presented.

a host of research areas in astronomy and physics. Importantly, the precision
of this timing is not only affected by radiometer noise, but also by intrinsic
pulse shape changes, interstellar medium (ISM) evolution, instrumental
distortions, etc. In this paper we review the known causes of pulse shape
variations and assess their effect on the precision and accuracy of a single
measurement of pulse arrival time with current instrumentation. Throughout this
analysis we use the brightest and most precisely timed millisecond pulsar
(MSP), PSR J0437-4715, as a case study, and develop a set of diagnostic tools
to evaluate profile stability in timing observations. We conclude that most
causes of distortion can be either corrected by state-of-the-art techniques or
taken into account in the estimation of time-of-arrival (TOA) uncertainties.
The advent of a new generation of radio telescopes (e.g. the Square Kilometre
Array, SKA), and their increase in collecting area has sparked speculation
about the timing precision achievable through increases in gain. Based on our
analysis of current data, we predict that for normal-brightness MSPs a TOA
precision of between 80 and 230 ns can be achieved at 1.4 GHz with 10-minute
integrations by the SKA. The actual rms timing residuals for each pulsar will
be approximately at the same level only if all the other influences on timing
precision (e.g. ISM, spin noise) are either corrected, modelled, or negligible.

information and queueing theory. Unlike classical, equilibrium information
theory, information envelopes focus on the dynamics of sources and coders,
using functions of time that bound the number of bits generated. In the limit
the information envelopes converge to the average behavior and recover the
entropy of a source, respectively, the average codeword length of a coder. In
contrast, on short time scales and for sources with memory it is shown that
large deviations from known equilibrium results occur with non-negligible
probability. These can cause significant network delays. Compared to well-known
traffic models from queueing theory, information envelopes consider the
functioning of information sources and coders, avoiding a priori assumptions,
such as exponential traffic, or empirical, trace-based traffic models. Using
results from the stochastic network calculus, the envelopes yield a
characterization of the operating points of source coders by the triplet of
capacity, delay, and error. In the limit, assuming an optimal coder the
required capacity approaches the entropy with arbitrarily small probability of
error if infinitely large delays are permitted. We derive a corresponding
characterization of channels and prove that the model has the desirable
property of additivity, that allows analyzing coders and channels separately.
