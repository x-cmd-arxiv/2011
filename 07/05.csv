scalar field with a quartic coupling, driven by a classical source that
initializes it to a non-perturbatively large value. At leading order in the
coupling, the evolution of this system is given by classical solutions of the
field equation of motion. However, this system is subject to a parametric
resonance that leads to secular divergences in higher order corrections to
physical observables. We have proposed a scheme that resums all the leading
secular terms: this resummation leads to finite results at all times, and we
have observed also that it makes the pressure tensor of the system relax to its
equilibrium value.
  In the present paper, we continue the study of this system by looking at
finer details of its dynamics. We first compute its spectral function at
various stages of the evolution, and we observe that after a fairly short
transient time there are well defined massive quasi-particles. We then consider
the time evolution of the momentum distribution of these quasi-particles, and
we show that after a stage dominated by the parametric resonance, this
distribution slowly evolves to an equilibrium distribution. Interestingly, this
distribution develops a transient chemical potential, signalling the fact that
number changing processes are much slower than the elastic ones.

compact binary system, as encoded in the Love number associated with the
induced deformation. This problem is of interest for gravitational-wave
astronomy as there may be a detectable imprint on the signal from the late
stages of binary coalescence. Previous work has focussed on simple barotropic
neutron star models, providing an understanding of the role of the stellar
compactness and overall density profile. We add realism to the discussion by
developing the framework required to model stars with varying composition and
an elastic crust. These effects are not expected to be significant for the next
generation of detectors but it is nevertheless useful to be able to quantify
them. Our results show that (perhaps surprisingly) internal stratification has
no impact whatsoever on the Love number. We also show that crust elasticity
provides a (predictably) small correction to existing models.

below the Neel transition, the topology of the reconstructed Fermi surface,
combined with the distinct behavior of the scattering rates, determines the
anisotropy of the low frequency optical response. For the itinerant charge
carriers, we are able to disentangle the evolution of the Drude weights and
scattering rates and to observe their enhancement along the orthorhombic
antiferromagnetic a-axis with respect to the ferromagnetic b-axis. For
temperatures above Ts, uniaxial stress leads to a finite in-plane anisotropy.
The anisotropy of the optical conductivity, leading to a significant dichroism,
extends to high frequencies in the mid- and near-infrared regions. The
temperature dependence of the dichroism at all dopings scales with the
anisotropy ratio of the dc conductivity, suggesting the electronic nature of
the structural transition. Our findings bear testimony to a large nematic
susceptibility that couples very effectively to the uniaxial lattice strain. In

we compare our results with theoretical calculations obtained from density

""experimentalist - friendly"" self-consistent Eilenberger model that relates the
measurable superfluid density and structure of superconducting gaps. Then we
focus on the \BaFe -derived materials, for which the results are consistent
with 1) two distinct superconducting gaps; 2) development of strong in-plane
gap anisotropy with the departure from the optimal doping; 3) appearance of gap
nodes along the $c-$direction in a highly overdoped regime; 4) significant
pair-breaking, presumably due to charge doping; 5) fully gapped (exponential)
intrinsic behavior at the optimal doping if scattering is removed (probed in
the ""self-doped"" stoichiometric LiFeAs); 6) competition between magnetically
ordered state and superconductivity, which do coexist in the underdoped
compounds. Overall, it appears that while there are common trends in the
behavior of Fe-based superconductors, the gap structure is non-universal and is
sensitive to the doping level. It is plausible that the rich variety of
possible gap structures within the general $s_{\pm}$ framework is responsible
for the observed behavior.

galactic nuclei are surrounded by a clumpy torus. We investigate the NIR flux
variation of the torus in response to a UV flash for various geometries.
Anisotropic illumination by the disk and the torus self-occultation contrast
our study with earlier works. Both the waning effect of each clump and the
torus self-occultation selectively reduce the emission from the region with a
short delay. Therefore, the NIR delay depends on the viewing angle (where a
more inclined angle leads to a longer delay) and the time response shows an
asymmetric profile with a negative skewness, opposing to the results for
optically thin tori. The range of the computed delay coincides with the
observed one, suggesting that the viewing angle is primarily responsible for
the scatter of the observed delay. We also propose that the red NIR-to-optical
color of type-1.8/1.9 objects is caused by not only the dust extinction but
also the intrinsically red color. Compared with the modest torus thickness,
both a thick and a thin tori display the weaker NIR emission. A selection bias
is thus expected such that NIR-selected AGNs tend to possess moderately thick
tori. A thicker torus shows a narrower and more heavily skewed time profile,
while a thin torus produces a rapid response. A super-Eddington accretion rate
leads to a much weaker NIR emission due to the disk self-occultation and the
disk truncation by the self-gravity. A long delay is expected from an optically
thin and/or a largely misaligned torus. A very weak NIR emission, such as in
hot-dust-poor active nuclei, can arise from a geometrically thin torus, a
super-Eddington accretion rate or a slightly misaligned torus.

between the spatial morphology of the radio and mid-IR maps indicate the
existence of two dust populations, the cooler one emitting mostly at longer
wavelengths. Analysis of the two dusty, nested shells have provided us with an
estimate of the characteristic timescales for shell ejection, providing
important constraints for stellar evolutionary models. Finer details of the
ionized gas distribution can be appreciated thanks to the improved quality of
the new 6 cm image, most notably the highly structured texture of the nebula.
Evidence of interaction between the nebula and the surrounding interstellar

This
representation was used to derive equations for massive interacting fermion

vector and axial currents irrespective of the fermion mass value. In the Dirac
representation, the axial current is preserved only for massless fermions. In
the isotopic Foldy-Wouthuysen representation, the ground state of fermions
(vacuum) turns out to be degenerate, and therefore there is the possibility of
spontaneously breaking parity (P - symmetry). This study considers the example
of constructing a chirally symmetric quantum electrodynamics framework in the
isotopic Foldy-Wouthuysen representation. A number of physical processes are
calculated in the lowest orders of the perturbation theory. Final results of
the calculations agree with the results of the standard quantum

\Delta_{SC} in Y-123 and \Delta_{PG} < \Delta_{SC} in La-112, suggesting that
the physical origin of \Delta_{PG} is a competing order coexisting with
superconductivity. Additionally, Fourier transformation (FT) of the Y-123
spectra exhibits two types of spectral peaks, one type is associated with
energy (\omega)-dependent quasiparticle interference (QPI) wave-vectors and the
other consists of \omega-independent wave-vectors due to competing orders and
(\pi,\pi) magnetic resonances. For the multi-band Co-122 compounds, two-gap
superconductivity is found for all doping levels. Magnetic resonant modes that
follow the temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps are also
identified. These findings, together with the \omega- and x-dependent QPI
spectra, are consistent with a sign-changing s-wave pairing symmetry in the
Co-122 iron arsenides. Our comparative studies suggest that the commonalities
among the cuprate and the ferrous superconductors include the proximity to
competing orders, antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations and magnetic
resonances in the superconducting (SC) state, and the unconventional pairing
symmetries with sign-changing order parameters on different parts of the Fermi

and (MO)MFBD techniques. We compare the spatial resolution and investigate the
impact of the reconstruction on spectral characteristics. The speckle
reconstruction and MFBD perform similar for our imaging data with nearly
identical intensity contrasts. MFBD provides a better and more homogeneous
resolution at the shortest wavelength. The MOMFBD and speckle deconvolution of
the intensity spectra lead to similar results, but our choice of settings for
the MOMFBD yields an intensity contrast smaller by about 2% at a comparable
spatial resolution. None of the reconstruction techniques introduces artifacts
in the intensity spectra. The speckle deconvolution (MOMFBD) has a rms noise in
V/I of 0.32% (0.20%). The deconvolved spectra thus require a high significance
threshold of about 1.0%. A comparison to spectra with a significantly higher
S/N ratio and to spectra from a MHD simulation reveals that the Goettingen FPI
can only detect about 30% of the polarization signal in quiet Sun. The
distribution of NCP values for the speckle-deconvolved data matches that of
observations with higher S/N better than MOMFBD, but shows seemingly
artificially sharp boundaries and unexpected changes of the sign. For the
spectropolarimetric data, the higher intensity contrast of the speckle
deconvolution is balanced by the smaller amplification of the noise level in
the MOMFBD at a comparable spatial resolution. The noise level prevents the
detection of weak and diffuse magnetic fields.

These observations are phase-referenced to the supernova SN1993J (located in
the same galaxy) and cover from late 1993 to late 2005. The source consists at
all frequencies of a slightly resolved core and a small jet extension towards
the north-east direction (position angle of ~65 degrees) in agreement with
previous publications. We find that the position of the intensity peak in the
images at 8.4GHz is very stable in the galactic frame of M81 (proper motion
upper limit about 0.010 mas per year). We confirm previous reports that the
peaks at all frequencies are systematically shifted among them, possibly due to
opacity effects in the jet as predicted by the standard relativistic jet model.
We use this model to estimate the magnetic field in the jet and the mass of the
central black hole. We obtain a black-hole mass of ~2.e+7 solar masses,
comparable to estimates previously reported, but the magnetic fields obtained
are thousands of times lower than previous estimates. We find that the
positions of the cores at 1.7, 2.3, and 5GHz are less stable than that at
8.4GHz and evolve systematically, shifting southward at a rate of several tens
of micro-arcsec per year. The evolution in the jet orientation seems to be
related to changes in the inclination of the cores at all frequencies. These
results can be interpreted as due to a precessing jet. The jet precession also
seems to be related to a flare in the flux densities at 5.0 and 8.4GHz, which
lasts ~4 years. A continued monitoring of the flux density and the jet
structure evolution in this LLAGN will be necessary to further confirm our jet
precession model.

rules out massive gravity. Here we find that the solution itself is rather
unphysical. For this we show that there is another mode on the same background
which grows and overcomes the background in an arbitrarily short period of
time, that can be excited by a negligible cost in energy. This solution is
triggered by the parameter governing the superluminality. Furthermore, we also
show that the solution, if viewed as a perfect fluid, has no rest frame, or
that the Lorentz transformation that is needed to boost to the rest frame is
superluminal itself. The stress-tensor of this fluid has complex eigenvalues,
and could not be obtained from any physically sensible matter. Moreover, for
the same setup we find another background solution, fluctuations of which are
all stable and subluminal. Based on these results, we conclude that the
superluminality found in arXiv:1106.3972 is an artifact of using an
inappropriate background, nevertheless, this solution represents an instructive
example for understanding massive gravity. For instance, on this background the
Boulware-Deser ghost is absent, even though this may naively appear not to be

quasiparticles. We allow for the leptons to be either decoupled from each
other, except for the interactions with neutrinos, or to be in chemical
equilibrium by some strong interaction, for example via gauge bosons. In two
additional cases, we approximate the full hard-thermal-loop lepton propagators
with zero-temperature propagators, where we replace the zero-temperature mass
by the thermal mass of the leptons $m_\ell(T)$ in one case and the asymptotic
mass of the positive-helicity mode $\sqrt{2} \, m_\ell(T)$ in the other case.
We calculate all relevant decay rates and $\CP$-asymmetries and solve the
corresponding Boltzmann equations we derived. We compare the final lepton
asymmetry of the four thermal cases and the vacuum case for three different
initial neutrino abundances; zero, thermal and dominant abundance. The final
asymmetries of the thermal cases differ considerably from the vacuum case and
from each other in the weak washout regime for zero abundance and in the
intermediate regime for dominant abundance. In the strong washout regime, where
no influences from thermal corrections are commonly expected, the final lepton
asymmetry can be enhanced by a factor of two by hiding part of the lepton
asymmetry in the quasi-sterile minus-mode in the case of strongly interacting

depart from the linear fit to observed data, displaying almost constant
colours. We analyze the dependence with redshift of the fraction of stellar
mass contributed to each galaxy by different processes (i.e., quiescent star
formation, disc instability and mergers), finding that the evolution of the
bright end, since $z\approx 2$, is mainly driven by minor and major dry
mergers. Since the most luminous galaxies have a narrow spread in ages
($1.0\times 10^{10}$ yr $<t<1.2\times 10^{10}$ yr), their metallicities are the
main factor that affects their colours. Galaxies in the bright end reach an
upper limit in metallicity as a result of the competition of the mass of stars
and metals provided by the star formation within the galaxies and by the
accretion of merging satellites. Star formation activity in massive galaxies
(M_\star \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) contribute with stellar components of high
metallicity, but this fraction of stellar mass is negligible. Mergers
contribute with a larger fraction of stellar mass ($\approx 10-20$ per cent),
but the metallicity of the accreted satellites is lower by $\approx 0.2$ dex
than the mean metallicity of galaxies they merge with. The effect of dry
mergers is to increase the mass of galaxies in the bright end, without
significantly altering their metallicities, and hence,their colours, giving
rise to the break in the RS. These results are found for clusters with
different virial masses, supporting the idea of the universality of the CMR in

the information that in contained in galaxy surveys, so as to find optimal ways
to combine observables from such surveys. We first show how Jaynes' Maximal
Entropy Principle allows us, in the general case, to express the Fisher
information content of data sets in terms of the curvature of the Shannon
entropy surface with respect to the relevant observables. This allows us to
understand the Fisher information content of a data set, once a physical model
is specified, independently of the specific way that the data will be
processed, and without any assumptions of Gaussianity. This includes as a
special case the standard Fisher matrix prescriptions for Gaussian variables
widely used in the cosmological community, for instance for power spectra
extraction. As an application of this approach, we evaluate the prospects of a
joint analysis of weak lensing tracers up to second order in the shapes
distortions, in the case that the noise in each probe can be effectively
treated as model independent. These include the magnification, the two
ellipticity and the four flexion fields. At the two point level, we show that
the only effect of treating these observables in combination is a simple scale
dependent decrease of the noise contaminating the accessible spectrum of the
lensing E-mode. We provide simple bounds to its extraction by a combination of
such probes, as well as its quantitative evaluation when the correlations
between the noise variables for any two such probes can be neglected.

stellar or sub-stellar companions. The formation and survival of these
fragments depends on the precarious balance between self-gravity, internal
pressure, tidal shearing, and rotation. Disk fragmentation depends on two key
factors (1) whether the disk can get to the fragmentation boundary of Q=1, and
(2) whether fragments can survive for many orbital periods. Previous work
suggests that to reach Q=1, and have fragments survive, a disk must cool on an
orbital timescale. Here we show that disks heated primarily by external
irradiation always satisfy the standard cooling time criterion. Thus even
though irradiation heats disks, and makes them more stable in general, once
they reach the fragmentation boundary, they fragment more easily. We derive a
new cooling criterion that determines fragment survival, and calculate a
pressure modified Hill radius, which sets the maximum size of
pressure-supported objects in a Keplerian disk. We conclude that fragmentation
in protostellar disks might occur at slightly smaller radii than previously
thought, and recommend tests for future simulations that will better predict
the outcome of fragmentation in real disks.

examples taken from the astrophysics and cosmology world: baryonic acoustic
oscillations, cosmic clocks, Supernova Type Ia luminosity distance, neutrino
oscillations and dark matter detection. By applying the method we recover some
known results but also find some interesting new ones. For baryonic acoustic
oscillation (BAO) experiments we show how to combine radial and angular BAO
measurements in order to completely eliminate the dependence on the sound
horizon at radiation drag. In the case of exploiting SN1a as standard candles
we show how the uncertainty in the luminosity distance by a second parameter
modeled as a metallicity dependence can be eliminated or greatly reduced. When
using cosmic clocks to measure the expansion rate of the universe, we
demonstrate how a particular combination of observables nearly removes the
metallicity dependence of the galaxy on determining differential ages, thus
removing the age-metallicity degeneracy in stellar populations. We hope that
these findings will be useful in future surveys to obtain robust constraints on

equations of motion in a vectorial formalism which is suitable to model the
long-term evolution of a large variety of exoplanetary systems in very
eccentric and inclined orbits. In particular, it can be used to derive
constraints for stellar spin-orbit misalignment, capture in Cassini states,
tidal-Kozai migration, or damping of the mutual inclination. Because our model
is valid for the non-restricted problem, it can be used to study systems of
identical mass or for the outer restricted problem, such as the evolution of a
planet around a binary of stars. Here, we apply our model to three distinct
situations: 1) the HD80606 planetary system, for which we obtain the
probability density function distribution for the misalignment angle, with two
pronounced peaks of higher probability around 53 and 109 degrees; 2) the

the observed disc may become retrograde and vice-versa, only because of tidal
migration within the binary stars; 3) the HD11964 planetary system, for which

neutrino mass but at the cost of introducing right-handed neutrinos at a scale
that is out of range for the current experiments. The inverse see-saw mechanism
is an interesting alternative to the canonical one once it leads to tiny
neutrino masses with the advantage of being testable at TeV scale. However,
this last mechanism suffers from an issue of naturalness concerning the scale
responsible for such small masses, namely, the parameter $\mu$ that is related
to lepton number violation and is supposed to be at the keV scale, much lower
than the electroweak one. However, no theoretical framework was built that
offers an explanation for obtaining this specific scale. In this work we
propose a variation of the inverse see-saw mechanism by assuming a minimal
scalar and fermionic set of singlet fields, along with a $Z_5\otimes Z_2$
symmetry, that allows a dynamical explanation for the smallness of $\mu$,
recovering the neat canonical see-saw formula and with right-handed (RH)
neutrinos free to be at the electroweak scale, thus testable at LHC and current

Such quantities are central to the definition of both the model of systems

the analysis and verification of the systems properties. The aim of this

time and probabilities either directly in the model or as a tool for the

of the shock structure and particle acceleration efficiency as a function of
Alfv\'enic Mach number and magnetic field inclination angle $\theta$. We show
that there are fundamental differences between high and low Mach number shocks
in terms of the electromagnetic turbulence generated in the pre-shock zone and
downstream; dominant modes are resonant with the streaming CRs in the low Mach
number regime, while both resonant and non-resonant modes are present for high
Mach numbers. Energetic power law tails for ions in the downstream plasma can
account for up to 15% of the incoming upstream flow energy, distributed over
$\sim5%$ of the particles in a power law with slope $-2\pm0.2$ in energy. The
energy conversion efficiency (for CRs) peaks at $\theta=15^\circ$ to $30^\circ$
and $M_A=6$, and decreases for higher Mach numbers, down to $\sim2%$ for
$M_A=31$. Accelerated particles are produced by Diffusive Shock Acceleration
(DSA) and by Shock Drift Acceleration (SDA) mechanisms, with the SDA
contribution to the overall energy gain increasing with magnetic inclination.
We also present a direct comparison between hybrid and fully kinetic
particle-in-cell results at early times; the agreement between the two models
justifies the use of hybrid simulations for longer-term shock evolution. In SNR
shocks, particle acceleration will be significant for low Mach number
quasi-parallel flows ($M_A < 30$, $\theta< 45$). This finding underscores the

investigated further in a class of model nonlinear scalar field theories having
a perturbative structure analogous to the General Relativistic description of
extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We derive regular expressions for the
scalar perturbations generated by the SCO's motion valid through third order in
$\epsilon$, the size of the SCO to the background curvature length scale. Our
expressions are compared to those calculated through second order in $\epsilon$
by Rosenthal in [E. Rosenthal, CQG 22, S859 (2005)] and found to agree but our
procedure for regularizing the scalar perturbations is considerably simpler.
Following the Detweiler-Whiting (DW) scheme, we use our regular expressions for
the field and derive the regular self-force corrections through third order. We
find agreement with our previous derivation based on a variational principle of
an effective action for the worldline associated with the SCO thus
demonstrating the internal consistency of our formalism. This also explicitly
demonstrates that the DW decomposition of Green's functions is a valid and
practical method of self force computation at higher orders in perturbation
theory and, as we show in an appendix, at all orders in perturbation theory.
Finally, we identify a master source from which all other physically relevant
quantities are derivable. Knowing the master source perturbatively allows one
to construct the waveform measured by an observer, the regular part of the
field on the worldline, the regular part of the self force, and orbital
quantities such as shifts of the innermost stable circular orbit, etc. The
existence of a master source together with the regularization methods

stronger when the stellar models are located upper and upper along the Hayashi
line. In the convective unstable zone, we find that the turbulent correlations
are proportional to functions of a common factor $(\nabla-\nabla_{ad})\bar{T}$,
which explains similar distributions of those correlations. For the TCM we find
that if the obtained stellar structure of temperature is close to that of the
MLT, the convective motion will be at a much larger velocity and thus more
violent. However, if the turbulent velocity is adjusted to close to that of the
MLT, the superadiabatic convection zone is much more extended inward and a
lower effective temperature of the stellar model will be obtained. For the
overshooting distance we find that the e-folding lengths of the turbulent
kinetic energy k in both the top and bottom overshooting regions decrease as
the stellar model is located up along the Hayashi line, but both the extents of
the decrease are not obvious. And the overshooting distances of the turbulent

two wide brown dwarf binaries uncovered by the SIMP near-infrared proper motion
survey. The first pair (SIMP J1619275+031350AB) has a separation of 0.691""
(15.2 AU) and components T2.5+T4.0, at the cooler end of the ill-understood
J-band brightening. The system is unusual in that the earlier-type primary is
bluer in J-Ks than the later-type secondary, whereas the reverse is expected
for binaries in the late-L to T dwarf range. This remarkable color reversal can
possibly be explained by very different cloud properties between the two
components. The second pair (SIMP J1501530-013506AB) consists of an L4.5+L5.5
(separation 0.96"", 30-47 AU) with a surprisingly large flux ratio (Delta J
=1.79 mag) considering the similar spectral types of its components. The large
flux ratio could be explained if the primary is itself an equal-luminosity
binary, which would make it one of the first known triple brown dwarf systems.
Adaptive optics observations could not confirm this hypothesis, but it remains
a likely one, which may be verified by high-resolution near-infrared
spectroscopy. These two systems add to the handful of known brown dwarf
binaries amenable to resolved spectroscopy without the aid of adaptive optics
and constitute prime targets to test brown dwarf atmosphere models.

rotation variability of HST-1 in the M87 jet during the outburst from 2003 to
2007 through multi-epoch VLA observations at 8, 15, and 22 GHz. Contrary to the
general case for blazars, the flux densities of HST-1 rise earlier at lower
frequencies from radio to X-ray, and the spectra are softening with the growth
of outburst, indicating that the newly emerging subcomponents within HST-1 have
relatively steep spectra. In particular, the intrinsic EVPA varies
monotonically by $\sim90^\circ$ at the 3 wavebands during the period, and all
but the stationary subcomponent in the eastern end of HST-1 move downstream
superluminally deviating divergently from the overall jet direction, with the
motion of the outmost subcomponent bending from one side of the jet axis to
another. These strongly argue for the presence of helical magnetic fields
around HST-1, which is also supported by the fact that the subcomponents might
be accelerated in this region. The fractional polarization is relatively low in
the rising stage, and in the decaying stage the polarization levels are almost
comparable at the 3 wavebands. In view of the quite large RM values, Faraday
rotation is expected to occur dominantly external to HST-1 in the decaying
stage, which is well supported by the presence of diffuse emission around
HST-1, and consistent with the scenario that RM decrease gets slower with time.

longstanding campaigns following events discovered at other wavelengths. After
~ 30 years of observations, only ~ 50 supernovae have been detected at radio
wavelengths, none of which are Type Ia. Even the most radio-loud events are ~
10^4 fainter in the radio than in the optical; to date, such intrinsically dim
objects have only been visible in the very local universe. The detection and
study of radio supernovae (RSNe) will be fundamentally altered and dramatically
improved as the next generation of radio telescopes comes online, including
EVLA, ASKAP, and MeerKAT, and culminating in the Square Kilometer Array (SKA);
the latter should be > 50 times more sensitive than present facilities. SKA can
repeatedly scan large (> 1 deg^2) areas of the sky, and thus will discover RSNe
and other transient sources in a new, automatic, untargeted, and unbiased way.
We estimate SKA will be able to detect core-collapse RSNe out to redshift z ~
5, with an all-redshift rate ~ 620 events yr^-1 deg^-2, assuming a survey
sensitivity of 50 nJy and radio lightcurves like those of SN 1993J. Hence SKA
should provide a complete core-collapse RSN sample that is sufficient for
statistical studies of radio properties of core-collapse supernovae. EVLA
should find ~ 160 events yr^-1 deg^-2 out to redshift z ~ 3, and other SKA
precursors should have similar detection rates. We also provided
recommendations of the survey strategy to maximize the RSN detections of SKA.
This new radio core-collapse supernovae sample will complement the detections
from the optical searches, such as the LSST, and together provide crucial
information on massive star evolution, supernova physics, and the circumstellar
medium, out to high redshift. Additionally, SKA may yield the first radio Type
Ia detection via follow-up of nearby events discovered at other wavelengths.

inefficient, subjects are risk-seeking at low satisfaction levels, consistent
with risk-sensitive foraging theory in ecology. It is further suggested that
some anomalies in decision under risk are due to inefficiency of the coupling

algorithms into practical use, we suggest taking samples that are entire
low-dimensional manifolds of the configuration space that capture the
connectivity of the configuration space much better than isolated point
samples. Geometric algorithms for analysis of low-dimensional manifolds then
provide powerful primitive operations. The modular design of the framework
enables independent optimization of each modular component. Indeed, we have
developed, implemented and optimized a primitive operation for complete and
exact combinatorial analysis of a certain set of manifolds, using arrangements
of curves of rational functions and concepts of generic programming. This in
turn enabled us to implement our framework for the concrete case of a polygonal
robot translating and rotating amidst polygonal obstacles. We demonstrate that
the integration of several carefully engineered components leads to significant
speedup over the popular PRM sampling-based algorithm, which represents the
more simplistic approach that is prevalent in practice. We foresee possible

The mixed phase is inhomogeneous matter composed of two phases in equilibrium;
it takes a crystalline structure with a unit of various geometrical shapes,
inside of which one phase with a characteristic shape, called ""pasta"", is
embedded in another phase by some volume fraction. This framework enables us to
properly take into account the Coulomb interaction and the interface energy,

structures of the mixed phase. Thermal effect on the liquid-gas phase
transition is also elucidated.

effective method of investigating index problems in geometries that are
genuinely noncommutative, particularly in the nonunital situation, was a
primary motivation for this study and we illustrate this point with two

we prove an analogue of the Gromov-Lawson relative index formula (for Dirac

invoking compact supports. For odd dimensional manifolds our index formula
appears to be completely new. As we prove our local index formula in the
framework of semifinite noncommutative geometry we are also able to prove, for

covering spaces. We also explain how to interpret the McKean-Singer formula in

self-gravitating disc fragmentation need to be able to predict the initial
masses of fragments. We describe a means by which the local Jeans mass inside
the spiral structure of a self-gravitating disc can be estimated. If such a
self-gravitating disc satisfies the criteria for disc fragmentation, this
estimate provides a lower limit for the initial mass of any fragments formed.
We apply this approach to a series of self-gravitating protostellar disc
models, to map out the typical masses of fragments produced by this formation
mode. We find a minimum fragment mass of around 3 Jupiter masses, which is
insensitive to the stellar mass, and that - within the parameter space surveyed
- fragments with masses between 10 and 20 Jupiter masses are the most common.
We also describe how the Jeans mass allows us to derive a more general
criterion for disc fragmentation, which accounts for the processes of viscous
heating, radiative cooling, accretion and the disc's thermal history. We
demonstrate how such a criterion can be determined, and show that in limiting
cases it recovers several fragmentation criteria that have been posited in the
past, including the minimum cooling time/maximum stress criterion.

matter has not been confirmed due to the lack of both theoretical and
experimental evidence. Motivated by recent lattice QCD simulations of the
H-dibaryons (with structure uuddss), we are therefore considering here a
possible kind of quark-clusters, H-clusters, that could emerge inside compact
stars during their initial cooling, as the dominant components inside (the
degree of freedom could then be H-clusters there).Taking into account the
in-medium stiffening effect, we find that at baryon densities of compact stars
$H$-cluster matter could be more stable than nuclear matter. We also find that
for the H-cluster matter with lattice structure, the equation of state could be
so stiff that it would seem to be ""superluminal"" in most dense region. However,
the real sound speed for H-cluster matter is in fact hard to calculate, so at
this stage we do not put constraints on our model from the usual requirment of
causality.

provides additional information about the concentration of stock gains over

explain the investors' behavior during the bubble generation. We apply this new
model to two famous Chinese stock bubbles, from August 2006 to October 2007

found highly significant for bubble 1, corresponding to the fact that valuation
gains were more concentrated on the large firms of the Shanghai index. It is
likely that the widespread acknowledgement of the 80-20 rule in the Chinese
media and discussion forums led many investors to discount the risk of a lack
of diversification, therefore enhancing the role of the Zipf factor. For bubble
2, the Zipf factor is found marginally relevant, suggesting a larger weight of
market gains on small firms. We interpret this result as the consequence of the
response of the Chinese economy to the very large stimulus provided by the

The main focus of the study is on the properties of gold-promoted titania

demonstrated that the diffusion of Au adatoms on the stoichiometric surface is
highly anisotropic. The metal atoms migrate either along the top of the
bridging oxygen rows, or around the area between these rows, from one bridging
position to the next along the [001] direction. Approximate ab initio

problem orbits is established, and then the orbits $k$ themselves are shown to
be conic sections using the fact that $k$ is the polar reciprocal of $k_*$. A
geometrical construction is presented for the orbits of the Kepler problem

coherent state orbits are introduced as sub-manifolds of the quantum state
space, with the K\""ahler structure induced by the transition probability. The
time dependent variational principle (TDVP) is applied on coherent states'
orbits. The Hamilton equations of motion on K\""ahler manifolds of the type of
classical phase spaces naturally arise. The associated classical Hamiltonian is
obtained from the expected values on symplectic coherent states of the quantum
Hamiltonian. Spectral information is thus coded within the phase portrait. We
deal with the bosonic realization of the Lie algebra of the SU(1,1) group,
which we particularize for the case of an ion confined in a combined, Paul and
Penning trap. This formalism can be applied to Hamiltonians which are nonlinear
in the infinitesimal generators of a dynamical symmetry group, such as the case
of ions confined in electrodynamic traps. Discrete quasienergy spectra are
obtained and the corresponding quasienergy states are explicitly realized as
coherent states parameterized by the stable solutions of the corresponding
classical equations of motion. A correspondence between quantum and classical
stability domains is thus established, using the Husimi representation.

the completeness in apparent magnitude of magnitude-redshift surveys. The
purpose of this third and final paper in our completeness series is two-fold:
firstly we explore how certain forms of incompleteness for a given flux-limited
galaxy redshift survey would manifest themselves in the ROBUST Tc and Tv
completeness estimators introduced in our earlier papers; secondly we provide a
comprehensive error propagation for these estimators. By using both real
surveys and Monte Carlo mock survey data, we have found distinct,
characteristic behaviour of the Tc and Tv estimators which identify
incompleteness in the form of e.g. missing objects within a particular
magnitude range. Conversely we have identified signatures of `over'
completeness, in cases where a survey contains a small region in apparent
magnitude that may have too many objects relative to the rest of the data set.
We also demonstrate how incompleteness resulting from luminosity evolution can
be identified and provide a framework for using our estimators as a robust tool
for constraining models of luminosity evolution.
  Finally we explore the error propagation for Tc andTv. This builds on
Completeness II by allowing the definition of these estimators, and their
errors, via an adaptive procedure that accounts for the effects of sampling
error on the observed distribution of apparent magnitude and redshift in a
survey.

an exact Monte Carlo treatment of global Comptonization, with seed photons from
synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, as well as with a fully general
relativistic description of both the radiative and hydrodynamic processes. We
consider accretion rates for which the luminosities of the flows are between
~0.001 and 0.01 of the Eddington luminosity. The black hole spin parameter
strongly affects the flow structure within the innermost 10 gravitational
radii. The resulting large difference between the Coulomb heating in models
with a non-rotating and a rapidly rotating black hole is, however, outweighed
by a strong contribution of compression work, much less dependent on spin. The
consequent reduction of effects related to the value of the black spin is more
significant at smaller accretion rates. For a non-rotating black hole, the
compressive heating of electrons dominates over their Coulomb heating, and
results in an approximately constant radiative efficiency of approximately 0.4
per cent in the considered range of luminosities. For a rapidly rotating black
hole, the Coulomb heating dominates, the radiative efficiency is ~1 per cent
and it slightly increases (but less significantly than estimated in some
previous works) with increasing accretion rate. We find an agreement between
our model, in which the synchrotron emission is the main source of seed
photons, and observations of black-hole binaries in their hard states and AGNs
at low luminosities. In particular, our model predicts a hardening of the X-ray
spectrum with increasing luminosity, as indeed observed below ~0.01 of the
Eddington luminosity in both black-hole binaries and AGNs. Also, our model
approximately reproduces the luminosity and the slope of the X-ray emission in
Cen A.

Our algorithm is of combinatorial nature. It is based on a rather simple

theory is described by a DBI action of double fields. The T-duality covariant
form of this DBI action is thus a kind of ""master"" action, which describes all
the double D-brane configurations related by T-duality transformations. We
discuss a number of aspects of this effective theory.

Submitted to AIP: Physics of Plasmas",,"10.1063/1.3695014",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  In the present paper the transport of impurities driven by trapped electron
(TE) mode turbulence is studied. Non-linear (NL) gyrokinetic simulations using
the code GENE are compared with results from quasilinear (QL) gyrokinetic
simulations and a computationally efficient fluid model. The main focus is on
model comparisons for electron temperature gra- dient driven turbulence
regarding the sign of the convective impurity velocity (pinch) and the impurity
density gradient R/LnZ (peaking factor) for zero impurity flux. In particular,
the scaling of the impurity peaking factors with impurity charge Z and with
driving temper- ature gradient is investigated and compared with the results
for Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven turbulence. In addition, the impurity
peaking is compared to the main ion peaking obtained by a self-consistent fluid
calculation of the density gradients corresponding to zero particle fluxes.
  For the scaling of the peaking factor with impurity charge Z, a weak
dependence is obtained from NL GENE and fluid simulations. The QL GENE results
show a stronger dependence for low Z impurities and overestimates the peaking
factor by up to a factor of two in this region. As in the case of ITG dominated
turbulence, the peaking factors saturate as Z increases, at a level much below
neoclassical predictions. However, the scaling with Z is weak or reversed as
compared to the ITG case.
  The scaling of impurity peaking with the background temperature gradients is
found to be weak in the NL GENE and fluid simulations. The QL results are also
here found to significantly overestimate the peaking factor for low Z values.
  For the parameters considered, the background density gradient for zero
particle flux is found to be slightly larger than the corresponding impurity
zero flux gradient.

been studied over the rotation cycle. During the past two years we have
obtained multi-epoch polarimetric spectra of the beta Cephei star V1449 Aql
with SOFIN at the Nordic Optical Telescope to search for a rotation period and
to constrain the geometry of the magnetic field.
  The mean longitudinal magnetic field is measured at 13 different epochs. The
new measurements, together with the previous FORS1 measurements, have been used
for the frequency analysis and the characterization of the magnetic field.
  V1449 Aql so far possesses the strongest longitudinal magnetic field of up to
700G among the beta Cephei stars. The resulting periodogram displays three
dominant peaks with the highest peak at f=0.0720d^-1 corresponding to a period
P=13.893d. The magnetic field geometry can likely be described by a centred
dipole with a polar magnetic field strength B_d around 3kG and an inclination
angle beta of the magnetic axis to the rotation axis of 76+-4deg. As of today,
the strongest longitudinal magnetic fields are detected in the beta Cephei
stars V1449 Aql and xi^1 CMa with large radial velocity amplitudes. Their
peak-to-peak amplitudes reach ~90km/s and ~33km/s, respectively. Concluding, we
briefly discuss the position of the currently known eight magnetic beta Cephei
and candidate beta Cephei stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram.

potential that grows logarithmically for large $|x|$ using the Fokker-Planck

  An eigenfunction expansion shows that the Boltzmann equilibrium density does
not fully describe the long time limit of this problem. Instead this limit is
characterized by an infinite covariant density. This non-normalizable density
yields the mean square displacement of the particles, which for a certain range
of parameters exhibits anomalous diffusion. In a symmetric potential with an
asymmetric initial condition, the average position decays anomalously slowly.
This problem also has applications outside the thermal context, as in the

formation in protocluster clumps of different metallicities. In this model,
gravitationally bound cores form uniformly in the clump following a prescribed
core formation efficiency per unit time. After a contraction timescale which is
equal to a few times their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and
populate the IMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account
in the form of stellar winds. When the ratio of the effective wind energy of
the winds to the gravitational energy of the system reaches unity, gas is
removed from the clump and core and star formation are quenched. The power of
the radiation driven winds has a strong dependence on metallicity and increases
with increasing metallicity. Thus, winds from stars in the high metallicity
models lead to a rapid evacuation of the gas from the protocluster clump and to
a reduced star formation efficiency, SFE_{exp}, as compared to their low
metallicity counterparts. By combining SFE_{exp} with the timescales on which
gas expulsion occurs, we derive the metallicity dependent star formation rate
per unit time in this model as a function of the gas surface density Sigma_{g}.
This is combined with the molecular gas fraction in order to derive the
dependence of the surface density of star formation Sigma_{SFR} on Sigma_{g}.
This feedback regulated model of star formation reproduces very well the
observed star formation laws extending from low gas surface densities up to the
starburst regime. Furthermore, the results show a dependence of Sigma_{SFR} on
metallicity over the entire range of gas surface densities, and can also
explain part of the scatter in the observations.

structural property of a given problem when discretising this problem.
Precisely we are interested with Lagrangian or Hamiltonian structures and thus
with variational problems attached to a least action principle. Considering a
partial differential equation (PDE) deriving from such a variational principle,
a natural question is to know whether this structure at the continuous level is
preserved at the discrete level when discretising the PDE. To address this
question a concept of \textit{coherence} is introduced. Both the differential
equation (the PDE translating the least action principle) and the variational
structure can be embedded at the discrete level. This provides two discrete
embeddings for the original problem. In case these procedures finally provide
the same discrete problem we will say that the discretisation is
\textit{coherent}. Our purpose is illustrated with the Poisson problem.
Coherence for discrete embeddings of Lagrangian structures is studied for
various classical discretisations (finite elements, finite differences and
finite volumes). Hamiltonian structures are shown to provide coherence between
a discrete Hamiltonian structure and the discretisation of the mixed
formulation of the PDE, both for mixed finite elements and mimetic finite
differences methods.

the conditions that determine the nucleosynthesis, i.e., neutron enrichment,

mergers to be the main source of heavy (A > 140) galactic r-nuclei for merger

investigate which network structures can reproduce a certain multistable

to approach these questions, we use a modeling framework which only uses
qualitative information about the network, yet allows model discrimination as
well as to evaluate the robustness of the desired multistability properties. We
reveal structural network properties which are necessary and sufficient to
realize distinct steady state patterns required for cell differentiation. Our

Sun's magnetic field, summarising both observational evidence and theoretical
models. The eleven year solar cycle, which is well known from a variety of
observed quantities, strongly supports the idea of a large-scale solar dynamo.
Current theoretical ideas on the location and mechanism of this dynamo are
presented.
  The solar cycle influences the behaviour of the global coronal magnetic field
and it is the eruptions of this field that can impact on the Earth's
environment. These global coronal variations can be modelled to a surprising
degree of accuracy. Recent high resolution observations of the Sun's magnetic
field in quiet regions, away from sunspots, show that there is a continual
evolution of a small-scale magnetic field, presumably produced by small-scale
dynamo action in the solar interior.
  Sunspots, a natural consequence of the large-scale dynamo, emerge, evolve and
disperse over a period of several days. Numerical simulations can help to
determine the physical processes governing the emergence of sunspots. We
discuss the interaction of these emerging fields with the pre-existing coronal
field, resulting in a variety of dynamic phenomena.

at the VLTI between April 2004 and July 2007, covering pulsation phases
0.45-0.85 within four cycles. The data are modeled with a radiative transfer
model of the dust shell where the central stellar intensity profile is
described by a series of dust-free dynamic model atmospheres based on
self-excited pulsation models. We examined two dust species, silicate and Al2O3
grains. We performed model simulations using variations in model phase and dust
shell parameters to investigate the expected variability of our photometric and
interferometric data. The observed visibility spectra do not show any
indication of variations as a function of pulsation phase and cycle. The
observed photometry spectra may indicate intracycle and cycle-to-cycle
variations at the level of 1-2 standard deviations. The best-fitting model for
our average pulsation phase of 0.64+/-0.15 includes the dynamic model
atmosphere M21n (T_model=2550 K) with a photospheric angular diameter of
7.6+/-0.6 mas, and a silicate dust shell with an optical depth of 2.8+/-0.8, an
inner radius of 4.1+/-0.7 R_Phot, and a power-law index of the density
distribution of 2.6+/-0.3. The addition of an Al2O3 dust shell did not improve
the model fit. The photospheric angular diameter corresponds to a radius of
520^+230_-140 R_sun and an effective temperature of ~ 2420+/-200 K. Our
modeling simulations confirm that significant visibility variations are not
expected for RR Aql at mid-infrared wavelengths within our uncertainties.
  We conclude that our RR Aql data can be described by a pulsating atmosphere
surrounded by a silicate dust shell. The effects of the pulsation on the
mid-infrared flux and visibility values are expected to be less than about 25%
and 20%, respectively, and are too low to be detected within our measurement
uncertainties.

the vicinity of super-massive black holes (SMBH), irrespective of their
activity state. In the magnetosphere of rotating SMBH, efficient acceleration
of charged particles can take place through various processes. These particles
could reach energies up to E~10^{19}eV. VHE gamma-ray emission from these
particles is then feasible via leptonic or hadronic processes. Therefore
passive systems, where the lack of a strong photon field allows the VHE
gamma-rays to escape, are expected to be detected by Cherenkov telescopes. We
present results from recent VHE experiments on the passive SMBH in the nearby
elliptical galaxy NGC 1399. No gamma-ray signal has been found, neither by the
H.E.S.S. experiment nor in the Fermi data analyzed here. We discuss possible
implications for the physical characteristics of the system. We conclude that
in a scenario where particles are accelerated in vacuum gaps in the
magnetosphere, only a fraction ~0.3 of the gap is available for particle
acceleration, indicating that the system is unlikely to be able to accelerate
protons up to E~10^{19} eV.

destabilization of free convective flows by weak rotation. After studying
several models where flows are driven by a simultaneous action of convection
and rotation, it is concluded that the destabilization is observed in the cases
where centrifugal force acts against main convective circulation. At relatively
low Prandtl numbers this counter action can split the main vortex into two
counter rotating vortices, where the interaction leads to instability. At
larger Prandtl numbers, the counter action of the centrifugal force steepens an
unstable thermal stratification, which triggers Rayleigh-B\'enard instability
mechanism. Both cases can be enhanced by advection of azimuthal velocity
disturbances towards the axis, where they grow and excite perturbations of the
radial velocity. The effect was studied considering a combined
convective/rotating flow in a cylinder with a rotating lid and a parabolic
temperature profile at the sidewall. Next, explanations of the destabilization
effect for rotating magnetic field driven flow and melt flow in a Czochralski
crystal growth model were derived.

vector multiplication subproblem within) using conjugate gradient algorithm,
and LU/Cholesky decomposition for solving system of linear equations, form the
kernel of many applications, such as circuit simulators, computational fluid
dynamics or structural analysis etc. The problem of designing approaches for
parallelizing these computations, to get good speedups as much as possible as
per Amdahl's law, has been continuously researched upon. In this paper, we
discuss approaches based on the use of finite projective geometry graphs for
these two problems. For the problem of conjugate gradient algorithm, the
approach looks at an alternative data distribution based on projective-geometry
concepts. It is proved that this data distribution is an optimal data
distribution for scheduling the main problem of dense matrix-vector
multiplication. For the problem of parallel LU/Cholesky decomposition of
general matrices, the approach is motivated by the recently published scheme
for interconnects of distributed systems, perfect difference networks. We find
that projective-geometry based graphs indeed offer an exciting way of
parallelizing these computations, and in fact many others. Moreover, their
applications ranges from architectural ones (interconnect choice) to
algorithmic ones (data distributions).

exploring area of research in functional genomics. Many computational tools
have been developed for finding motifs and each of them has their own
advantages as well as disadvantages. Most of these algorithms need prior
knowledge about the data to construct background models. However there is not a
single technique that can be considered as best for finding regulatory motifs.
This paper proposes an artificial immune system based algorithm for finding the
transcription factor binding sites or motifs and two new weighted scores for
motif evaluation. The algorithm is enumerative, but sufficient pruning of the
pattern search space has been incorporated using immune system concepts. The
performance of AISMOTIF has been evaluated by comparing it with eight state of

  CSI: An ADMM Approach",,,"10.1109/TSP.2012.2188719",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-cell coordinated beamforming (MCBF), where multiple base stations (BSs)
collaborate with each other in the beamforming design for mitigating the
inter-cell interference, has been a subject drawing great attention recently.
Most MCBF designs assume perfect channel state information (CSI) of mobile
stations (MSs); however CSI errors are inevitable at the BSs in practice.
Assuming elliptically bounded CSI errors, this paper studies the robust MCBF
design problem that minimizes the weighted sum power of BSs subject to
worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints on the
MSs. Our goal is to devise a distributed optimization method that can obtain
the worst-case robust beamforming solutions in a decentralized fashion, with
only local CSI used at each BS and little backhaul signaling for message
exchange between BSs. However, the considered problem is difficult to handle
even in the centralized form. We first propose an efficient approximation
method in the centralized form, based on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
technique. To obtain the robust beamforming solution in a decentralized
fashion, we further propose a distributed robust MCBF algorithm, using a
distributed convex optimization technique known as alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM). We analytically show the convergence of the proposed
distributed robust MCBF algorithm to the optimal centralized solution and its
better bandwidth efficiency in backhaul signaling over the existing dual
decomposition based algorithms. Simulation results are presented to examine the
effectiveness of the proposed SDR method and the distributed robust MCBF
algorithm.
