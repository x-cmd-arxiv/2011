conjunction with the forthcoming burst of the gold bubble suggests that the
World System is entering a bifurcation zone bearing rather high risks of the
second wave of the global financial-economic crisis. Indeed, on the one hand,
it is obvious that such a collapse may lead to huge losses or even bankruptcies
of many of the major participants of exchange games and their dependent firms
and banks. Therefore, the immediate market reaction is likely to be entirely
negative. Negative impact on the market could well be amplified by numerous
publications in the media and business press, drawing analogies with the events
of the early 1980s and earlier similar events, as well as by losses of
shareholders of bankrupt companies. On the other hand, investments in gold also
lead to the diversion of funds from stock market investments and to the
reduction in the production of goods and services. If at the time of the
collapse some promising areas of investment appear in the developed and / or
developing countries, the investment can move to those markets, which, on the
contrary, could contribute to the production of new goods and services and
accelerate the way out of the crisis. It is also obvious that the decline of
the oil (and other energy/mineral resources) prices may contribute to
acceleration of world economic growth rates and world economic recovery.

covering the swash and surf zones. The chosen transects are the two furthest
(north and south) from the pier located at the study site. Research at Duck has
traditionally focused on one or more of these transects as the effects of the
pier are least at these locations. The patterns are identified using singular
spectrum analysis (SSA). Possible correlations with potential forcing
mechanisms are discussed by 1) doing an SSA with same parameter settings to
independently identify the quasi-periodic cycles embedded within three
potentially linked sequences: monthly wave heights (MWH), monthly mean water
levels (MWL) and the large scale atmospheric index known as the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) and 2) comparing the patterns within MWH, MWL and NAO to the
local bathymetric patterns. The results agree well with previous patterns
identified using wavelets and confirm the highly nonstationary behaviour of
beach levels at Duck; the discussion of potential correlations with
hydrodynamic and atmospheric phenomena is a new contribution. The study is then
extended to all measured bathymetric profiles, covering an area of 1100m
(alongshore) by 440m (cross-shore), to 1) analyse linear correlations between
the bathymetry and the potential forcings using multivariate empirical
orthogonal functions (MEOF) and linear correlation analysis and 2) identify

within MWH, MWL or NAO, based on a (nonlinear) multichannel singular spectrum

properties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physics
that underpins stellar pulsation. The common notion that all stars in an open
cluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition,
implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precision
than what is usually achievable for single stars. This makes clusters ideal for
exploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillations
and the global stellar properties. We have analyzed data obtained with NASA's
Kepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant stars
located in either of the three open clusters, NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811.
By fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relations
that depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that the
data cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio as
previously assumed. As a result we provide a new improved empirical relation
which treats luminosity and mass separately. This relation turns out to also
work remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. In addition, the
measured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previously
unknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, pointing
to an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into the
formation history of open clusters.

analogous to the Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) approach which is used on

such parameterizations are only exactly applicable in the quasistatic regime.
On larger scales they fail to encapsulate the full behaviour of typical models

the simplest example of such a model, namely a topological field theory with
defects which we describe via lattice TFT. Finally, we give an application in
algebra, where the defect TFT provides us with a functorial definition of the

higher categories - in our case bicategories - in the description of field

$\gamma$-rays in the highest energy range. We made a new combined analysis of
CO and \ion{H}{1} in the SNR and derived the total protons in the interstellar
medium (ISM). We have found that the inclusion of the \ion{H}{1} gas provides a
significantly better spatial match between the TeV $\gamma$-rays and ISM
protons than the H$_2$ gas alone. In particular, the southeastern rim of the
$\gamma$-ray shell has a counterpart only in the \ion{H}{1}. The finding shows
that the ISM proton distribution is consistent with the hadronic scenario that
comic ray (CR) protons react with ISM protons to produce the $\gamma$-rays.
This provides another step forward for the hadronic origin of the $\gamma$-rays
by offering one of the necessary conditions missing in the previous hadronic
interpretations. We argue that the highly inhomogeneous distribution of the ISM
protons is crucial in the origin of the $\gamma$-rays. Most of the neutral gas
was likely swept up by the stellar wind of an OB star prior to the SNe to form
a low-density cavity and a swept-up dense wall. The cavity explains the
low-density site where the diffusive shock acceleration of charged particles
takes place with suppressed thermal X-rays, whereas the CR protons can reach
the target protons in the wall to produce the $\gamma$-rays. The present
finding allows us to estimate the total CR proton energy to be $\sim 10^{48}$
ergs, 0.1% of the total energy of a SNe.

comparative analysis of the WMAP 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year data releases for the
CMB angular power spectrum with respect to the following key questions: (a) How
well is the power spectrum determined by the data alone? (b) How well is the
$\Lambda$CDM model supported by a model-independent, data-driven analysis? (c)
What are the realistic uncertainties on peak/dip locations and heights? Our
results show that the height of the power spectrum is well determined by data
alone for multipole l approximately less than 546 (1-year), 667 (3-year), 804
(5-year), and 842 (7-year data). We show that parametric fits based on the
$\Lambda$CDM model are remarkably close to our nonparametric fits in
$l$-regions where data are sufficiently precise. In contrast, the power
spectrum for an H$\Lambda$CDM model gets progressively pushed away from our
nonparametric fit as data quality improves with successive data realizations,
suggesting incompatibility of this particular cosmological model with respect
to the WMAP data sets. We present uncertainties on peak/dip locations and
heights at the 95% ($2 \sigma$) level of confidence, and show how these
uncertainties translate into hyperbolic ""bands"" on the acoustic scale ($l_A$)
and peak shift ($\phi_m$) parameters. Based on the confidence set for the
7-year data, we argue that the low-l up-turn in the CMB power spectrum cannot
be ruled out at any confidence level in excess of about 10% ($\approx 0.12
\sigma$). Additional outcomes of this work are a numerical formulation for
minimization of a noise-weighted risk function subject to monotonicity
constraints, a prescription for obtaining nonparametric fits that are closer to
cosmological expectations on smoothness, and a method for sampling
cosmologically meaningful power spectrum variations from the confidence set of
a nonparametric fit.

(SMBHs) in gas-poor galactic nuclei due to the high merger rate of galaxies at
high redshifts. We calculate the relative likelihood of binary, triple, and
quadruple SMBH systems, by considering the timescales for relevant processes
and combining merger trees with N-body simulations for the dynamics of stars
and SMBHs in galactic nuclei. Typical haloes today with mass $M_0\approx
10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ have an average mass $M_{z=6}=5\times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ at
$z\sim 6$, while rare haloes with current mass $M_0\gtrsim 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$
have an average mass $M_{z=6}=5\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ at that redshift.
These cluster-size haloes are expected to host single galaxies at $z\sim 6$. We
expect about 30% galaxies within haloes with present-day mass $M_0\approx
10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ to contain more than two SMBHs at redshifts $2\lesssim
z\lesssim 6$. For larger present-day haloes, with $M_0\gtrsim 10^{15}$
M$_\odot$, this fraction is almost 60%. The existence of multiple SMBHs at high
redshifts can potentially explain the mass deficiencies observed in the cores
of massive elliptical galaxies, which are up to 5 times the mass of their
central BHs. Multiple SMBHs would also lead to an enhanced rate of tidal
disruption of stars, modified gravitational wave signals compared to isolated
BH binaries, and slingshot ejection of SMBHs from galaxies at high speeds in
excess of 2000 km s$^{-1}$.

PGB and KGB by reducing to BGB rather than by introducing additional machinery.
A concise definition for reduced expressions and a simple proof of the exchange

argument for spherical subgroups, which includes all of the cases considered,
shows that Bruhat order has property Z and therefore satisfies the
subexpression property. Thus, Bruhat order can be described using only simple
relations, and it is the simple relations which we simplify combinatorially. A
parametrization of KGP is a simple consequence of understanding the Bruhat

is studied. The finite difference method is employed to solve the

front-tracking method is adopted to track the moving deformable drop interface.
In the hot region, deformations of drops increase with the decrease of
interfacial tensions. In order to indicate the temperature impact on the
interfacial tension, a local capillary number ($Ca_l$) is introduced. It is
found that, when the drop density is smaller/larger than that of the bulk

within errors. By studying the contribution of the 23 process to \eta, we find
that the minimum angle \theta among the final state gluons in the fluid local
rest frame has a distribution that is peaked at \theta \sim \sqrt{\alpha_{s}},
analogous to the near collinear splitting asserted by AMY and ADM. However, the
average of \theta is much bigger than its peak value, as its distribution is
skewed with a long tail. The same \theta behavior is also seen if the 23 matrix
element is taken to the soft gluon bremsstrahlung limit in the center-of-mass

This is the simplest system that experiences electromagnetically induced

excited to ground state. We investigate the influence of Doppler broadening,
velocity-changing collisions (VCC), and phase-changing collisions (PCC) with a
buffer gas on the EIA spectrum of optically active atoms. In addition to exact
expressions, we present an approximate solution for the probe absorption
spectrum, which provides physical insight into the behavior of the EIA peak due
to VCC, PCC, and wave-vector difference between the pump and probe beams. VCC
are shown to produce a wide pedestal at the base of the EIA peak, which is
scarcely affected by the pump-probe angular deviation, whereas the sharp
central EIA peak becomes weaker and broader due to the residual Doppler-Dicke
effect. Using diffusion-like equations for the atomic coherences and
populations, we construct a spatial-frequency filter for a spatially structured
probe beam and show that Ramsey narrowing of the EIA peak is obtained for beams
of finite width.

flattened components (thin+thick disk plus an extra and more extended

could be interpreted as a thick disk or as a squashed ellipsoidal halo and
contains ~20% of the total mass of all three stellar components. We argue it is
unlikely to be related to the ongoing merger or due to the off-plane stars from
a warp in the other two disk components. Instead, we favor a scenario in which
the thick disk and the extended component were formed in a two-stage process,
in which an initially thick disk has been dynamically heated by a merger soon
enough in the galaxy history to have a new thick disk formed within it.

both fundamental physics and technological applications such as spintronics and
quantum information processing. In a topological insulator, the bulk energy gap
is traversed by spin-momentum locked surface states forming an odd number of
surface bands that possesses unique electronic properties. However, transport
measurements have often been dominated by residual bulk carriers from crystal
defects or environmental doping which mask the topological surface
contribution. Here we demonstrate (BixSb1-x)2Te3 as a tunable topological
insulator system to manipulate bulk conductivity by varying the Bi/Sb
composition ratio. (BixSb1-x)2Te3 ternary compounds are confirmed as
topological insulators for the entire composition range by angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and ab initio calculations.
Additionally, we observe a clear ambipolar gating effect similar to that
observed in graphene using nanoplates of (BixSb1-x)2Te3 in
field-effect-transistor (FET) devices. The manipulation of carrier type and
concentration in topological insulator nanostructures demonstrated in this
study paves the way for implementation of topological insulators in
nanoelectronics and spintronics.

probability of any two observables whose eigenstates have non-zero mutual
overlap. Transformations to a new basis set are then expressed in terms of
complex conditional probabilities that describe the fundamental relation
between precise statements about the three different observables. Since such
transformations merely change the representation of the quantum state, these
conditional probabilities provide a state-independent definition of the
deterministic relation between the outcomes of different quantum measurements.
In this paper, it is shown how classical reality emerges as an approximation to
the fundamental laws of quantum determinism expressed by complex conditional
probabilities. The quantum mechanical origin of phase spaces and trajectories
is identified and implications for the interpretation of quantum measurements
are considered. It is argued that the transformation laws of quantum
determinism provide a fundamental description of the measurement dependence of
empirical reality.

often require classification of the data into elementary relevant classes. A
typical example is the separation of riparian vegetation from ground in fluvial
environments, the distinction between fresh surfaces and rockfall in cliff
environments, or more generally the classification of surfaces according to
their morphology. Natural surfaces are heterogeneous and their distinctive
properties are seldom defined at a unique scale, prompting the use of
multi-scale criteria to achieve a high degree of classification success. We
have thus defined a multi-scale measure of the point cloud dimensionality
around each point, which characterizes the local 3D organization. We can thus
monitor how the local cloud geometry behaves across scales. We present the
technique and illustrate its efficiency in separating riparian vegetation from
ground and classifying a mountain stream as vegetation, rock, gravel or water
surface. In these two cases, separating the vegetation from ground or other
classes achieve accuracy larger than 98 %. Comparison with a single scale
approach shows the superiority of the multi-scale analysis in enhancing class
separability and spatial resolution. The technique is robust to missing data,
shadow zones and changes in point density within the scene. The classification
is fast and accurate and can account for some degree of intra-class
morphological variability such as different vegetation types. A probabilistic
confidence in the classification result is given at each point, allowing the
user to remove the points for which the classification is uncertain. The
process can be both fully automated, but also fully customized by the user
including a graphical definition of the classifiers. Although developed for
fully 3D data, the method can be readily applied to 2.5D airborne lidar data.

non-thermal spectra were identified as SNRs. We have discovered two new, large,
faint SNRs, G178.2-4.2 and G25.1-2.3, both of which show shell structure.
G178.2-4.2 has a size of 72 arcmin x 62 arcmin with strongly polarized emission
being detected along its northern shell. The spectrum of G178.2-4.2 is
non-thermal, with an integrated spectral index of $\alpha = -0.48\pm0.13$. Its
surface brightness is $\Sigma_{1 GHz} = 7.2 x 10^{-23}{Wm^{-2} Hz^{-1}

arcmin x 30\arcmin. It has a non-thermal radio spectrum with a spectral index
of $\alpha = -0.49\pm0.13$. Two new large shell-type SNRs have been detected at
$\lambda$6\ cm in an area of 2200 deg^2 along the the Galactic plane. This

meson-baryon (PB) dynamics has been earlier found determinant for the existence
of some strangeness -1 resonances, for example, $\Lambda(1405)$,
$\Lambda(1670)$, etc. The motivation of the present work is to study the effect
of coupling the closed vector meson-baryon (VB) channels to these resonances.
To do this, we obtain the $PB \rightarrow PB$ and $VB \rightarrow VB$
amplitudes from the t-channel diagrams and the $PB \leftrightarrow VB$
amplitudes are calculated using the Kroll-Ruddermann term where, considering
the vector meson dominance phenomena, the photon is replaced by a vector meson.
The calculations done within this formalism reveal a very strong coupling of
the VB channels to the $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$. In the isospin 1
case, we find an evidence for a double pole structure of the $\Sigma (1480)$
which, like the isospin 0 resonances, is also found to couple strongly to the
VB channels. The strong coupling of these low-lying resonances to the VB
channels can have important implications on certain reactions producing them.

that is simple enough to admit a thorough numerical investigation while
allowing spatio-temporal dynamics that are substantially more complex than
those allowed in previous modal truncations. Our model allows a comparison of
the dynamics resulting from initial perturbations that are localised in the
spanwise direction with those resulting from sinusoidal perturbations. For
spanwise-localised initial conditions the subcritical transition to a
`turbulent' state (i) takes place more abruptly, with a boundary between
laminar and `turbulent' flow that is appears to be much less `structured' and
(ii) results in a spatiotemporally chaotic regime within which the lifetimes of
spatiotemporally complicated transients are longer, and are even more sensitive
to initial conditions. The minimum initial energy $E_0$ required for a
spanwise-localised initial perturbation to excite a chaotic transient has a
power-law scaling with Reynolds number $E_0 \sim Re^p$ with $p \approx -4.3$.
The exponent $p$ depends only weakly on the width of the localised perturbation
and is lower than that commonly observed in previous low-dimensional models
where typically $p \approx -2$. The distributions of lifetimes of chaotic
transients at fixed Reynolds number are found to be consistent with exponential
distributions.

so-called near-infrared (NIR) excess is impossible to reproduce even with the
most recent spectral synthesis models (that include a self-consistent treatment

partially embedded by their natal cocoons (since deeply embedded clusters are
probably too faint to be detected). We discuss possible explanations for this

a class of critical routing models, equivalent to random maps, which can be
solved rigorously in the thermodynamic limit. The information flow is conserved
for these routing models and governed by cyclic attractors. We consider two
classes of information flow, Markovian routing without memory and vertex
routing involving a one-step routing memory. Investigating the respective cycle
length distributions for complete graphs we find log corrections to power-law
scaling for the mean cycle length, as a function of the number of vertices, and
a sub-polynomial growth for the overall number of cycles.
  When observing experimentally a real-world dynamical system one normally
samples stochastically its phase space. The number and the length of the
attractors are then weighted by the size of their respective basins of
attraction. This situation is equivalent to `on the fly' generation of routing
tables for which we find power law scaling for the weighted average length of
attractors, for both conserved routing models. These results show that critical
dynamical systems are generically not scale-invariant, but may show power-law
scaling when sampled stochastically. It is hence important to distinguish
between intrinsic properties of a critical dynamical system and its behavior
that one would observe when randomly probing its phase space.

present deep GALEX near and far ultraviolet observations, used as a recent star
formation tracer, and we compare them with new, high resolution (16"", or 1.6
kpc) VLA HI observations. The UV and HI maps show good spatial correlation
outside the inner 1', where the HI phase dominates over H_2. Star-forming
regions in the extended gaseous disk are mainly located along the enhanced HI
emission within two (relatively) symmetric giant gaseous spiral arm-like
features, which emulate a HI pseudo-ring at a r \simeq 3' . Inside such
structure, two smaller gaseous spiral arms extend from the NE and SW of the
optical disk and connect to the previously mentioned HI pseudo-ring.
Interestingly, we find that the (atomic) Kennicutt-Schmidt power law index
systematically decreases with radius, from N \simeq 3.0 +- 0.3 in the inner
disk (0.'8 - 1.'7) to N = 1.6 +- 0.5 in the outskirts of the gaseous disk (3.'3
- 4.'2). Although the star formation efficiency (SFE), the star formation rate
per unit of gas, decreases with radius where the HI component dominates as is
common in galaxies, we find that there is a break of the correlation at r = 1.5
r_25. At radii 1.5 r_25 < r < 3.5 r_25, mostly within the HI pseudo-ring
structure, there exist regions whose SFE remains nearly constant, SFE \simeq
10^-11 yr^-1. We discuss about possible mechanisms that might be triggering the
star formation in the outskirts of this galaxy, and we suggest that the
constant SFE for such large radii r > 2 r_25 and at such low surface densities
might be a common characteristic in extended UV disk galaxies.

related to the physics of coronal neutral sheets and streamers, occurring above
lines of magnetic polarity reversal. Filaments and prominences correspond to
the cool coronal component of these regions.
  Aims: We examine the dynamical behaviour of these structures where
reconnection and dissipation of magnetic energy in the turbulent plasma are
occurring. The link between the observed oscillatory motions and the eruption
occurrence is investigated in detail for two different events.
  Method: Two filaments are analysed using two different datasets: time series
of spectra using a transition region line (He I at 584.33 A) and a coronal line
(Mg X at 609.79 A) measured with CDS on-board SOHO, observed on May 30, 2003,
and time series of intensity and velocity images from the NSO/Dunn Solar
Telescope in the Halpha line on September 18, 1994 for the other. The
oscillatory content is investigated using Fourier transform and wavelet
analysis and is compared to different models.
  Results: In both filaments, oscillations are clearly observed, in intensity
and velocity in the He I and Mg X lines, in velocity in Halpha, with similar
periods from a few minutes up to 80 minutes, with a main range from 20 to 30
minutes, cotemporal with eruptions. Both filaments exhibit vertical oscillating
motions. For the filament observed in the UV (He I and Mg X lines), we provide
evidence of damped velocity oscillations, and for the filament observed in the
visible (Halpha line), we provide evidence that parts of the filament are
oscillating, while the filament is moving over the solar surface, before its
disappearance.

sensitive interaction diagnostic at our disposal. We report here on a study of
HI profile asymmetries (e.g., lopsidedness) in a sample of some of the most
isolated galaxies in the local Universe. This presents us with an excellent
opportunity to quantify the range of intrinsic HI asymmetries and provides us
with a zero-point calibration for evaluating these measurements in less
isolated samples. We characterize the HI profile asymmetries and search for
correlations between HI asymmetry and their environments, as well as their
optical and far infrared (FIR) properties. We use high signal-to-noise global
HI profiles for galaxies in the AMIGA project (http://amiga.iaa.csic.es). We
restrict our study to N=166 galaxies with accurate measures of the HI shape
properties. We quantify asymmetries using a flux ratio parameter. The asymmetry
parameter distribution of our isolated sample is well described by a Gaussian
model. The width of the distribution is sigma=0.13, and could be even smaller
(sigma=0.11) if instrumental errors are reduced. Only 2% of our carefully
vetted isolated galaxies sample show an asymmetry in excess of 3sigma. By using
this sample we minimize environmental effects as confirmed by the lack of
correlation between HI asymmetry and tidal force (one-on-one interactions) and
neighbor galaxy number density. On the other hand, field galaxy samples show
wider distributions and deviate from a Gaussian curve. As a result we find
higher asymmetry rates (~10-20%) in such samples. We find evidence that the
spiral arm strength is inversely correlated with the HI asymmetry. We also find
an excess of FIR luminous galaxies with larger HI asymmetries that may be
spirals associated with hidden accretion events. Our sample presents the
smallest fraction of asymmetric HI profiles compared with any other yet
studied.

suggest that the flare triggering was due to the reconnection of a rising flux
rope with the surrounding low-lying magnetic loops. The flux rope reached a
projected height of ~0.15 Rs with a speed of ~90 km/s while the soft X-ray flux
enhanced gradually during its rise. The flux rope was suppressed by an
overlying field and the filled plasma moved towards the negative polarity field
to the west of its activation site. We find the first observational evidence of
the initial suppression of a flux rope due to a remnant filament visible both
at chromospheric and coronal temperatures that evolved couple of days before at
the same location in the active region. SOHO/MDI magnetograms show the
emergence of a bipole ~12 h prior to the flare initiation. The emerged negative
polarity moved towards the flux rope activation site, and flare triggering near
the photospheric polarity inversion line (PIL) took place. The motion of the
negative polarity region towards PIL helped in the build-up of magnetic energy
at the flare and flux rope activation site. This study provides a unique
observational evidence of a rising flux rope that failed to erupt due to a
remnant filament and overlying magnetic field, as well as associated triggering

the use of star-formation contribution functions as a device for evaluating the
birth rates, total number and merger rates of DDs. These contribution functions
help to demonstrate the relation between star-formation history and the current
DD population and, in particular, show how the numbers of different types of DD
are sensitive to different epochs of star formation.
  We have compared the impact of different star-formation models on the rates
and numbers of DDs and on the rates of type Ia (SNIa) and core-collapse
supernovae (ccSN). In addition to a quasi-exponential decline model, we
considered an instantaneous (or initial starburst) model, a constant-rate
model, and an enhanced-rate model. All were normalised to produce the present
observed star density in the local thin disc. The evolution of the rates and
numbers of both DDs and SNIa are different in all four models, but are most
markedly different in the instantaneous star-formation model, which produces a
much higher rate than the other three models in the past, primarily as a
consequence of the normalisation.
  Predictions of the current SNIa rate range from ~2 to 5\times10^{-4} yr^{-1}
in the four models, and are slightly below the observed rate because we only
consider the DD merger channel. The predicted ccSN rate ranges from 1.5 to 3
century^{-1}, and is consistent with observations.

galaxies and the dark matter haloes they inhabit from z~1.2 to the present day.
We do this by comparing precise galaxy clustering measurements over 133 deg2 of
the ""Wide"" component of the CFHT Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) with predictions of an
analytic HOD model where the number of galaxies in each halo depends only on
the halo mass. Starting from a parent catalogue of ~ 3x10^6 galaxies at i'_AB <
22.5 we use accurate photometric redshifts calibrated using ~ 10^4
spectroscopic redshifts to create a series of type-selected volume-limited
samples covering 0.2 < z < 1.2. Our principal result, based on clustering
measurements in these samples, is a robust determination of the
luminosity-to-halo mass ratio and its dependence on redshift and galaxy type.
For the full sample, this reaches a peak at low redshifts of Mh,peak =
4.5x10^11 h^-1 M_sun and moves towards higher halo masses at higher redshifts.
For redder galaxies the peak is at higher halo masses and does not evolve
significantly over the entire redshift range of our survey. We also consider
the evolution of bias, average halo mass and the fraction of satellites as a
function of redshift and luminosity. Our observed growth of a factor of ~ 2 in
satellite fraction between z~1 and z~0 is testament to the limited role that
galaxy merging plays in galaxy evolution for ~ 10^12 h^-1 M_sun mass haloes at
z<1. Qualitatively, our observations are consistent with a picture in which red
galaxies in massive haloes have already accumulated most of their stellar mass

allows us to perform dynamical atomic relaxation in the presence of an electric

idea consists in expressing the system energy density matrix in terms of
Green's functions. In order to validate our implementation we perform a series
of benchmark calculations, both at zero and finite bias. Firstly we evaluate
the current-induced forces acting over an Al nanowire and compare them with
previously published results for fixed geometries. Then we perform structural
relaxation of the same wires under bias and determine the critical voltage at
which they break. We find that, while a perfectly straight wire does not break
at any of the voltages considered, a zigzag wire is more fragile and snaps at
1.4 V, with the Al atoms moving against the electron flow. Finally we
demonstrate the capability of our scheme to tackle the electromigration problem
by studying the current-induced motion of a single Si atom covalently attached
to the sidewall of a (4,4) armchair single-walled carbon nanotube. Our
calculations indicate that if Si is attached along the current path, then
current-induced forces can induce migration. In contrast, if the bonding site
is away from the current path, then the adatom will remain stable regardless of
the voltage. An analysis based on decomposing the total force into a wind and
an electrostatic component, as well as on a detailed evaluation of the bond
currents, shows that this remarkable electromigration phenomenon is due solely

knowledge (noncoherent channel) has gained increasing interest in recent years,
but it is still unknown for the general case. In this paper we derive bounds on
the capacity of the noncoherent, underspread complex Gaussian, orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), wide sense stationary channel with
uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS), under a peak power constraint or a constraint
on the second and fourth moments of the transmitted signal. These bounds are
characterized only by the system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and by a newly
defined quantity termed effective coherence time. Analysis of the effective
coherence time reveals that it can be interpreted as the length of a block in
the block fading model in which a system with the same SNR will achieve the
same capacity as in the analyzed channel. Unlike commonly used coherence time
definitions, it is shown that the effective coherence time depends on the SNR,
and is a nonincreasing function of it. We show that for low SNR the capacity is
proportional to the effective coherence time, while for higher SNR the coherent
channel capacity can be achieved provided that the effective coherence time is
large enough.

within an effective radius (se), this allows us to explore the location of our
galaxies in the main scaling relations. We investigate the dependence of these
relations on our recent kinematical classification of early-type galaxies (i.e.
Slow/Fast Rotators) and the stellar populations. Slow Rotator and Fast Rotator
E/S0 galaxies do not populate distinct locations in the scaling relations,
although Slow Rotators display a smaller intrinsic scatter. Surprisingly,
extremely young objects do not display the bluest (V-[3.6]) colours in our
sample, as is usually the case in optical colours. This can be understood in
the context of the large contribution of TP-AGB stars to the infrared, even for
young populations, resulting in a very tight (V-[3.6]) - se relation that in
turn allows us to define a strong correlation between metallicity and velocity
dispersion. Many Sa galaxies appear to follow the Fundamental Plane defined by
E/S0 galaxies. Galaxies that appear offset from the relations correspond mostly
to objects with extremely young populations, with signs of on-going, extended
star formation. We correct for this effect in the Fundamental Plane, by
replacing luminosity with stellar mass using an estimate of the stellar
mass-to-light ratio, so that all galaxies are part of a tight, single relation.
The new estimated coefficients are consistent in both photometric bands and
suggest that differences in stellar populations account for about half of the
observed tilt with respect to the virial prediction. After these corrections,
the Slow Rotator family shows almost no intrinsic scatter around the best-fit
Fundamental Plane.

very inefficient as their optical colors are indistinguishable from those of

colors to improve the identifications of the missing quasars in this redshift
range. Here we present a case study by combining both factors. We select a
sample of 70 quasar candidates from variables in SDSS Stripe 82, which are
non-UV excess sources and have UKIDSS near-IR public data. They are clearly
separated into two parts on the Y-K/g-z color-color diagram, and 59 of them
meet or lie close to a newly proposed Y-K/g-z selection criterion for z<4
quasars. 44 of these 59 sources have been previously identified as quasars in
SDSS DR7, and 35 among them are quasars at 2.2<z<3. We present spectroscopic
observations of 14 of 15 remaining quasar candidates using the Bok 2.3m
telescope and the MMT 6.5m telescope, and successfully identify all of them as
new quasars at z=2.36 to 2.88. We also apply this method to a sample of 643
variable quasar candidates with SDSS-UKIDSS nine-band photometric data selected
from 1875 new quasar candidates in SDSS Stripe 82 given by Butler & Bloom based
on the time-series selections, and find that 188 of them are probably new
quasars with photometric redshifts at 2.2<z<3. Our results indicate that the
combination of optical variability and optical/near-IR colors is probably the
most efficient way in finding 2.2<z<3 quasars and very helpful for constructing
a complete quasar sample. We discuss its implications to the ongoing and
upcoming large optical and near-IR sky surveys.

essential role in the evolution of galaxies. The winds of massive stars not
only significantly influence their surroundings, but the mass loss also
profoundly affects the evolution of the stars themselves. In addition to the
evolution of each star, the evolution of the dense cores of massive starburst
clusters is affected by N-body interactions, and the formation of very massive
stars via mergers may be decisive for the evolution of the cluster.
  Aims: To introduce an advanced diagnostic method of O-type stellar
atmospheres with winds, including an assessment of the accuracy of the
determinations of abundances, stellar and wind parameters.
  Methods: We combine consistent models of expanding atmospheres with detailed
stellar evolutionary calculations of massive and very massive single stars with
regard to the evolution of dense stellar clusters. Accurate predictions of the
mass loss rates of very massive stars requires a highly consistent treatment of
the statistical equilibrium and the hydrodynamic and radiative processes in the
expanding atmospheres.
  Results: We present computed mass loss rates, terminal wind velocities, and
spectral energy distributions of massive and very massive stars of different
metallicities, calculated from atmospheric models with an improved level of
consistency.
  Conclusions: Stellar evolutionary calculations using our computed mass loss
rates show that low-metallicity very massive stars lose only a very small
amount of their mass, making it unlikely that very massive population III stars
cause a significant helium enrichment of the interstellar medium.
Solar-metallicity stars have higher mass-loss rates, but these are not so high
to exclude very massive stars formed by mergers in dense clusters from ending
their life massive enough to form intermediate-mass black holes.

by-product, we derive some interesting new distributional properties enjoyed by
a large class of this random variable, such as the absolute continuity of its

density. This type of results is then used to derive similar properties for the
law of maxima and first passage time of some stable L\'evy processes. Thus, for
example, we show that for a large class of stable processes the first passage
time has a bounded and non-increasing density on the positive half-line. We

multiwavelength campaign using five satellites (XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, Chandra,
HST and Swift) and two ground-based facilities (WHT and PAIRITEL). Our
observations cover more than five decades in frequency, from 2 um to 200 keV.
The combination of high-resolution spectroscopy and time variability allows us
to disentangle and study the different components. Our campaign covers 100 days
from September to December 2009, and is centred on a simultaneous set of deep
XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL observations with regular time intervals, spanning
seven weeks. We obtain a continuous light curve in the X-ray and UV band,
showing a strong, up to 60% flux increase in the soft X-ray band during the
three weeks in the middle of our deepest monitoring campaign, and which is
correlated with an enhancement of the UV flux. This allows us to study the time
evolution of the continuum and the outflow. By stacking the observations, we
have also obtained one of the best X-ray and UV spectra of a Seyfert galaxy
ever obtained. In this paper we also study the effects of the spectral energy
distribution (SED) that we obtained on the photo-ionisation equilibrium. Thanks
to our broad-band coverage, uncertainties on the SED do not strongly affect the

derive an accurate relative calibration for the effective area of the RGS,
derive an accurate absolute wavelength calibration, improve the method for
adding time-dependent spectra and enhance the efficiency of the spectral
fitting by two orders of magnitude. We show the major improvement of the
spectral data quality due to the use of the new RGS multi-pointing mode of

allows us to investigate the ionized outflow with an unprecedented accuracy due
to the long exposure and the use of the RGS multipointing mode. We detect
multiple absorption lines from the interstellar medium and from the ionized
absorber in Mrk 509. A number of emission components are also detected,
including broad emission lines consistent with an origin in the broad line
region, the narrow OVII forbidden emission line and also (narrow) radiative
recombination continua. The ionized absorber consists of two velocity
components (v = -13 \pm 11 km/s and v = -319 \pm 14 km/s), which both are
consistent with earlier results, including UV data. There is another tentative
component outflowing at high velocity, -770 \pm 109 km/s, which is only seen in
a few highly ionized absorption lines. The outflow shows discrete ionization
components, spanning four orders of magnitude in ionization parameter. Due to
the excellent statistics of our spectrum, we demonstrate for the first time
that the outflow in Mrk 509 in the important range of log xi between 1-3 cannot
be described by a smooth, continuous absorption measure distribution, but
instead shows two strong, discrete peaks. At the highest and lowest ionization
parameters we cannot differentiate smooth and discrete components.

observations of the Seyfert-1/QSO Mrk 509, part of an unprecedented
multi-wavelength campaign, investigating the nuclear environment of this AGN.
The XMM-Newton data are from a series of 10 observations of about 60 ks each,
spaced from each other by about 4 days, taken in Oct-Nov 2009. During our
campaign, Mrk 509 was also observed with Swift for a period of about 100 days,
monitoring the behaviour of the source before and after the XMM-Newton
observations. With these data we have established the continuum spectrum in the
optical-UV and X-ray bands and investigated its variability on the timescale of
our campaign with a resolution time of a few days. In order to measure and
model the continuum as far as possible into the UV, we also made use of HST/COS
observations of Mrk 509 (part of our coordinated campaign) and of an archival
FUSE observation. We have found that in addition to an X-ray power-law, the
spectrum displays soft X-ray excess emission below 2 keV, which interestingly
varies in association with the thermal optical-UV emission from the accretion
disc. The change in the X-ray power-law component flux (albeit smaller than
that of the soft excess), on the other hand, is uncorrelated to the flux
variability of the soft X-ray excess and the disc component on the probed
timescale. The results of our simultaneous broad-band spectral and timing
analysis suggest that, on a resolution time of a few days, the soft X-ray
excess of Mrk 509 is produced by the Comptonisation of the thermal optical-UV
photons from the accretion disc by a warm (0.2 keV) optically thick (tau ~ 17)
corona surrounding the inner regions of the disc. This makes Mrk 509, with a
black hole mass of about 1-3 x 10^8 solar masses, the highest mass known system
to display such behaviour and origin for the soft X-ray excess.

whether the gas responsible for the UV and X-ray absorption are the same. We
analyzed the LETGS X-ray spectrum of Mrk 509 using the SPEX fitting package. We
detect several absorption features originating in the ionized absorber of the
source, along with resolved emission lines and radiative recombination
continua. The absorption features belong to ions with, at least, three distinct
ionization degrees. The lowest ionized component is slightly redshifted (v =
+73 km/s) and is not in pressure equilibrium with the others, and therefore it
is not likely part of the outflow, possibly belonging to the interstellar
medium of the host galaxy. The other components are outflowing at velocities of
-196 and -455 km/s, respectively. The source was observed simultaneously with
HST-COS, finding 13 UV kinematic components. At least three of them can be
kinematically associated with the observed X-ray components. Based on the
HST-COS results and a previous FUSE observation, we find evidence that the UV
absorbing gas might be co-located with the X-ray absorbing gas and belong to
the same structure.

1155-1760 A of the Seyfert 1 Mrk 509 obtained simultaneously with a
Chandra/LETGS spectrum as part of a multiwavelength campaign in 2009 that
included observations with XMM-Newton, SWIFT, and Integral. Our high S/N
spectrum detects additional complexity in the absorption troughs from a variety
of sources in Mrk 509, including the outflow from the active nucleus, the ISM
and halo of the host galaxy, and infalling clouds or stripped gas from a merger
that are illuminated by the AGN. Variability between the STIS and COS
observation of the -400 km/s component allows us to set an upper limit on its
distance of < 250 pc. Similarly, variability of a component at +150 km/s
between two prior FUSE observations limits its distance to < 1.5 kpc. The UV
absorption only partially covers the emission from the AGN nucleus. Covering
fractions are lower than those previously seen with STIS, and are comparable to
those seen with FUSE. Given the larger apertures of COS and FUSE compared to
STIS, we favor scattered light from an extended region near the AGN as the
explanation for the partial covering. As observed in prior X-ray and UV
spectra, the UV absorption has velocities comparable to the X-ray absorption,
but the bulk of the ultraviolet absorption is in a lower ionization state with
lower total column density than the gas responsible for the X-ray absorption.
We conclude that the outflow from the active nucleus is a multiphase wind.

multi-symbol case, using the variational Bayes (VB) approximation to deal with
the combinatorial complexity of the phase inference in this case. The work
provides a fully Bayesian extension of the EM-based framework underlying
current turbo-synchronization methods, since it induces a von Mises prior on
the time-invariant phase parmeter. As a result, we achieve tractable iterative
algorithms with improved robustness in low SNR regimes, compared to the current
EM-based approaches. As a corollary to our analysis we also discover the
importance of prior regularization in elegantly tackling the significant
problem of phase ambiguity.

how our theoretical underpinnings, based on a metric space and a complete

these two worlds. As an example, we show how the soundness of term graph
