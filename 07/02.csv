high-throughput data is an open issue in modern molecular biology. In this
paper we provide a comparative study of three methods to obtain small sample
and high dimension estimates of partial correlation coefficients: the
Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (PINV), residual correlation (RCM) and
covariance-regularized method $(\ell_{2C})$. We first compare them on simulated
datasets and we find that PINV is less stable in terms of AUC performance when
the number of variables changes. The two regularized methods have comparable
performances but $\ell_{2C}$ is much faster than RCM. Finally, we present the
results of an application of $\ell_{2C}$ for the inference of a gene network
for isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana.

than fifty years. The introduction of the conformal method in the 1970's as a
parameterization of initial data for the Einstein equations led to increased
interest in the development of a complete solution theory for the constraints,
with the theory for constant mean curvature (CMC) spatial slices and closed
manifolds completely developed by 1995. The first general non-CMC existence
result was establish by Holst et al. in 2008, with extensions to rough data by
Holst et al. in 2009, and to vacuum spacetimes by Maxwell in 2009. The non-CMC
theory remains mostly open; moreover, recent work of Maxwell on specific
symmetry models sheds light on fundamental non-uniqueness problems with the
conformal method as a parameterization in non-CMC settings. In parallel with
these mathematical developments, computational physicists have uncovered
surprising behavior in numerical solutions to the extended conformal thin
sandwich formulation of the Einstein constraints. In particular, numerical
evidence suggests the existence of multiple solutions with a quadratic fold,
and a recent analysis of a simplified model supports this conclusion. In this
article, we examine this apparent bifurcation phenomena in a methodical way,
using modern techniques in bifurcation theory and in numerical homotopy
methods. We first review the evidence for the presence of bifurcation in the
Hamiltonian constraint in the time-symmetric case. We give a brief introduction
to the mathematical framework for analyzing bifurcation phenomena, and then
develop the main ideas behind the construction of numerical homotopy, or
path-following, methods in the analysis of bifurcation phenomena. We then apply
the continuation software package AUTO to this problem, and verify the presence
of the fold with homotopy-based numerical methods.

Frequencies are extracted by prewhitening, and their significance is evaluated
under the assumption that the light curve is dominated by red noise. We search
for harmonics, linear combinations and regular spacings among these
frequencies. We use simulations with the same time sampling as the data as a
powerful tool to judge the significance of our results. From the theoretical
point of view, we use the MAD non-adiabatic pulsation code to determine the
expected frequencies of excited modes. A substantial number of frequencies is
listed, but none can be convincingly identified as being connected to
pulsations. The amplitude spectrum is dominated by red noise. Theoretical
modelling shows that all three O-type stars can have excited modes but the
relation between the theoretical frequencies and the observed spectrum is not
obvious. The dominant red noise component in the hot O-type stars studied here
clearly points to a different origin than the pulsations seen in cooler O
stars. The physical cause of this red noise is unclear, but we speculate on the
possibility of sub-surface convection, granulation, or stellar wind

  Algorithm",,,,,"q-bio.QM cond-mat.stat-mech physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, several particle-based stochastic simulation algorithms
(PSSA) have been developed to study the spatially resolved dynamics of
biochemical networks at a molecular scale. A challenge all these approaches
have to address is to allow for simulations at cell-biologically relevant
timescales without neither neglecting important spatial and biochemical
properties of the simulated system nor introducing ad-hoc assumptions not based
on physical principles. Here we describe a PSSA that permits large time steps
while still retaining a high degree of accuracy. The approach addresses the
typical disadvantage of Brownian dynamics, namely the need to use small time
steps to resolve bimolecular encounters accurately, by estimating the number of
otherwise unnoticed encounters with the help of the Green's functions of the
diffusion equation incorporating molecular interactions. This method has
previously been proposed for purely absorbing boundary conditions and
irreversible bimolecular reactions. Building on those ideas, we developed a
general-purpose PSSA that is applicable to a broad class of reaction-diffusion
problems by incorporating reflective and radiation boundary conditions and
reversible reactions. We furthermore discuss how reaction-diffusion systems on
2D membranes can be described and derive small time expansions of the Green's
functions that substantially speed up key calculations, particularly in the
problematic case of molecules in close proximity. Finally, we point out the
formal relationship between our and exact algorithms. The proposed algorithm
may serve as an easily implementable and flexible, computationally efficient,
coarse-grained description of reaction-diffusion systems in 2D and 3D that
nevertheless provides a stochastic, detailed representation at the level of
individual particle trajectories in space and time.

implies that, while the scaled distribution function has been proven in the
literature to converge to the isotropic self-similar solution in well-defined
mathematical terms, nonzero initial anisotropic moments do not decay with time.
On the other hand, our results show that the ratio between an anisotropic
moment and the isotropic moment of the same degree tends to zero.

heliopause has been investigated based on the assumption that interstellar
grains are homogeneous spheres. However, remote observations have shown that
interstellar grains are more likely to be composites of a large number of
subunits. This has profound significance when interpreting data obtained
through in-situ measurements, for the deflection of interstellar grains depends
on their charge-to-mass ratio, and aggregates acquire different surface charges
from spheres due to their complex structure. In this paper, the charging of
aggregates near the heliopause is examined including both plasma charging and
secondary electron emission. The results show that aggregates generally have a
higher charge-to-mass ratio than spheres, and the small particle effect from
secondary electron emission is evident for aggregates consisting of nano-sized
particles. A new approach to estimate the aggregate charge with the aid of its
structural characteristics is presented. The charge-to-mass ratio is used to
derive the mass distribution of interstellar dust near the heliopause, and the
result shows an overall agreement with Ulysses data.

different Majorana modes either directly or through intermediary fermions. To
quantify the rate of loss of the information stored in the Majorana modes we
study the two-time correlators for qubits built from them. We analyze a generic
gapped fermionic environment (bath) interacting via tunneling with different
components of the qubit (different Majorana modes). We find that static
(time-independent) perturbations are not harmful, and just lead to a depletion
of the information stored that saturates in the long-time limit. On the other
hand we find markedly different results for dynamic (time dependent) systems,
with no coherence surviving in the long time limit. In particular we find that
dephasing and energy fluctuations of the modes in the fermionic bath have
adverse effects on the Majorana memories.

manner. Marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disks, of the type required
to form gas giant planets, are capable of rapid homogenization of isotopic
heterogeneity as well as of rapid radial transport of dust grains and gases
throughout a protoplanetary disk. Two different types of new models of a MGU
disk in orbit around a solar-mass protostar are presented. The first set has
variations in the number of terms in the spherical harmonic solution for the
gravitational potential, effectively studying the effect of varying the spatial
resolution of the gravitational torques responsible for MGU disk evolution. The
second set explores the effects of varying the initial minimum value of the
Toomre $Q$ stability parameter, from values of 1.4 to 2.5, i.e., toward
increasingly less unstable disks. The new models show that the basic results
are largely independent of both sets of variations. MGU disk models robustly
result in rapid mixing of initially highly heterogeneous distributions of SLRIs
to levels of $\sim$ 10% in both the inner ($<$ 5 AU) and outer ($>$ 10 AU) disk
regions, and to even lower levels ($\sim$ 2%) in intermediate regions, where
gravitational torques are most effective at mixing. These gradients should have
cosmochemical implications for the distribution of SLRIs and stable oxygen
isotopes contained in planetesimals (e.g., comets) formed in the giant planet

disorder on the statistics of cracking for a thin layer of material under
uniform and isotropic drying. The layer is discretized into a triangular
lattice of springs. The drying process is captured by reducing the natural
length of all springs by the same factor, and the amount of quenched disorder
is controlled by varying the width {\xi} of the distribution of the random
breaking thresholds for the springs. Once a spring breaks, redistribution of
the load may trigger an avalanche of breaks. Our simulations revealed that the
system exhibits a phase transition with the amount of disorder as control
parameter: at low disorders, the breaking process is dominated by a macroscopic
crack at the beginning, and the size distribution of the subsequent breaking
avalanches shows an exponential form. At high disorders, the fracturing
proceeds in small-sized avalanches with an exponential distribution, generating
a large number of micro-cracks which eventually merge and break the layer.
Between both phases a sharp transition occurs at a critical amount of disorder
{\xi}_c = 0.40 \pm 0.01, where the avalanche size distribution becomes a power
law with exponent {\tau} = 2.6 \pm 0.08, in agreement with the mean-field value
{\tau} = 5/2 of the fiber bundle model. Good quality data collapses from the
finite-size scaling analysis show that the average value of the largest burst
<\Delta_max> can be identified as the order parameter, with {\beta}/{\nu} = 1.4
and 1/{\nu} = 1.0, and that the average ratio <m2 /m1> of the second m2 and
first moments m1 of the avalanche size distribution shows similar behaviour to
the susceptibility of a continuous transition, with {\gamma}/{\nu} = 1.,
1/{\nu} = 0.9. These suggest that the disorder induced transition of the

  welcome",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It
gives rise to peculiar correlations which cannot be reproduced by a large class
of alternative theories, the so-called hidden-variable models, that use
parameters in addition to the wave-function. This incompatibility was
quantified through the celebrated Bell inequalities, and more recently through
new inequalities due to Leggett. Experiments confirm the predictions of quantum
mechanics. However, this does not imply that quantum mechanics is the ultimate
theory, unsusceptible of improvement, nor that quantum mechanics is essentially
non-local. The theories ruled out by Bell and Leggett inequalities are required
to satisfy some hypotheses, none of which is implied by locality alone. By
dropping one or more hypotheses, it is possible not only to violate said
inequalities, but to reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions altogether.
So far, the models proposed were only mathematical constructs. In this paper we
provide a classical realization of two of these models, using local classical
resources, without recurring to any type of communication among the involved
parties. The resources consist in two baseballs, two bats, and a number of
synchronized watches. Our results demonstrate the possibility of reproducing
the quantum mechanical correlations, and even creating stronger correlations
which provide the maximum violation of the Bell inequality, beyond the
Cirel'son bound for quantum mechanics.

find three possible models for the Beta Leo (HD102647) debris disc: (i) A 2
component model, comprised of a hot component at 2 AU and a cold component from
15-70 AU. (ii) A 3 component model with hot dust at 2 AU, warm dust at 9 AU,
and a cold component from 30-70 AU, is equally valid since the cold emission is
not resolved within 30 AU. (iii) A somewhat less likely possibility is that the
system consists of a single very eccentric planetesimal population, with
pericentres at 2 AU and apocentres at 65 AU. Thus, despite the wealth of
observational constraints significant ambiguities remain; deep mid-IR and
scattered light imaging of the dust distribution within 30 AU seems the most
promising method to resolve the degeneracy. We discuss the implications for the
possible planetary system architecture; e.g., the 2 component model suggests
planets may exist at 2-15 AU, while the 3 component model suggests planets
between 2-30 AU with a stable region containing the dust belt at 9 AU, and
there should be no planets between 2-65 AU in the eccentric planetesimal model.
We suggest that the hot dust may originate in the disintegration of comets
scattered in from the cold disc, and examine all A stars known to harbour both
hot and cold dust to consider the possibility that the ratio of hot and cold
dust luminosities is indicative of the intervening planetary system
architecture.

Structural measurements for all but the z~0.1 galaxies were based on HST

indicators. We find that a correlation between the structure and stellar
population of galaxies (i.e., a 'Hubble sequence') is already in place since at
least z~2.5. At all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequence
are well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescent
galaxies are better described by de Vaucouleurs profiles. In the upper envelope
of the main sequence, the relation between the SFR and Sersic index reverses,
suggesting a rapid build-up of the central mass concentration in these
starbursting outliers. We observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-forming
systems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. At each
mass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. The
rate of size growth correlates with specific SFR, and so does \Sigma_SFR at
each redshift. A simple model using an empirically determined SF law and
metallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and stars

photosynthetic light-harvesting systems is identified using an analytically
soluble model. Three physical features are found to be responsible for their
long coherence lifetimes: i) the small energy gap between excitonic states, ii)
the small ratio of the energy gap to the coupling between excitonic states, and
iii) the fact that the molecular characteristics place the system in an
effective low temperature regime, even at ambient conditions. Using this
approach, we obtain decoherence times for a dimer model with FMO parameters of
$\approx$ 160 fs at 77 K and $\approx$ 80 fs at 277 K. As such, significant
oscillations are found to persist for 600 fs and 300 fs, respectively, in
accord with the experiment and with previous computations. Similar good
agreement is found for PC645 at room temperature, with oscillations persisting
for 400 fs. The analytic expressions obtained provide direct insight into the
parameter dependence of the decoherence time scales.

means that the interval (0,1] does not contain any eigenvalues of L_{+-} and
that the threshold 1 is neither an eigenvalue nor a resonance. The gap property
is required in order to prove scattering to the ground states for solutions
starting on the center-stable manifold associated with these states. This paper
therefore provides the final installment in the proof of this scattering

model the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with a spatially periodic nonlinear
coefficient. An asymptotic theory is developed for long solitary waves, that
span a large number of lattice periods. In this limit, the allowed positions of
solitary waves relative to the lattice, as well as their linear stability
properties, hinge upon a certain recurrence relation which contains information
beyond all orders of the usual two-scale perturbation expansion. It follows
that only two such positions are permissible, and of those two solitary waves,
one is linearly stable and the other unstable. For a cosine lattice, in
particular, the two possible solitary waves are centered at a maximum or
minimum of the lattice, with the former being stable, and the analytical
predictions for the associated linear stability eigenvalues are in excellent
agreement with numerical results. Furthermore, a countable set of
multi-solitary-wave bound states are constructed analytically. In spite of
rather different physical settings, the exponential asymptotics approach
followed here is strikingly similar to that taken in earlier studies of
solitary wavepackets involving a periodic carrier and a slowly-varying
envelope, which underscores the general value of this procedure for treating
multi-scale solitary-wave problems.

currents (conserved or not) and symmetries of the electromagnetism. In fact,
the main result of the present work is that the non-conservation of the spin
current is associated to the gauge invariance of physical observables where the

their result by including the electromagnetic field as a dynamical field

is defined by a depletion of states lying energetically between folded and

generalized-ensemble computer simulations allow to unambiguously identify this
transition by a microcanonical analysis on the basis of the density of states.
Here we perform a detailed characterization of several helical peptides using
coarse-grained simulations. The level of resolution of the coarse-grained model
allows to study realistic structures ranging from small alpha-helices to a de
novo three-helix bundle - without biasing the force field toward the native
state of the protein. Linking thermodynamic and structural features shows that
while short alpha-helices exhibit two-state cooperativity, the type of
transition changes for longer chain lengths because the chain forms multiple
helix nucleation sites, stabilizing a significant population of intermediate
states. The helix bundle exhibits the signs of two-state cooperativity owing to
favorable helix-helix interactions, as predicted from theoretical models. The
detailed analysis of secondary and tertiary structure formation fits well into
the framework of several folding mechanisms and confirms features observed so

rotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral
type, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171
stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has been
observed before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type
stars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,
and typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies
with all kinds of periodicities within the gamma Dor and delta Sct range, also
between 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. We find
indications for the existence of delta Sct and gamma Dor stars beyond the edges
of the current observational instability strips. The hybrid stars occupy the
entire region within the delta Sct and gamma Dor instability strips, and
beyond. Non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. The
location of gamma Dor and delta Sct classes in the (Teff,logg)-diagram has been
extended. We investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and
'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma Dor and delta Sct

sharper bounds, and is designed also to combine well with base field descent

uncertainty in determining the renormalization scale $\mu$ of the running
coupling $\alpha_s(\mu^2).$ The purpose of the running coupling in any gauge
theory is to sum all terms involving the $\beta$ function; in fact, when the
renormalization scale is set properly, all non-conformal $\beta \ne 0$ terms in
a perturbative expansion arising from renormalization are summed into the
running coupling. The remaining terms in the perturbative series are then
identical to that of a conformal theory; i.e., the corresponding theory with
$\beta=0$. The resulting scale-fixed predictions using the ""principle of
maximum conformality"" (PMC) are independent of the choice of renormalization
scheme -- a key requirement of renormalization group invariance. The results
avoid renormalon resummation and agree with QED scale-setting in the Abelian
limit. The PMC is also the theoretical principle underlying the BLM procedure,
commensurate scale relations between observables, and the scale-setting method
used in lattice gauge theory. The number of active flavors $n_f$ in the QCD
$\beta$ function is also correctly determined. We discuss several methods for
determining the PMC scale for QCD processes. We show that a single global PMC
scale, valid at leading order, can be derived from basic properties of the
perturbative QCD cross section. The elimination of the renormalization scale
ambiguity and the scheme dependence using the PMC will not only increase the
precision of QCD tests, but it will also increase the sensitivity of collider
experiments to new physics beyond the Standard Model.

from these observatories are largest for the VLT followed by Keck, Gemini,

telescopes are largest for Keck followed by VLT, Subaru, Gemini, and HET. In
2009, each telescope of the Keck, VLT, Gemini, Subaru, and HET observatories
produced 135, 109, 93, 107, and 5 refereed papers, respectively. We have shown
that each telescope of the Keck, VLT, Gemini, and Subaru observatories is

+/- 0.8 %. Extending this relation, we propose that this ratio of the number of
Nature and Science papers over the number of whole refereed papers that will be
produced by future extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will be remained similar.
From the comparison of the publication trends of the above telescopes, we
suggest that (i) having more than one telescope of the same kind at the same

\textbf{77}, 022113(2008)], a subclass of PPT states so-called strong positive
partial transposition (SPPT) states was introduced and it was conjectured there
that SPPT states are separable. However, it was illustrated with examples in
[Phys. Rev. A \textbf{81}, 064101(2010)] that this conjecture is not true.
Viewing the original SPPT as SPPT up to part B, in the present paper, we define
SPPT state up to part A and B respectively and present a separable class of
SPPT states, that is the super SPPT (SSPPT) states, in terms of local
commutativity. In addition, classical-quantum (CQ) states and nullity of MiN
are characterized via local commutativity. Based on CQ states, the geometric
measure of quantum discord (GMQD) for infinite-dimensional case is proposed.
Consequently, we highlight the relation among MiN, QD(GMQD), SSPPT and
separability through a unified approach for both finite- and
infinite-dimensional systems: zero MiN implies zero QD(GMQD), zero QD(GMQD)
signals SSPPT and SSPPT guarantees separability, but the converses are not

spatial domains that are typically Riemannian manifolds rather than simply open

positive solutions typically have meaning. This creates additional complexities

cross-ratio, {Europ. J. Combin.}, 22 (2001) 297-301], de Caen and van Dam
constructed a fission scheme $\FT(q+1)$ of the triangular scheme on $\PG(1,q)$.
This fission scheme comes from the naturally induced action of $\PGL(2,q)$ on
the 2-element subsets of $\PG(1,q)$. The group $\PGL(2,q)$ is one of two
infinite families of finite sharply 3-transitive groups. The other such family
$\Mq(q)$ is a ""twisted"" version of $\PGL(2,q)$, where $q$ is an even power of
an odd prime. The group $\PSL(2,q)$ is the intersection of $\PGL(2,q)$ and
$\Mq(q)$. In this paper, we investigate the association schemes coming from the
actions of $\PSL(2,q)$, $\Mq(q)$ and $\PML(2,q)$, respectively. Through the
conic model introduced in [H.D.L. Hollmann, Q. Xiang. Association schemes from
the actions of $\PGL(2, q) $ fixing a nonsingular conic, {J. Algebraic
Combin.}, 24 (2006) 157-193], we introduce an embedding of $\PML(2,q)$ into
$\PML(3,q)$. For each of the three groups mentioned above, this embedding
produces two more isomorphic association schemes: one on hyperbolic lines and
the other on hyperbolic points (via a null parity) in a 3-dimensional
orthogonal geometry. This embedding enables us to treat these three isomorphic
association schemes simultaneously.

base and the K3 fibre, we demand also the existence of two additional rigid
divisors: the first supporting the non-perturbative effects needed to achieve
moduli stabilisation, and the second allowing the presence of chiral matter on
wrapped D-branes. We clarify the topology of these rigid divisors by discussing
the interplay between a diagonal structure of the Calabi-Yau volume and
D-terms. Del Pezzo divisors appearing in the volume form in a completely
diagonal way are natural candidates for supporting non-perturbative effects and
for quiver constructions, while `non-diagonal' del Pezzo and rigid but not del
Pezzo divisors are particularly interesting for model building in the geometric
regime. Searching through the existing list of four dimensional reflexive
lattice polytopes, we find 158 examples admitting a Calabi-Yau hypersurface
which is a K3 fibration with four K\""ahler moduli where at least one of them is
a `diagonal' del Pezzo. We work out explicitly the topological details of a few
examples showing how, in the case of simplicial polytopes, all the del Pezzo
divisors are `diagonal', while `non-diagonal' ones appear only in the case of
non-simplicial polytopes. A companion paper will use these results in the study
of moduli stabilisation for globally consistent explicit Calabi-Yau

which led to a deeper understanding of the random displacement model, a model
of a random Schr\""odinger operator which describes the quantum mechanics of an
electron in a structurally disordered medium. These results started by
identifying configurations which characterize minimal energy, then led to
Lifshitz tail bounds on the integrated density of states as well as a Wegner
estimate near the spectral minimum, which ultimately resulted in a proof of
spectral and dynamical localization at low energy for the multi-dimensional
random displacement model.

  of nanomagnets with low-saturation magnetization in the presence of thermal
  fluctuations",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A common ploy to reduce the switching current and energy dissipation in
spin-transfer-torque driven magnetization switching of shape-anisotropic
single-domain nanomagnets is to employ magnets with low saturation
magnetization $M_s$ and high shape-anisotropy. The high shape-anisotropy
compensates for low $M_s$ to keep the static switching error rate constant.
However, this ploy increases the switching delay, its variance in the presence
of thermal noise, and the dynamic switching error rate. Using the stochastic
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a random torque emulating thermal noise,
we show that pumping some excess spin-polarized current into the nanomagnet
during switching will keep the mean switching delay and its variance constant
as we reduce $M_s$, while still reducing the energy dissipation significantly.

isotropic expansion but anisotropic curvature. The perturbed Einstein equation
and Boltzmann equations for massless and massive particles are derived in a
general gauge and a decomposition of perturbations into harmonic modes and

also present in the background is discussed.

n receivers R_1,...,R_n. Every receiver has some side information on x
consisting of a subset of the characters of x. The side information of the
receivers is represented by a graph G on n vertices in which {i,j} is an edge
if R_i knows x_j. In the index coding problem the goal is to encode x using a
minimum number of characters in F in a way that enables every R_i to retrieve
the ith character x_i using the encoded message and the side information. An
index code is linear if the encoding is linear, and in this case the minimum
possible length is known to be equal to a graph parameter called minrank
(Bar-Yossef et al., FOCS'06). Several bounds on the minimum length of an index
code for side information graphs G were shown in the study of index coding.
However, the minimum length of an index code for the random graph G(n,p) is far
from being understood. In this paper we initiate the study of the typical
minimum length of a linear index code for G(n,p) over a field F. First, we
prove that for every constant size field F and a constant p, the minimum length
of a linear index code for G(n,p) over F is almost surely Omega(\sqrt{n}).
Second, we introduce and study the following two restricted models of index
coding: 1. A locally decodable index code is an index code in which the
receivers are allowed to query at most q characters from the encoded message.
2. A low density index code is a linear index code in which every character of
the word x affects at most q characters in the encoded message. Equivalently,
it is a linear code whose generator matrix has at most q nonzero entries in
each row.
