magnetic materials, in particular their hardness and switching behavior, it
represents an essential ingredient of spintronics. Common domain walls are of
Bloch and Neel types in which the magnetization rotates around a fixed axis,
giving rise to a one-dimensional magnetization profile. Domain walls in helical
magnets, most relevant in multiferroics, were never studied systematically.
Here we show that domain walls in helical magnets are fundamentally different
from Bloch and Neel walls. They are generically characterized by a
two-dimensional pattern formed by a regular lattice of vortex singularities. In
conical phases vortices carry Berry phase flux giving rise to the anomalous
Hall effect. In multiferroics vortices are charged, allowing to manipulate
magnetic domain walls by electric fields. Our theory allows the interpretation
of magnetic textures observed in helical magnetic structures.

considered by Fisher, when the magnetic field is set to zero. Limiting
distributions of Lee-Yang and of Fisher zeros are physically important as they
control phase transitions in the model. One can also consider the zeros of the
partition function simultaneously in both complex magnetic field and complex

Diamond Hierarchical Lattice (DHL). In this case, it can be described in terms
of the dynamics of an explicit rational function R in two variables (the

Fatou and Julia sets of this transformation and then we prove that the
Lee-Yang-Fisher zeros are equidistributed with respect to a dynamical

interpreted as the pluripotential of this current. We also prove a more general
equidistribution theorem which applies to rational mappings having

using the Ambegaokar-Halperin (AH) theory in the context of thermal activation.
""Enhanced"" fluctuations, demonstrated by broadening of current-voltage
characteristics, have previously been found for proximity Josephson junctions.
Here we report measurements of micron-scale normal metal loops contacted with
thin superconducting electrodes, where the unconventional loop geometry enables
tuning of the junction barrier with applied flux; for some geometries, the
barrier can be effectively eliminated. Stronger fluctuations are observed when
the flux threading the normal metal loop is near an odd half-integer flux
quantum, and for devices with thinner superconducting electrodes. These
findings suggest that the activation barrier, which is the Josephson coupling
energy of the proximity junction, is different from that of conventional
Josephson junctions. Simple one dimensional quasiclassical theory can predict
the interference effect due to the loop structure, but the exact magnitude of
the coupling energy cannot be computed without taking into account the details
of the sample dimensions. In this way, the physics of this system is similar to
the phase slipping process in thin superconducting wires. Besides shedding
light on thermal fluctuations in proximity junctions, the findings here also
demonstrate a new type of superconducting interference device with two normal
branches sharing the same SN interface on both sides of the device, which has
technical advantages for making symmetrical interference devices.

Each relay is associated with a reward that summarizes the benefit of
forwarding the packet through that relay. We seek a solution to this local
problem, the idea being that such a solution, if adopted by every node, could
provide a reasonable heuristic for the end-to-end forwarding problem. Towards
this end, we propose a relay selection problem comprising a forwarding node and
a collection of relay nodes, with the relays waking up sequentially at random
times. At each relay wake-up instant the forwarder can choose to probe a relay
to learn its reward value, based on which the forwarder can then decide whether
to stop (and forward its packet to the chosen relay) or to continue to wait for
further relays to wake-up. The forwarder's objective is to select a relay so as
to minimize a combination of waiting-delay, reward and probing cost. Our
problem can be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem studied in
the operations research literature. We formulate our relay selection problem as
a Markov decision process (MDP) and obtain some interesting structural results
on the optimal policy (namely, the threshold and the stage-independence
properties). We also conduct simulation experiments and gain valuable insights

derivatives is known to be a standard problem in inverse theory. Such and
similar problems routinely arise in numerous areas of applied sciences,
including optical imaging, laser interferometry, computer vision, remote
sensing and control. Though being ill-posed in nature, the above problem can be
solved in a unique and stable manner, provided proper regularization and
relevant boundary conditions. In this paper, however, a more challenging setup
is addressed, in which one has to recover an image of interest from its noisy
and blurry version, while the only information available about the imaging
system at hand is the amplitude of the generalized pupil function (GPF) along
with partial observations of the gradient of GPF's phase. In this case, the
phase-related information is collected using a simplified version of the
Shack-Hartmann interferometer, followed by recovering the entire phase by means
of derivative compressed sensing. Subsequently, the estimated phase can be
combined with the amplitude of the GPF to produce an estimate of the point
spread function (PSF), whose knowledge is essential for subsequent image
deconvolution. In summary, the principal contribution of this work is twofold.
First, we demonstrate how to simplify the construction of the Shack-Hartmann
interferometer so as to make it less expensive and hence more accessible.
Second, it is shown by means of numerical experiments that the above
simplification and its associated solution scheme produce image reconstructions
of the quality comparable to those obtained using dense sampling of the GPF
phase.

analysis of the said problem has been presented. The analysis involves the
application of a suitable perturbation technique. The velocity profile and the
critical pressure for the occurrence of reflux are investigated with particular
emphasis by using appropriate numerical methods. The effects of various
parameters, such as Reynolds number, pressure gradient, porosity parameter,
Darcy number, slip parameter, amplitude ratio and wave number on velocity and
critical pressure for reflux are investigated in detail. The computed results
are compared with a previous analytical work and an experimental investigation
reported earlier in existing scientific literatures. The results of the present
study are in conformity to both of them. The study has got some relevance to
the physiological flow of bile in the common bile duct in a pathological state.
It reveals that in the presence of gallstones, bile velocity increases as the
value of the porosity parameter increases, while the critical pressure for
reflux decreases as porosity increases.

never vanishes and, as $t\to\infty$, we recover the classical expression for
the scale factor. In this paper, we show that such universes can be reproduced

then show that this single fluid with an implict EoS is equivalent to two

quantum mechanics changes completely the configuration of matter for small

density. As time passes, the density of negative energy decreases and we
recover the ordinary content of the classical universe. The more the initial
wave function of the universe is concentrated around the classical big bang
singularity, the more it is necessary to add negative energy, since this type
of energy will be responsible for the removal of the classical singularity.

regions of the linear density field collapse to form haloes of mass $M$ at
redshift $z_{\rm id}$ if their linearly extrapolated density contrast, averaged
on that scale, exceeds some critical threshold, $\delta_{\rm c}(z_{\rm id})$.
The value of $\delta_{\rm c}(z_{\rm id})$ is often calculated from the
spherical or ellipsoidal collapse model, which provide well-defined predictions
given auxiliary properties of the tidal field at a given location. We use two
cosmological simulations of structure growth in a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter
scenario to quantify $\delta_{\rm c}(z_{\rm id})$, its dependence on the
surrounding tidal field, as well as on the shapes of the Lagrangian regions
that collapse to form haloes at $z_{\rm id}$. Our results indicate that the
ellipsoidal collapse model provides an accurate description of the mean
dependence of $\delta_{\rm c}(z_{\rm id})$ on both the strength of the tidal
field and on halo mass. However, for a given $z_{\rm id}$, $\delta_{\rm
c}(z_{\rm id})$ depends strongly on the halo's characteristic formation
redshift: the earlier a halo forms, the higher its initial density contrast.
Surprisingly, the majority of haloes forming $today$ fall below the ellipsoidal
collapse barrier, contradicting the model predictions. We trace the origin of
this effect to the non-spherical shapes of Lagrangian haloes, which arise
naturally due to the asymmetry of the linear tidal field. We show that a
modified collapse model, that accounts for the triaxial shape of protohaloes,
provides a more accurate description of the measured minimum overdensities of
recently collapsed objects.

tune the distribution of conserved quantities to approach the one in thermal

a large number of sub-regions which move in random directions with relativistic
speeds. We consider two versions of this ""jets in a jet"" model. In the first,
the ""subjets"" model, stationary regions in the mean jet frame emit relativistic
subjets that produce the observed radiation. The variability time scale is
determined by the size of the sub-regions in the mean jet frame. This model,
which is motivated by magnetic reconnection, has great difficulty explaining
the observations in PKS 2155-304. In the alternate ""turbulence"" model, various
sub-regions move relativistically in random directions and the variability time
scale is determined by the size of these regions in their own comoving frames.
This model fits the data much more comfortably. We consider collisions between
TeV photons emitted from different sub-regions and find that, in both the

using high quality observational data. Abundances relative to solar are
obtained for 25 elements with a mean error of 0.023 dex. The fact that 16CygA
has about four times more lithium than 16CygB is normal considering the
slightly different masses of the stars. The abundance patterns of 16CygA and B,
relative to iron, are typical of that observed in most of the so-called solar
twin stars, with the exception of the heavy elements (Z>30), which can,
however, be explained by Galactic chemical evolution. Differential (A-B)
abundances are measured with even higher precision (0.018 dex, on average). We
find that 16CygA is more metal-rich than 16CygB by 0.041+/-0.007 dex. On an
element-to-element basis, no correlation between the A-B abundance differences
and dust condensation temperature (Tc) is detected. Based on these results, we
conclude that if the process of planet formation around 16CygB is responsible
for the observed abundance pattern, the formation of gas giants produces a
constant downwards shift in the photospheric abundance of metals, without a Tc
correlation. The latter would be produced by the formation of terrestrial
planets instead, as suggested by other recent works on precise elemental
abundances. Nevertheless, a scenario consistent with these observations
requires the convective envelopes of 1 Msun stars to reach their present-day

Brans-Dicke parameter, and potential determined by the renormalization group
equation. The theory may be reformulated as an $f(R)$ theory. In the simplest
cosmological scenario, we find large--field inflationary solutions near the
Planck scale where the effective field theory description breaks down. Finally,
we discuss the implications of a running gravitational constant to background
dynamics via cosmological perturbation theory. We show that compatibility with
General Relativity requires contributions from the running gravitational
constant to the stress energy tensor to be taken into account in the
perturbation analysis.

leading order this leads to manifest decoupling of soft and collinear degrees

protostellar hot cores. Detections toward low-mass protostars and outflows are
comparatively rare, and a larger sample is key to investigate how the chemistry
responds to its environment. Guided by the prediction that complex organic
molecules form in CH3OH-rich ices and thermally or non-thermally evaporate with
CH3OH, we have identified three sight-lines in the Serpens core - SMM1, SMM4
and SMM4-W - which are likely to be rich in complex organics. Using the IRAM
30m telescope, narrow lines (FWHM of 1-2 km s-1) of CH3CHO and CH3OCH3 are
detected toward all sources, HCOOCH3 toward SMM1 and SMM4-W, and C2H5OH not at
all. Beam-averaged abundances of individual complex organics range between 0.6
and 10% with respect to CH3OH when the CH3OH rotational temperature is applied.
The summed complex organic abundances also vary by an order of magnitude, with
the richest chemistry toward the most luminous protostar SMM1. The range of
abundances compare well with other beam-averaged observations of low-mass
sources. Complex organic abundances are of the same order of magnitude toward
low-mass protostars and high-mass hot cores, but HCOOCH3 is relatively more
important toward low-mass protostars. This is consistent with a sequential ice
photochemistry, dominated by CHO-containing products at low temperatures and
early times.

to 80% of the available oxygen and carbon. In this paper, we use the Spitzer
c2d ice survey, complimented with data sets on ices in cloud cores and
high-mass protostars, to determine standard ice abundances and to present a
coherent picture of the evolution of ices during low- and high-mass star
formation. The median ice composition H2O:CO:CO2:CH3OH:NH3:CH4:XCN is
100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-mass
protostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. In the low-mass
sample, the ice abundances with respect to H2O of CH4, NH3, and the component
of CO2 mixed with H2O typically vary by <25%, indicative of co-formation with
H2O. In contrast, some CO and CO2 ice components, XCN and CH3OH vary by factors
2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. The XCN band correlates with CO,
consistent with its OCN- identification. The origin(s) of the different levels
of ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories toward
different types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping,
analysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. Based on
the analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation of
atoms, which results in a H2O-dominated ice. At later prestellar times, CO
freezes out and variations in CO freeze-out levels and the subsequent CO-based
chemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. The last
important ice evolution stage is thermal and UV processing around protostars,
resulting in CO desorption, ice segregation and formation of complex organic
molecules. The distribution of cometary ice abundances are consistent with with
the idea that most cometary ices have a protostellar origin.

most common ice constituents - H2O, CO2 and CO - are second in abundance only
to H2 in many star forming regions. In addition to being a molecular reservoir,
ice chemistry is responsible for much of the chemical evolution from H2O to
complex, prebiotic molecules. Combining the existing ISO, Spitzer, VLT and Keck
ice data results in a large sample of ice sources (\sime80) that span all
stages of star formation and a large range of protostellar luminosities
(<0.1-105 L\odot). Here we summarize the different techniques that have been
applied to mine this ice data set on information on typical ice compositions in
different environments and what this implies about how ices form and evolve
during star and planet formation. The focus is on how to maximize the use of
empirical constraints from ice observations, followed by the application of
information from experiments and models. This strategy is used to identify ice
bands and to constrain which ices form early during cloud formation, which form
later in the prestellar core and which require protostellar heat and/or UV
radiation to form. The utility of statistical tests, survival analysis and ice
maps is highlighted; the latter directly reveals that the prestellar ice
formation takes place in two phases, associated with H2O and CO ice formation,
respectively, and that most protostellar ice variation can be explained by
differences in the prestellar CO ice formation stage. Finally, special
attention is paid to the difficulty of observing complex ices directly and how
gas observations, experiments and models help in constraining this ice
chemistry stage.

large tunnel couplings t. A Zeeman field B is used to tune the energy
difference of singlet and triplet spin configurations. Attaching this geometry
to BCS source and drain leads with gap Delta and phase difference phi gives
rise to an equilibrium supercurrent J. To compute J in presence of Coulomb
interactions U between the dot electrons, we employ the functional
renormalization group (FRG). For B\simt -- where the singlet and lowest-lying
triplet spin states are equal in energy -- the current exhibits characteristics
of a 0-pi transition similar to a single impurity. Its magnitude in the pi
phase, however, jumps discontinuously at B=t, being smaller on the triplet
side. Exploiting the flexibility of the FRG, we demonstrate that this effect is
generic and calculate J for realistic experimental parameters Delta, U, and
gate voltages epsilon. To obtain a more thorough understanding of the
discontinuity, we analytically treat the limit Delta=infty where one can access
the exact many-particle states. Finally, carrying out perturbation theory in
the dot-lead couplings substantiates the intuitive picture that Cooper pair
tunneling is favored by a singlet spin configuration while inhibited by a
triplet one.

theory, but the analogy as it has been developed so far is not complete.
Whereas the manner in which inferences are made in classical probability theory
is independent of the causal relation that holds between the conditioned
variable and the conditioning variable, in the conventional quantum formalism,
there is a significant difference between how one treats experiments involving
two systems at a single time and those involving a single system at two times.
In this article, we develop the formalism of quantum conditional states, which
provides a unified description of these two sorts of experiment. In addition,
concepts that are distinct in the conventional formalism become unified:
channels, sets of states, and positive operator valued measures are all seen to
be instances of conditional states; the action of a channel on a state,
ensemble averaging, the Born rule, the composition of channels, and
nonselective state-update rules are all seen to be instances of belief
propagation. Using a quantum generalization of Bayes' theorem and the
associated notion of Bayesian conditioning, we also show that the remote
steering of quantum states can be described within our formalism as a mere
updating of beliefs about one system given new information about another, and
retrodictive inferences can be expressed using the same belief propagation rule
as is used for predictive inferences. Finally, we show that previous arguments
for interpreting the projection postulate as a quantum generalization of
Bayesian conditioning are based on a misleading analogy and that it is best
understood as a combination of belief propagation (corresponding to the
nonselective state-update map) and conditioning on the measurement outcome.

background modeling method, to generate the weight image and we calculate
contributions of the classifiers dynamically using their confidences to
generate a final weight image to be used in tracking. The contributions of the
classifiers are calculated by using correlations between histograms of their
weight images and histogram of a defined ideal weight image in the previous
frame. We show with experiments that our dynamic combination scheme selects
good contributions for classifiers for different cases and improves tracking
accuracy significantly.

for example, in single-atom metallic contacts the number of transmission
channels is also the chemical valence of the atom. Recently, highly conductive
single-molecule junctions (SMJ) with multiple transport channels have been
formed from benzene molecules between Pt electrodes. Transport through these
multi-channel SMJs is a probe of both the bonding properties at the
lead-molecule interface and of the molecular symmetry.
  Here we utilize a many-body theory that properly describes the complementary
nature of the charge carrier to calculate transport distributions through
Pt-benzene-Pt junctions. We develop an effective field theory of interacting
pi-electrons to accurately model the electrostatic influence of the leads and
an ab initio tunneling model to describe the lead-molecule bonding. With this
state-of-the-art many-body technique we calculate the transport using the full
molecular spectrum and using an `isolated resonance approximation' for the
molecular Green's function.
  We confirm that the number of transmission channels in a SMJ is equal to the
degeneracy of the relevant molecular orbital. In addition, we demonstrate that
the isolated resonance approximation is extremely accurate and determine that
transport occurs predominantly via the HOMO orbital in Pt-benzene-Pt junctions.
Finally, we show that the transport occurs in a lead-molecule coupling regime
where the charge carriers are both particle-like and wave-like simultaneously,
requiring a many-body description.

mainly by the average matter density, with small but non-negligible
contribution from the real part of the first Fourier mode. We also find that
the sensitivity of the T2KK experiment on the neutrino mass hierarchy does not
improve significantly by reducing the matter density error from 6% to 3%, since
the measurement is limited by statistics for the minimum scenario of T2KK with
SK at Kamioka anda 100 kt detector in Korea considered in this report. The
sensitivity of the T2KK experiment on the neutrino mass hierarchy improves
significantly by splitting the total beam time into neutrino and anti-neutrino
runs, because the matter effect term contributes to the oscillation amplitudes
with the opposite sign.

  analyticity conditions",,,,,"math.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A spectral theory of linear operators on rigged Hilbert spaces (Gelfand
triplets) is developed under the assumptions that a linear operator $T$ on a
Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is a perturbation of a selfadjoint operator, and
the spectral measure of the selfadjoint operator has an analytic continuation
near the real axis in some sense. It is shown that there exists a dense
subspace $X$ of $\mathcal{H}$ such that the resolvent $(\lambda -T)^{-1}\phi$
of the operator $T$ has an analytic continuation from the lower half plane to
the upper half plane as an $X'$-valued holomorphic function for any $\phi \in
X$, even when $T$ has a continuous spectrum on $\mathbf{R}$, where $X'$ is a
dual space of $X$. The rigged Hilbert space consists of three spaces $X \subset
\mathcal{H} \subset X'$. A generalized eigenvalue and a generalized
eigenfunction in $X'$ are defined by using the analytic continuation of the
resolvent as an operator from $X$ into $X'$. Other basic tools of the usual
spectral theory, such as a spectrum, resolvent, Riesz projection and semigroup
are also studied in terms of a rigged Hilbert space. They prove to have the
same properties as those of the usual spectral theory. The results are applied
to estimate asymptotic behavior of solutions of evolution equations.

to introduce loglinear models for dependency among neurons, but previous use of

triplet representations. The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the
left-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass
terms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light
neutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible
to have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate
the seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is
constrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa
couplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also
find that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of
leptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and quadruplet Higgs
representations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a
phenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive
sizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels. Large Yukawa couplings
of the quadruplet can induce observable effects for lepton flavor violating
processes $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\mu - e$ conversion. Implications of the
recent $\mu \to e\gamma$ limit from MEG and also limit on $\mu - e $ conversion

of the spin-wave disperion in the AFM ordered state of

spin-wave theory yields a perfect description of the experimental dispersion.
Furthermore, magnetic excitations in the ferromagnetic metallic state of

are of critical importance because of regulatory requirements that marketed
doses are safe and provide clinically relevant efficacy. Motivated by a
dose-finding study in moderate persistent asthma, we propose response-adaptive
designs addressing two major challenges in dose-finding studies: uncertainty
about the dose-response models and large variability in parameter estimates. To
allocate new cohorts of patients in an ongoing study, we use optimal designs
that are robust under model uncertainty. In addition, we use a Bayesian
shrinkage approach to stabilize the parameter estimates over the successive
interim analyses used in the adaptations. This approach allows us to calculate
updated parameter estimates and model probabilities that can then be used to
calculate the optimal design for subsequent cohorts. The resulting designs are
hence robust with respect to model misspecification and additionally can
efficiently adapt to the information accrued in an ongoing study. We focus on
adaptive designs for estimating the minimum effective dose, although
alternative optimality criteria or mixtures thereof could be used, enabling the
design to address multiple objectives.

conducted using ~55,000 snapshot images of the FIRST survey. We present an
analysis leading to the discovery of 1,627 variable and transient objects down
to mJy levels over a wide range of timescales (few minutes to years).
Variations observed range from 20% to a factor of 25. Multi-wavelength matching
for counterparts reveals the diverse classes of objects exhibiting variability,
ranging from nearby stars and pulsars to galaxies and distant quasars.
Interestingly, more than half of the objects in the sample have either no
classified counterparts or no corresponding sources at any other wavelength and
require multi-wavelength follow-up observations. We discuss these classes of
variables and speculate on the identity of objects that lack multi-wavelength
counterparts.

observed in the 340 GHz ($880 \micron$) band at $\sim 5$ arcsec (250 pc)
resolution with the Submillimetre Array (SMA). A source associated with the
central star-forming complex was detected with a flux of $13.6\pm 2.0$ mJy. The
structure is more extended than the beam in the east-west direction. The SMA
880 $\micron$ flux is analyzed by using theoretical models of radio spectral
energy distribution along with centimetre interferometric measurements in the
literature. We find (i) that the SMA 880 $\micron$ flux is dominated ($\sim 75$
per cent) by free-free emission from the central compact star-forming region,
and (ii) that the contribution from dust emission to the SMA 880 $\micron$ flux
is at most $4\pm 2.5$ mJy. We also utilize our models to derive the radio--FIR
relation of the II Zw 40 centre, suggesting that free-free absorption at low

of dust affect the radio-FIR relation.

performance, finding appropriate thresholds according to the operating
condition, and deriving useful aggregated measures such as the area under the
ROC curve (AUC) or the area under the optimal cost curve. In this note we
present some new findings and connections between ROC space and cost space, by
using the expected loss over a range of operating conditions. In particular, we
show that ROC curves can be transferred to cost space by means of a very
natural way of understanding how thresholds should be chosen, by selecting the
threshold such that the proportion of positive predictions equals the operating
condition (either in the form of cost proportion or skew). We call these new
curves {ROC Cost Curves}, and we demonstrate that the expected loss as measured
by the area under these curves is linearly related to AUC. This opens up a
series of new possibilities and clarifies the notion of cost curve and its
relation to ROC analysis. In addition, we show that for a classifier that
assigns the scores in an evenly-spaced way, these curves are equal to the Brier
Curves. As a result, this establishes the first clear connection between AUC

mixture of binary fluids. A nonlocal variant consists of the Navier-Stokes
equations suitably coupled with a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation. The authors,
jointly with P. Colli, have already proven the existence of a global weak
solution to a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system subject to no-slip

dimension two. However, in this case, the energy identity holds. This property
is exploited here to define, following J.M. Ball's approach, a generalized
semiflow which has a global attractor. Through a similar argument, we can also
show the existence of a (connected) global attractor for the convective
nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with a given velocity field, even in dimension
three. Finally, we demonstrate that any weak solution fulfilling the energy
inequality also satisfies an energy inequality. This allows us to establish the
existence of the trajectory attractor also in dimension three with a time

proceeds with no abrupt changes. In the orthorhombic spin-density-wave (SDW)
state a bottleneck associated with a partial charge-gap opening is detected,
similar to previous results in different SDW iron-pnictides. The relative
charge gap magnitude decreases with increasing x. In the superconducting (SC)
state an additional relaxational component appears due to a partial (or
complete) destruction of the SC state proceeding on a sub-0.5-picosecond

destruction energy, U_p/k_B=0.3 K/Fe, is determined near the optimal doping.
The subsequent relatively slow recovery of the SC state indicates clean SC
gaps. The T-dependence of the transient reflectivity amplitude in the normal

states. The polarization anisotropy of the transients suggests that the
pseudogap-like behavior might be associated with a broken point symmetry
resulting from nematic electronic fluctuations persisting up to T~200 K at any

driver of different predictions---different analysts---in order to gain the
full benefits of model averaging. In a standard implementation of our method,
several data analysts work independently on portions of a data set, eliciting
separate models which are eventually updated and combined through a specific
weighting method. We call this modeling procedure Bayesian Synthesis. The
methodology helps to alleviate concerns about the sizable gap between the
foundational underpinnings of the Bayesian paradigm and the practice of
Bayesian statistics. In experimental work we show that human modeling has
predictive performance superior to that of many automatic modeling techniques,
including AIC, BIC, Smoothing Splines, CART, Bagged CART, Bayes CART, BMA and
LARS, and only slightly inferior to that of BART. We also show that Bayesian
Synthesis further improves predictive performance. Additionally, we examine the
predictive performance of a simple average across analysts, which we dub Convex
Synthesis, and find that it also produces an improvement.

  We find that the [NeII] emission line is as compact as the hot dust MIR
continuum, while the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is more
extended. The 6.2 and 7.7 micron PAH emission is more compact than that of the
11.3 micron PAH, which is consistent with the formers being enhanced in a more
ionized medium. The presence of an AGN or a powerful nuclear starburst
increases the compactness of the hot dust MIR continuum, but has a negligible
effect on the spatial extent of the PAH emission on kpc-scales. Globally, the
spectra of the extended emission component are homogeneous for all galaxies in
GOALS. This suggests that the physical properties of star formation taking
place at distances farther than 1.5 kpc from the nuclei of (U)LIRGs are very
similar, resembling local star-forming galaxies with L_IR < 10^11 Lsun, as well
as star formation-dominated ULIRGs at z~2. In contrast, the MIR spectra of the
nuclear component of local (U)LIRGs are very diverse. This implies that the
observed variety of their integrated MIR properties arise, on average, only
from the processes that are taking place in their cores.

closed-form likelihood function, which means that they cannot be treated using
the usual techniques of statistical inference. In the case where such models
can be efficiently simulated, Bayesian inference is still possible thanks to
the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm. Although many refinements
have been suggested, ABC inference is still far from routine. ABC is often
excruciatingly slow due to very low acceptance rates. In addition, ABC requires
introducing a vector of ""summary statistics"", the choice of which is relatively
arbitrary, and often require some trial and error, making the whole process
quite laborious for the user.
  We introduce in this work the EP-ABC algorithm, which is an adaptation to the
likelihood-free context of the variational approximation algorithm known as
Expectation Propagation (Minka, 2001). The main advantage of EP-ABC is that it
is faster by a few orders of magnitude than standard algorithms, while
producing an overall approximation error which is typically negligible. A
second advantage of EP-ABC is that it replaces the usual global ABC constraint
on the vector of summary statistics computed on the whole dataset, by n local
constraints of the form that apply separately to each data-point. As a
consequence, it is often possible to do away with summary statistics entirely.
In that case, EP-ABC approximates directly the evidence (marginal likelihood)
of the model.
  Comparisons are performed in three real-world applications which are typical
of likelihood-free inference, including one application in neuroscience which
is novel, and possibly too challenging for standard ABC techniques.

are targeted by both Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) and Space Laser Interferometry
(SLI). The possibility of a single SMBHB being tracked first by PTA, through
inspiral, and later by SLI, up to merger and ring down, has been previously
suggested. Although the bounding parameters are drawn by the current PTA or the
upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and by the New Gravitational Observatory
(NGO), derived from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), this paper
also addresses sequential detection beyond specific project constraints. We
consider PTA-SKA, which is sensitive from 10^(-9) to p x 10^(-7) Hz (p=4, 8),
and SLI, which operates from s x 10^(-5) up to 1 Hz (s = 1, 3). A SMBHB in the
range 2x 10^(8) - 2 x 10^(9) solar masses (the masses are normalised to a (1+z)
factor, the red shift lying between z = 0.2 and z=1.5) moves from the PTA-SKA
to the SLI band over a period ranging from two months to fifty years. By
combining three Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH)-host relations with three
accretion prescriptions, nine astrophysical scenarios are formed. They are then
related to three levels of pulsar timing residuals (50, 5, 1 ns), generating
twenty-seven cases. For residuals of 1 ns, sequential detection probability
will never be better than 4.7 x 10^(-4) y^(-2) or 3.3 x 10^(-6) y^(-2) (per
year to merger and per year of survey), according to the best and worst
astrophysical scenarios, respectively; put differently this means one
sequential detection every 46 or 550 years for an equivalent maximum time to
merger and duration of the survey. The chances of sequential detection are
further reduced by increasing values of the s parameter (they vanish for s =
10) and of the SLI noise, and by decreasing values of the remnant spin. REST OF

one-dimensional elastic interfaces in a random potential is studied. We analyze
the ground state configuration at zero driving force, and the critical
configuration exactly at the depinning threshold, both for the random-manifold
and random-periodic universality classes. These configurations are sampled by
exact numerical methods, and their MRH distributions are compared with those
with the same roughness exponent and boundary conditions, but produced by
independent Fourier modes with normally distributed amplitudes. Using Pickands'
theorem we derive an exact analytical description for the right tail of the
latter. After properly rescaling the MRH distributions we find that corrections
from the Gaussian independent modes approximation are in general small, as
previously found for the average width distribution of depinning
configurations. In the large size limit all corrections are finite except for
the ground-state in the random-periodic class whose MRH distribution becomes,
for periodic boundary conditions, indistinguishable from the Airy distribution.
We find that the MRH distributions are, in general, sensitive to changes of
boundary conditions.

dilemma in quantum mechanics in 'the light of experimental tests of the Bell
inequality for two entangled photons and a Bell-like inequality for a single
neutron. My conclusion is that these experiments show that quantum mechanics is
nonobjective: that is, the values of physical observables cannot be assigned to
a system before measurement. Bell's assumption of nonlocality has to be
rejected as having no direct experimental confirmation, at least thus far. I
also consider the relationships between nonobjectivity and contextuality.
Specifically, I analyze the impact of the Kochen-Specker theorem on the problem
of contextuality of quantum observables. I argue that, just as von Neumann's
""no-go"" theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem is based on assumptions that do not
correspond to the real physical situation. Finally, I present a theory of
measurement based on a classical, purely wave model (pre-quantum classical
statistical field theory), a model that reproduces quantum probabilities. In
this model continuous fields are transformed into discrete clicks of detectors.
While this model is classical, it is nonobjective. In this case, nonobjectivity
is the result of the dependence of experimental outcomes on the context of
measurement, in accordance with Bohr's view.
