  system",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is dedicated to the study of both viscous compressible barotropic
fluids and Navier-Stokes equation with dependent density, when the viscosity
coefficients are variable, in dimension $d\geq2$. We aim at proving the local
and global well-posedness for respectively {\it large} and \textit{small}
initial data having critical Besov regularity and more precisely we are
interested in extending the class of initial data velocity when we consider the
shallow water system, improving the results in \cite{CMZ1,H2} and \cite{arma}.
Our result relies on the fact that the velocity $u$ can be written as the sum
of the solution $u_{L}$ of the associated linear system and a remainder
velocity term $\bar{u}$; then in the specific case of the shallow-water system
the remainder term $\bar{u}$ is more regular than $u_{L}$ by taking into
account the regularizing effects induced on the bilinear convection term. In
particular we are able to deal with initial velocity in $\dot{H}^{\N-1}$ as
Fujita and Kato for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (see \cite{FK})
with an additional condition of type $u_{0}\in B^{-1}_{\infty,1}$. We would
like to point out that this type of result is of particular interest when we
want to deal with the problem of the convergence of the solution of
compressible system to the incompressible system when the Mach number goes to
0.

Maxwell--Born equations admit at most a unique stationary finite-energy

of electromagnetism, the following physical consequences emerge: source-free
field solitons moving at speeds less than the vacuum speed of light $c$ do not

not yield matching upper and lower bounds. Sophisticated but non-rigorous
arguments from statistical mechanics have ascribed this discrepancy to the
existence of a phase transition called condensation that occurs shortly before
the actual threshold for the existence of solutions and that affects the
combinatorial nature of the problem (Krzakala, Montanari, Ricci-Tersenghi,
Semerjian, Zdeborova: PNAS 2007). In this paper we prove for the first time
that a condensation transition exists in a natural random CSP, namely in random
hypergraph 2-coloring. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the second moment
method breaks down strictly \emph{before} the condensation transition. Our
proof also yields slightly improved bounds on the threshold for random

  prior information with an application to hypothesis testing",,,,,"stat.ME cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The following zero-sum game between nature and a statistician blends Bayesian
methods with frequentist methods such as p-values and confidence intervals.
Nature chooses a posterior distribution consistent with a set of possible
priors. At the same time, the statistician selects a parameter distribution for
inference with the goal of maximizing the minimum Kullback-Leibler information
gained over a confidence distribution or other benchmark distribution. An
application to testing a simple null hypothesis leads the statistician to
report a posterior probability of the hypothesis that is informed by both
Bayesian and frequentist methodology, each weighted according how well the
prior is known.
  Since neither the Bayesian approach nor the frequentist approach is entirely
satisfactory in situations involving partial knowledge of the prior
distribution, the proposed procedure reduces to a Bayesian method given
complete knowledge of the prior, to a frequentist method given complete
ignorance about the prior, and to a blend between the two methods given partial
knowledge of the prior. The blended approach resembles the Bayesian method
rather than the frequentist method to the precise extent that the prior is
known.
  The problem of testing a point null hypothesis illustrates the proposed
framework. The blended probability that the null hypothesis is true is equal to
the p-value or a lower bound of an unknown Bayesian posterior probability,
whichever is greater. Thus, given total ignorance represented by a lower bound
of 0, the p-value is used instead of any Bayesian posterior probability. At the
opposite extreme of a known prior, the p-value is ignored. In the intermediate
case, the possible Bayesian posterior probability that is closest to the
p-value is used for inference. Thus, both the Bayesian method and the
frequentist method influence the inferences made.

analysis of structurally modulated crystals, it has remained during the last
thirty years almost unexplored as a practical tool to deal with magnetic
incommensurate structures. This situation has recently changed with the
development of new computer tools for magnetic phases based on this formalism.
In this context we show here that, as in the case of nonmagnetic incommensurate
systems, the concept of superspace symmetry provides a simple, efficient and
systematic way to characterize the symmetry and rationalize the structural and
physical properties of incommensurate magnetic materials. The method introduces
significant advantages over the most commonly employed method of representation
analysis for the description of the magnetic structure of a crystal. But, more
importantly, in contrast with that method, it consistently yields and
classifies all degrees of freedom of the system. The knowledge of the
superspace group of an incommensurate magnetic material allows to predict its
crystal tensor properties and to rationalize its phase diagram, previous to any
appeal to microscopic models or mechanisms. This is especially relevant when
the properties of incommensurate multiferroics are being studied. We present
first a summary of the superspace method under a very practical viewpoint
particularized to magnetic modulations. Its relation with the usual
representation analysis is then analyzed in detail, with the derivation of
important general rules for magnetic modulations with a single propagation
vector. The power and efficiency of the formalism is illustrated with various
selected examples, including some multiferroic materials.

interferometer (AI) designs useful for assessing the performance of such

function in a given AI design using two separate elements. These are (1)
modeling the effect of a Bragg pulse on the wave function and (2) approximating
the evolution of the wave function during the intervals between the pulses. The
actual sequence of these pulses and intervals is then followed to determine the
approximate final wave function from which the interference pattern can be
calculated. The exact evolution between pulses is assumed to be governed by the
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation whose solution is approximated using a
Lagrangian Variational Method to facilitate rapid prototyping. The method
presented here is an extension of an earlier one that was used to analyze the
results of an experiment [J.E. Simsarian, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 2040

Mach- Zehnder-type Bragg AI. We have developed both 1D and 3D versions of this

interference patterns with those obtained by numerical integration of the 1D GP
equation and with the results of the above experiment. We find excellent
agreement between the 1D interference patterns predicted by this method and
those found by the GP equation. We show that we can reproduce all of the
results of that experiment without recourse to an ad hoc velocity-kick
correction needed by the earlier method, including some experimental results

estimates of 1D interference patterns at least four orders-of-magnitude faster

towards the observer's line-of-sight and shows downflows (redshifts) of around
15 km/s up to a temperature of 0.8 MK, but for temperatures of 1.0 MK and above
the measured velocity shifts are consistent with no net flow. This velocity
result applies over a projected spatial distance of 9 Mm and demonstrates that
the cooler, redshifted plasma is physically disconnected from the hotter,
stationary plasma. A scenario in which the fan loops consist of at least two
groups of ""strands"" - one cooler and downflowing, the other hotter and
stationary -- is suggested. The cooler strands may represent a later
evolutionary stage of the hotter strands. A density diagnostic of Mg VII was
used to show that the electron density at around 0.8 MK falls from 3.2 x 10^9
cm^-3 at the loop base, to 5.0 x 10^8 cm^-3 at a projected height of 15 Mm. A
filling factor of 0.2 is found at temperatures close to the formation
temperature of Mg VII (0.8 MK), confirming that the cooler, downflowing plasma
occupies only a fraction of the apparent loop volume. The fan loop is rooted
within a so-called ""outflow region"" that displays low intensity and blueshifts
of up to 25 km/s in Fe XII 195.12 A (formed at 1.5 MK), in contrast to the

mass and collider based probes of missing transverse energy H_T^miss may
facilitate a two tiered approach to the initial discovery of supersymmetry and
the subsequent reconstruction of the LSP mass at the LHC. These correlations
are demonstrated via extensive Monte Carlo simulation of seventeen benchmark
models, each sampled at five distinct LHC center-of-mass beam energies,
spanning the parameter space of No-Scale F-SU(5).This construction is defined
in turn by the union of the Flipped SU(5) Grand Unified Theory, two pairs of
hypothetical TeV scale vector-like supersymmetric multiplets with origins in
F-theory, and the dynamically established boundary conditions of No-Scale
Supergravity. In addition, we consider a control sample comprised of a standard
minimal Supergravity benchmark point. Led by a striking similarity between the
H_T^miss distribution and the familiar power spectrum of a black body radiator
at various temperatures, we implement a broad empirical fit of our simulation
against a Poisson distribution ansatz. We advance the resulting fit as a
theoretical blueprint for deducing the mass of the LSP, utilizing only the
missing transverse energy in a statistical sampling of >= 9 jet events.
Cumulative uncertainties central to the method subsist at a satisfactory 12-15%
level. The fact that supersymmetric particle spectrum of No-Scale F-SU(5) has
thrived the withering onslaught of early LHC data that is steadily decimating
the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and minimal Supergravity
parameter spaces is a prime motivation for augmenting more conventional LSP
search methodologies with the presently proposed alternative.

electrostatically modulate the current by several orders of magnitude. The gap
arises by angularly sorting electrons by their longitudinal energy and
filtering out the hottest, normally incident electrons with the tunnel barrier,
and the rest through total internal reflection. Using analytical and atomistic
numerical studies of quantum transport, we show that the complete filtering of
all incident electrons causes the GPNJ to act as a novel metamaterial with a
unique gate-tunable transmission-gap that generates a sharp non-thermal
switching of electrons. In fact, the transmission gap gradually diminishes to
zero as we electrostatically reduce the voltage gradient across the junction
towards the homogeneous doping limit. The resulting gate tunable
metal-insulator transition enables the electrons to overcome the classic room

conduction.

investigate and compare different methods for detecting and quantifying mass
segregation and substructure in non-seeing limited N-body data. For this
purpose we generate star cluster models with different degrees of mass
segregation and fractal substructure and analyse them. We quantify mass
segregation by measuring, from the projected 2d model data, the mass function
slope in radial annuli, by looking for colour gradients in radial colour
profiles, by measuring Allison's Lambda parameter, and by determining the local
stellar surface density around each star. We find that these methods for
quantifying mass segregation often produce ambiguous results. Most reliable for
detecting mass segregation is the mass function slope method, whereas the
colour gradient method is the least practical in an R136-like configuration.
The other two methods are more sensitive to low degrees of mass segregation but
are computationally much more demanding. We also discuss the effect of binaries
on these measures. Moreover, we quantify substructure by looking at the
projected radial stellar density profile, by comparing projected azimuthal
stellar density profiles, and by determining Cartwright & Whitworth's Q
parameter. We find that only high degrees of substructure affect the projected
radial density profile, whereas the projected azimuthal density profile is very
sensitive to substructure. The Q parameter is also sensitive to substructure
but its absolute value shows a dependence on the radial density gradient of the
cluster and is strongly influenced by binaries. (abridged)

have carefully selected two SDSS quasars at z~4. These quasars are
representative of the most luminous quasars known at this epoch but they also,
crucially, lie within 40 arcsec of comparably-bright foreground stars (required
for accurate PSF definition), and have redshifts which ensure line-free Ks-band
imaging. The data were obtained in excellent seeing (<0.4-arcsec) at the ESO
VLT with integration times of ~5.5 hours per source. Via carefully-controlled
separation of host-galaxy and nuclear light, we estimate the luminosities and
stellar masses of the host galaxies, and set constraints on their half-light
radii. The quasar host galaxies have K-band luminosities similar to radio
galaxies at comparable redshifts, suggesting that these quasar hosts are also
among the most massive galaxies in existence at this epoch. However, the quasar
hosts are a factor ~5 smaller than the host galaxies of luminous low-redshift
quasars. We estimate the stellar masses of the z~4 host galaxies to lie in the
range 2-10x10^11 Msol, and use the CIV emission line in the Sloan spectra to
estimate the masses of their black holes. The results imply a
black-hole:host-galaxy mass ratio Mbh:Mgal~0.01-0.05. This is an order of
magnitude higher than typically seen in the low-redshift Universe, and is
consistent with existing evidence for a systematic growth in this mass ratio

quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) from the lowest, i.e. radio, to the highest,
i.e. gamma-ray, part of the electromagnetic spectrum. To this day, it is still
unclear which mechanism creates such QPPs. In this paper, we analyze four
bright solar flares which show compelling signatures of quasi-periodic behavior
and were observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (\gbm) onboard the Fermi
satellite. Because GBM covers over 3 decades in energy (8 keV to 40 MeV) it can
be a key instrument to understand the physical processes which drive solar
flares. We tested for periodicity in the time series of the solar flares
observed by GBM by applying a classical periodogram analysis. However, contrary
to previous authors, we did not detrend the raw light curve before creating the
power spectral density spectrum (PSD). To assess the significance of the
frequencies we made use of a method which is commonly applied for X-ray
binaries and Seyfert galaxies. This technique takes into account the underlying
continuum of the PSD which for all of these sources has a P(f) ~ f^{-\alpha}
dependence and is typically labeled red-noise. We checked the reliability of
this technique by applying it to a solar flare which was observed by the Reuven
Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) which contains, besides
any potential periodicity from the Sun, a 4 s rotational period due to the
rotation of the spacecraft around its axis. While we do not find an intrinsic
solar quasi-periodic pulsation we do reproduce the instrumental periodicity.
Moreover, with the method adopted here, we do not detect significant QPPs in
the four bright solar flares observed by GBM. We stress that for the purpose of
such kind of analyses it is of uttermost importance to appropriately account
for the red-noise component in the PSD of these astrophysical sources.

shells found in their neutral hydrogen (HI) distributions. We use high
resolution hydrodynamic simulations to show that pure DM sub-halos impacting a
galactic disk are not able to produce holes; on the contrary, they result in
high density regions in the disk. However, sub-halos containing a small amount
of gas (a few percent of the total DM mass of the sub-halo) are able to
displace the gas in the disk and form holes and shells. The size and lifetime
of these holes depend on the sub-halo gas mass, density and impact velocity. A
DM sub-halo of mass $10^8$ $M_{\odot}$ and a gas mass fraction of $\sim 3$%, is
able to create a kpc scale hole, with a lifetime similar to those observed in
nearby galaxies. We also register an increase in the star formation rate at the
rim of the hole, again in agreement with observations. Even though the
properties off these simulated structures resemble those found in observations
we find that the number of predicted holes (based on mass and orbital
distributions of DM halos derived from cosmological N-body simulations) falls
short compared to the observations. Only a handful of holes are produced per
Giga year. This leads us to conclude that DM halo impact is not the major
channel through which these holes are formed.

frequency coverage of EVLA radio observations, along with observations at other

temporal characteristics of nova explosions. Our observations of V1723 Aql span
1-37 GHz in frequency, and we report on data from 14-175 days following the
time of the nova explosion. The broad frequency coverage and frequent
monitoring show that the radio behavior of V1723 Aql does not follow the
classic Hubble-flow model of homologous spherically expanding thermal ejecta.
The spectra are always at least partially optically thin, and the flux rises on
faster timescales than can be reproduced with linear expansion. Therefore, any
description of the underlying physical processes must go beyond this simple
picture. The unusual spectral properties and light curve evolution might be
explained by multiple emitting regions or shocked material. Indeed, X-ray
observations from Swift reveal that shocks are likely present.

derivative gravity involving an infinite number of derivative terms. We know
that the usual quadratic action is renormalizable but suffers of the unitarity
problem because of the presence of a ghost (state of negative norm) in the
theory. The new theory is instead ghost-free since the introduction of (in
general) two entire functions in the model with the property do not introduce
new poles in the propagator. The local high derivative theory is recovered
expanding the entire functions to the lowest order in the mass scale of the
theory. Any truncation of the entire functions gives rise to the unitarity
violation but if we keep all the infinite series we do not fall into these
troubles. The theory is renormalizable at one loop and finite from two loops
on. Since only a finite number of graphs are divergent then the theory is
super-renormalizable. We analyze the fractal properties of the theory at high
energy showing a reduction of the spacetime dimension at short scales. Black
hole spherical symmetric solutions are also studied omitting the high curvature
corrections in the equation of motions. The solutions are regular and the

nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We use a two-stretch template-fitting
method to measure the rise and decline of BV light curves. Our analysis of 61
SNe with high-quality light curves indicates that the longer the time between
explosion and maximum light (i.e., the rise time), the slower the decline of
the light curve after maximum. However, SNe with slower post-maximum decline
rates have a faster rise than would be expected from a single-parameter family
of light curves, indicating that SN Ia light curves are not a single-parameter
family of varying widths. Comparison of the B-band rise-time distribution for
spectroscopically normal SNe Ia to those exhibiting high-velocity spectral
features indicates that high-velocity (HV) SNe Ia have shorter B-band rise
times compared to their spectroscopically normal counterparts. After
normalising the B-band light curves to Dm15(B)= 1.1 mag (i.e., correcting the
post-maximum decline to have the same shape as our template), we find that
spectroscopically normal SNe Ia have a rise time of 18.03 +/- 0.24 d, while HV
SNe have a faster B-band rise time of 16.63 +/- 0.29 d. Despite differences in
the B band, we find that HV and normal SNe Ia have similar rise times in the V
band. The initial rise of a SN Ia B-band light curve follows a power law with
index 2.20 +0.27 -0.19, consistent with a parabolic rise in flux predicted by
an expanding fireball toy model. We compare our early-time B-band data to
models for the predicted signature of companion interaction arising from the
single-degenerate progenitor scenario. There is a substantial degree of
degeneracy between the adopted power-law index of the SN light-curve template,
the rise time, and the amount of shock emission required to match the data.

of independent random samples. An extreme-value copula is determined by its
Pickands dependence function, which is a function on the unit simplex subject
to certain shape constraints that arise from an integral transform of an
underlying measure called spectral measure. Multivariate extensions are
provided of certain rank-based nonparametric estimators of the Pickands
dependence function. The shape constraint that the estimator should itself be a
Pickands dependence function is enforced by replacing an initial estimator by
its best least-squares approximation in the set of Pickands dependence
functions having a discrete spectral measure supported on a sufficiently fine

finite-sample performance of the estimators is investigated by means of a

configurations has proven to be very useful in many astrophysical contexts,
from planetary to triple-star systems. In this approximation the orbits may
change shape and orientation, on time scales longer than the orbital time
scales, but the semi major axes are constant. For example, for highly inclined
triple systems, the Kozai-Lidov mechanism can produce large-amplitude
oscillations of the eccentricities and inclinations. Here we revisit the
secular dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. We derive the secular
evolution equations to octupole order in Hamiltonian perturbation theory. Our
derivation corrects an error in some previous treatments of the problem that
implicitly assumed a conservation of the z-component of the angular momentum of
the inner orbit (i.e., parallel to the total angular momentum of the system).
Already to quadrupole order, our results show new behaviors including the
possibility for a system to oscillate from prograde to retrograde orbits. At
the octupole order, for an eccentric outer orbit, the inner orbit can reach
extremely high eccentricities and undergo chaotic flips in its orientation. We
discuss applications to a variety of astrophysical systems, from stellar
triples to merging compact binaries and planetary systems. Our results agree
with those of previous studies done to quadrupole order only in the limit in
which one of the inner two bodies is a massless test particle and the outer
orbit is circular;our results agree with previous studies at octupole order for
the eccentricity evolution, but not for the inclination evolution.

of the flame, and so the idea of laminar burning propagated by conduction is no
longer valid. The nature of the burning depends on the turbulent Damkohler
number (Da), which steadily declines from much greater than one to less that
one as the density decreases to a few 10^6 g/cc. Scaling arguments predict that
the turbulent flame speed s, normalized by the turbulent intensity u, follows
s/u=Da^1/2 for Da<1. The flame in this regime is a single turbulently-broadened
structure that moves at a steady speed, and has a width larger than the
integral scale of the turbulence. The scaling is predicted to break down at
Da=1, and the flame burns as a turbulently-broadened effective unity Lewis
number flame. We refer to this kind of flame as a lambda-flame. The burning
becomes a collection of lambda-flames spread over a region approximately the
size of the integral scale. While the total burning rate continues to have a
well-defined average, s_{T} ~ u, the burning is unsteady. We present a
theoretical framework, supported by both 1D and 3D numerical simulations, for
the burning in these two regimes. Our results indicate that the average value
of s can actually be roughly twice u for Da>1, and that localized excursions to
as much as five times u can occur. The lambda-flame speed and width can be
predicted based on the turbulence in the star and the turbulent nuclear burning
time scale of the fuel. We propose a practical method for measuring these based
on the scaling relations and small-scale computationally-inexpensive
simulations. This suggests that a simple turbulent flame model can be easily
constructed suitable for large-scale distributed supernovae flames.

aims of the paper are to examine the response of the inductive oxygen flame to
intense levels of turbulence, and to explore the possibility of transition to
detonation in the oxygen flame. Scaling arguments analogous to the carbon
flames are presented and then compared against three-dimensional simulations
for a range of Damk\""ohler numbers ($\Da_{16}$) at a fixed Karlovitz number.
The simulations suggest that turbulence does not significantly affect the
oxygen flame when $\Da_{16}<1$, and the flame burns inductively some distance
behind the carbon flame. However, for $\Da_{16}>1$, turbulence enhances heat
transfer and drives the propagation of a flame that is {\em narrower} than the
corresponding inductive flame would be. Furthermore, burning under these
conditions appears to occur as part of a combined carbon-oxygen turbulent flame
with complex compound structure. The simulations do not appear to support the
possibility of a transition to detonation in the oxygen flame, but do not
preclude it either.

for example, the high-density regions at the cores of dense clusters are known
to suppress star formation. It has been suggested that galaxy transformation
occurs largely in groups, which are the intermediate step in density between
field and cluster environments. In this paper, we use deep MIPS 24 micron
observations of intermediate-redshift (0.3 < z < 0.55) group and field galaxies
from the Group Environment and Evolution Collaboration (GEEC) subset of the
Second Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC2) survey to probe the
moderate-density environment of groups, wherein the majority of galaxies are
found. The completeness limit of our study is log(L_TIR (L_sun)) > 10.5,
corresponding to SFR > 2.7 M_sun/yr. We find that the group and field galaxies
have different distributions of morphologies and mass. However, individual
group galaxies have star-forming properties comparable to those of field
galaxies of similar mass and morphology; that is, the group environment does
not appear to modify the properties of these galaxies directly. There is a
relatively large number of massive early-type group spirals, along with E/S0
galaxies, that are forming stars above our detection limit. These galaxies
account for the nearly comparable level of star-forming activity in groups as
compared with the field, despite the differences in mass and morphology
distributions between the two environments. The distribution of specific SFRs
(SFR/M_*) is shifted to lower values in the groups, reflecting the fact that
groups contain a higher proportion of massive and less active galaxies.
Considering the distributions of morphology, mass, and SFR, the group members
appear to lie between field and cluster galaxies in overall properties.

we analyze the stability of antisolar and solar type latitudinal differential
rotations in the tachoclines of typical F,G and K stars. We employ two
three-dimensional thin shell models, one for a Boussinesq but non-hydrostatic
system, the other for a hydrostatic but non-Boussinesq system. We find that, in
general, the combination of toroidal field band and differential rotation is
more unstable, and unstable for lower toroidal fields, for antisolar than for
solar-type differential rotation. In the antisolar case, the instability is
always found to weaken the differential rotation, even if the primary energy
source for the instability is the magnetic field. This favors surface antisolar
differential rotations in stars being weaker than solar types, if the
instability in the tachocline is felt at the surface of the star. This is most
likely to happen in F stars, whose convection zones are much thinner than they
are in G and K stars. This effect could help explain why the antisolar
differential rotations that have been found are very weak compared to the Sun.

sources of HXR emission with spectra matching thermal electron populations

of electron thermalization within the small source region, both provide
evidence of high densities at the looptop; typically more than an order of
magnitude above ambient. Where some investigators have suggested such density
enhancement results from a rapid enhancement in the magnetic field strength, we
propose an alternative model, based on Petschek reconnection, whereby looptop
plasma is heated and compressed by slow magnetosonic shocks generated
self-consistently through flux retraction following reconnection. Under steady
conditions such shocks can enhance density by no more than a factor of four.
These steady shock relations (Rankine-Hugoniot relations) turn out to be
inapplicable to Petschek's model owing to transient effects of thermal
conduction. The actual density enhancement can in fact exceed a factor of ten
over the entire reconnection outflow. An ensemble of flux tubes retracting
following reconnection at an ensemble of distinct sites will have a collective
emission measure proportional to the rate of flux tube production. This rate,
distinct from the local reconnection rate within a single tube, can be measured
separately through flare ribbon motion. Typical flux transfer rates and loop
parameters yield emission measures comparable to those observed in super-hot
sources.

This extension of quantum mechanics rests on the Galilean line group, the

transformations between all inertial and non-inertial reference frames and
contains the Galilei group as a subgroup. We construct a certain class of
unitary representations of the Galilean line group and show that these
representations determine the structure of quantum mechanics in non-inertial
reference frames. Our representations of the Galilean line group contain the
usual unitary projective representations of the Galilei group, but have a more
intricate cocycle structure. The transformation formula for the Hamiltonian
under the Galilean line group shows that in a non-inertial reference frame it
acquires a fictitious potential energy term that is proportional to the
inertial mass, suggesting the equivalence of inertial mass and gravitational

  Our focus is on computationally efficient data release algorithms; we seek
algorithms whose running time is polynomial, or at least sub-exponential, in
the data dimensionality. Our primary contribution is a computationally
efficient reduction from differentially private data release for a class of
counting queries, to learning thresholded sums of predicates from a related
class.
  We instantiate this general reduction with a variety of algorithms for
learning thresholds. These instantiations yield several new results for
differentially private data release. As two examples, taking {0,1}^d to be the
data domain (of dimension d), we obtain differentially private algorithms for:
  (*) Releasing all k-way conjunctions. For any given k, the resulting data
release algorithm has bounded error as long as the database is of size at least
d^{O(\sqrt{k\log(k\log d)})}. The running time is polynomial in the database
size.
  (*) Releasing a (1-\gamma)-fraction of all parity queries. For any \gamma
\geq \poly(1/d), the algorithm has bounded error as long as the database is of
size at least \poly(d). The running time is polynomial in the database size.
  Several other instantiations yield further results for privacy-preserving
data release. Of the two results highlighted above, the first learning
algorithm uses techniques for representing thresholded sums of predicates as
low-degree polynomial threshold functions. The second learning algorithm is
based on Jackson's Harmonic Sieve algorithm [Jackson 1997].

diffeomorphism transformations, the ADM transformations (as well as others,

multi-phase field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. By investigating an
incompressible fluid with a two-phase field geometrically, we reformulate the
expression of the surface tension for the two-phase field found by Lafaurie,
Nardone, Scardovelli, Zaleski and Zanetti (J. Comp. Phys. \vol{113} \yr{1994}
\pages{134-147}) as a variational problem related to an infinite dimensional
Lie group, the volume-preserving diffeomorphism. The variational principle to
the action integral with the surface energy reproduces their Euler equation of
the two-phase field with the surface tension. Since the surface energy of
multiple interfaces even with singularities is not difficult to be evaluated in
general and the variational formulation works for every action integral, the
new formulation enables us to extend their expression to that of a multi-phase
($N$-phase, $N\ge2$) flow and to obtain a novel Euler equation with the surface
tension of the multi-phase field. The obtained Euler equation governs the
equation of motion of the multi-phase field with different surface tension
coefficients without any difficulties for the singularities at multiple
junctions. In other words, we unify the theory of multi-phase fields which
express low dimensional interface geometry and the theory of the incompressible
fluid dynamics on the infinite dimensional geometry as a variational problem.
We apply the equation to the contact angle problems at triple junctions. We
computed the fluid dynamics for a two-phase field with a wall numerically and
show the numerical computational results that for given surface tension
coefficients, the contact angles are generated by the surface tension as
results of balances of the kinematic energy and the surface energy.

information on the AT20G sources in the form of optical counterparts and
redshifts. Optical counterparts were identified using the SuperCOSMOS database
and redshifts were found from either the 6dF Galaxy survey or the literature.
We also report 144 new redshifts. For AT20G sources outside the Galactic plane,
78.5% have optical identifications and 30.9% have redshift information. The
optical identification rate also increases with increasing flux density.
Targets which had optical spectra available were examined to obtain a spectral
classification.
  There appear to be two distinct AT20G populations; the high luminosity
quasars that are generally associated with point-source optical counterparts
and exhibit strong emission lines in the optical spectrum, and the lower
luminosity radio galaxies that are generally associated with passive galaxies
in both the optical images and spectroscopic properties. It is suggested that
these different populations can be associated with different accretion modes
(cold-mode or hot-mode). We find that the cold-mode sources have a steeper
spectral index and produce more luminous radio lobes, but generally reside in
smaller host galaxies than their hot-mode counterparts. This can be attributed
to the fact that they are accreting material more efficiently. Lastly, we
compare the AT20G survey with the S-cubed semi-empirical (S3-SEX) models and
conclude that the S3-SEX models need refining to correctly model the compact
cores of AGN. The AT20G survey provides the ideal sample to do this.

the first geometric discretization of the Ric. This result is fundamental for
higher-dimensional generalizations of discrete RF. We construct this tensor on
both the simplicial lattice and its dual and prove their equivalence. We show
that the Ric is an edge-based weighted average of deficit divided by an
edge-based weighted average of dual area -- an expression similar to the
vertex-based weighted average of the scalar curvature reported recently. We use
this Ric in a third and independent geometric derivation of the RC Einstein

epidemic model describes how infections spread throughout a network. Among the
compartmental models used to describe epidemics, the
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model has been widely used. In the SIS
model, each node can be susceptible, become infected with a given infection
rate, and become again susceptible with a given curing rate. In this paper, we
add a new compartment to the classic SIS model to account for human response to
epidemic spread. Each individual can be infected, susceptible, or alert.
Susceptible individuals can become alert with an alerting rate if infected
individuals exist in their neighborhood. An individual in the alert state is
less probable to become infected than an individual in the susceptible state;
due to a newly adopted cautious behavior. The problem is formulated as a
continuous-time Markov process on a general static graph and then modeled into
a set of ordinary differential equations using mean field approximation method
and the corresponding Kolmogorov forward equations. The model is then studied
using results from algebraic graph theory and center manifold theorem. We
analytically show that our model exhibits two distinct thresholds in the
dynamics of epidemic spread. Below the first threshold, infection dies out
exponentially. Beyond the second threshold, infection persists in the steady
state. Between the two thresholds, the infection spreads at the first stage but
then dies out asymptotically as the result of increased alertness in the
network. Finally, simulations are provided to support our findings. Our results
suggest that alertness can be considered as a strategy of controlling the
epidemics which propose multiple potential areas of applications, from
infectious diseases mitigations to malware impact reduction.

Bregman distance for Tikhonov like convex regularisation for linear operator
equations on Banach spaces. The approach is based on the idea of variational
inequalities, which are, however, not imposed on the original Tikhonov
functional, but rather on a dual functional. Because of that, the approach is
not limited to convergence rates of lower order, but yields the same range of
rates that is well known for quadratic regularisation on Hilbert spaces.

time (the algorithm of Karp and Hopcroft \cite{HK73} also achieves this bound).
For regular bipartite graphs one can achieve an $O(m)$ time algorithm which,
following a series of papers, has been recently improved to $O(n \log n)$ by
Goel, Kapralov and Khanna (STOC 2010) \cite{GKK10}. In this paper we present a
randomized algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo paradigm which runs
in $O(m \log^2 n)$ time, thereby obtaining a significant improvement over
\cite{MV80}.
  We use a Markov chain similar to the \emph{hard-core model} for Glauber
Dynamics with \emph{fugacity} parameter $\lambda$, which is used to sample
independent sets in a graph from the Gibbs Distribution \cite{V99}, to design a
faster algorithm for finding maximum matchings in general graphs. Our result
crucially relies on the fact that the mixing time of our Markov Chain is
independent of $\lambda$, a significant deviation from the recent series of
works \cite{GGSVY11,MWW09, RSVVY10, S10, W06} which achieve computational
transition (for estimating the partition function) on a threshold value of
$\lambda$. As a result we are able to design a randomized algorithm which runs
in $O(m\log^2 n)$ time that provides a major improvement over the running time
of the algorithm due to Micali and Vazirani. Using the conductance bound, we
also prove that mixing takes $\Omega(\frac{m}{k})$ time where $k$ is the size

the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on

to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based
model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees
on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify
richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of
this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes
system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use
a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main
insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under
reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of
the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty,
and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves
performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned
dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same
inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty.
Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC
control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the
true dynamics.

optimal model parameters by going through the data in only one pass. Polyak and
Juditsky (1992) showed that asymptotically the test performance of the simple
average of the parameters obtained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is as
good as that of the parameters which minimize the empirical cost. However, to
our knowledge, despite its optimal asymptotic convergence rate, averaged SGD
(ASGD) received little attention in recent research on large scale learning.
One possible reason is that it may take a prohibitively large number of
training samples for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region for most real
problems. In this paper, we present a finite sample analysis for the method of
Polyak and Juditsky (1992). Our analysis shows that it indeed usually takes a
huge number of samples for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region for improperly
chosen learning rate. More importantly, based on our analysis, we propose a
simple way to properly set learning rate so that it takes a reasonable amount
of data for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region. We compare ASGD using our
proposed learning rate with other well known algorithms for training large
scale linear classifiers. The experiments clearly show the superiority of ASGD.

regularity for modules over an algebra graded by a finitely generated abelian
group.
  Our notion of regularity is based on Maclagan and Smith's definition, and is
extended first by working over any commutative base ring, and second by
considering local cohomology with support in an arbitrary finitely generated
graded ideal $B$, obtaining, for each $B$, a $B$-regularity region. The first
extension provides a natural approach for working with families of sheaves or
of graded modules, while the second opens new applications.
  We provide tools to transfer knowledge in two directions. First to deduce
some information on the graded Betti numbers from the knowledge of regions
where the local cohomology with support in a given graded ideal vanishes. This
is one of our main results. Conversely, vanishing of local cohomology with
support in any graded ideal is deduced from the shifts in a free resolution and
the local cohomology of the polynomial ring. Furthermore, the flexibility of
treating local cohomology with respect to any $B$ open new possibilities for
passing information.
  We provide new persistence results for the vanishing of local cohomology that
extend the fact that weakly regular implies regular in the classical case, and
we give sharp estimates for the regularity of a truncation of a module.
  In the last part, we present a result on Hilbert functions for multigraded
polynomial rings, that in particular provides a simple proof of the
Grothendieck-Serre formula.

Doob-transformation techniques consist of a selection of x_{t}-paths procedure.
The law of the transformed process is the one of a branching diffusion system
of particles, each diffusing like a new process tilde{x}_{t}, superposing an
additional drift to the one of x_{t}. Killing and/or branching of
tilde{x}_{t}-particles occur at some space-dependent rate lambda. For this
transformed process, so in the class of branching diffusions, the question
arises as to whether the particle system is sub-critical, critical or
super-critical. In the first two cases, extinction occurs with probability one.
We apply this circle of ideas to diffusion processes arising in population
genetics. In this setup, the process x_{t} is a Wright-Fisher (WF) diffusion,
either neutral or with mutations. We study a particular Doob transform which is
based on the exponential function in the usual fitness parameter sigma. We have
in mind that this is an alternative way to introduce selection or fitness in
both WF-like diffusions, leading to branching diffusion models ideas. For this
Doob-transform model of fitness, the usual selection drift sigma x(1-x) should
be superposed to the one of x_{t} to form tilde{x}_{t} which is the process
that can branch, binarily. In the first neutral case, there is a trade-off
between branching events giving birth to new particles and absorption at the
boundaries, killing the particles. Under our assumptions, the branching
diffusion process gets eventually globally extinct in finite time with
exponential tails. In the second case with mutations, there is a trade-off
between killing events removing some particles from the system and reflection
at the boundaries where the particles survive. This branching diffusion process
also gets eventually globally extinct but in very long finite time with
power-law tails. Our approach relies on the spectral expansion of the
transition probability kernels of both x_{t} and tilde{x}_{t}.

half of which rotate slowly, only at ten per cent of their breakup velocity.
The disk-locking mechanism has been shown to be inefficient to explain this
observational fact.
  Aims: We show that low mass accreting T Tauri stars may have a strong stellar
jet component that can effectively brake the star to the observed rotation
speed.
  Methods: By means of a nonlinear separation of the variables in the full set
of the MHD equations we construct semi- analytical solutions describing the
dynamics and topology of the stellar component of the jet that emerges from the
corona of the star.
  Results: We analyze two typical solutions with the same mass loss rate but
different magnetic lever arms and jet radii. The first solution with a long
lever arm and a wide jet radius effectively brakes the star and can be applied
to the visible jets of T Tauri stars, such as RY Tau. The second solution with
a shorter lever arm and a very narrow jet radius may explain why similar stars,
either Weak line T Tauri Stars (WTTS) or Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTS) do not
all have visible jets. For instance, RY Tau itself seems to have different
phases that probably depend on the activity of the star.
  Conclusions: First, stellar jets seem to be able to brake pre-main sequence
stars with a low mass accreting rate. Second, jets may be visible only part
time owing to changes in their boundary conditions. We also suggest a possible
scenario for explaining the dichotomy between CTTS and WTTS, which rotate
faster and do not have visible jets.

observed that are thought to reflect the aggregate electrical activity of the

participate in feedback loops both temporally with the neurons' spikes and
spatially with other brain regions, the mechanisms that might explain the
existence of such loops have remained essentially unknown. Here we present a
theoretical study of these issues on a cortical model we introduced earlier

cortical synaptic-weight distribution. Phys Rev E 81: 021916]. We start with
the definition of two synchronization measures that aim to capture the
synchronization possibilities offered by the model regarding both the overall
spiking activity of the neurons and the spiking activity that causes the
immediate firing of the postsynaptic neurons. We present computational results
on our cortical model, on a model that is random in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi

algorithmic component underlying our cortical model ultimately provides,
through the two synchronization measures, a strong quantitative basis for the
emergence of both types of synchronization in all cases. This, in turn, may
explain the rise both of temporal feedback loops in the neurons' combined
electrical activity and of spatial feedback loops as brain regions that are
spatially separated engage in rhythmic behavior.

gradient descent at each agent and a gossip step that drives the network of
agents to a consensus. Under the assumption of decreasing stepsize, it is
proved that consensus is asymptotically achieved in the network and that the
algorithm converges to the set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points. As an important
feature, the algorithm does not require the double-stochasticity of the gossip
matrices. It is in particular suitable for use in a natural broadcast scenario
for which no feedback messages between agents are required. It is proved that
our result also holds if the number of communications in the network per unit

savings of the network's energy. Applications to power allocation in wireless

  Capacity","final version",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The noncoherent capacity of stationary discrete-time fading channels is known
to be very sensitive to the fine details of the channel model. More
specifically, the measure of the support of the fading-process power spectral
density (PSD) determines if noncoherent capacity grows logarithmically in SNR
or slower than logarithmically. Such a result is unsatisfactory from an
engineering point of view, as the support of the PSD cannot be determined
through measurements. The aim of this paper is to assess whether, for general
continuous-time Rayleigh-fading channels, this sensitivity has a noticeable
impact on capacity at SNR values of practical interest.
  To this end, we consider the general class of band-limited continuous-time
Rayleigh-fading channels that satisfy the wide-sense stationary
uncorrelated-scattering (WSSUS) assumption and are, in addition, underspread.
We show that, for all SNR values of practical interest, the noncoherent
capacity of every channel in this class is close to the capacity of an AWGN
channel with the same SNR and bandwidth, independently of the measure of the
support of the scattering function (the two-dimensional channel PSD). Our
result is based on a lower bound on noncoherent capacity, which is built on a
discretization of the channel input-output relation induced by projecting onto
Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) sets. This approach is interesting in its own right as it
yields a mathematically tractable way of dealing with the mutual information
between certain continuous-time random signals.

of tenets and approaches: phenomenological (descriptive only), well-founded
(solid first principles, conducive to deep understanding), provisional
(falsifiable if universal, verifiable if existential), and imaginary
(fictitious entities or processes, conducive to empirically unsupported
beliefs). The Big-Bang pardigm and the {\Lambda}CDM ""concordance model"" involve
such beliefs: the emanation of the universe out of a non-physical stage, cosmic
inflation (invented ad hoc), {\Lambda} (fictitious energy), and exotic dark
matter. They fail in the confidence check that is required in empirical
science. They also face a problem in delimiting what expands from what does
not. In the more well-founded cosmology that emerges, energy is conserved, the
universe is persistent (not transient) and the 'perfect cosmological principle'
holds. Waves and other perturbations that propagate at c (the escape velocity
from the universe) expand exponentially with distance. This dilatation results
from gravitation. The cosmic web of galaxies does not expand. Potential {\Phi}
varies as -H/(cz) instead of -1/r. Inertial forces arise from gravitational
interaction with the rest of the universe (not with space). They are increased
where the universe appears blueshifted and decreased more than proportionately
at very low accelerations. A cut-off acceleration a0 = 0.168 cH is deduced.
This explains the successful description of galaxy rotation curves by MoND. A
fully elaborated physical theory is still pending. The recycling of energy via
a cosmic ocean filled with photons (the CMB), neutrinos and gravitons, and
wider implications for science, are briefly discussed.

Halperin spin singlet states emerge as specific cases of our construction. The

linear approximation a purely toroidal field always excites pairs of modes with
identical growth rates but with opposite helicity so that the net helicity
vanishes. If the magnetic background field has a helical structure by an extra
(weak) poloidal component then one of the modes dominates producing a net
kinetic helicity anticorrelated to the current helicity of the background

  The mean electromotive force is computed with the result that the \alpha

helicity of the background field. The \alpha effect is found as too small to
drive an \alpha^{2} dynamo but the excitation conditions for an \alpha\Omega
dynamo can be fulfilled for weak poloidal fields. Moreover, if the dynamo
produces its own \alpha effect by the magnetic instability then problems with
its sign do not arise. For all cases, however, the \alpha effect shows an
extremely strong concentration to the poles so that a possible \alpha\Omega
dynamo might only work at the polar regions. Hence, the results of our linear

complexity, both in the \emph{blackboard model} (where each message is written
on a blackboard for all players to see) and (mainly) in the
\emph{message-passing model}, where messages are sent player-to-player. We
introduce a new technique for proving such bounds, called
\emph{symmetrization}, which is natural, intuitive, and often easy to use.
  For example, for the problem where each of $k$ players gets a bit-vector of
length $n$, and the goal is to compute the coordinate-wise XOR of these
vectors, we prove a tight lower bounds of $\Omega(nk)$ in the blackboard model.
For the same problem with AND instead of XOR, we prove a lower bounds of
roughly $\Omega(nk)$ in the message-passing model (assuming $k \le n/3200$) and
$\Omega(n \log k)$ in the blackboard model. We also prove lower bounds for
bit-wise majority, for a graph-connectivity problem, and for other problems;
the technique seems applicable to a wide range of other problems as well. All
of our lower bounds allow randomized communication protocols with two-sided
error.
  We also use the symmetrization technique to prove several direct-sum-like
results for multiparty communication.

the external magnetic field \textbf{H$_{ext}$} inclines to tune interstitial
Fe2 to form FM alignment along \textbf{H$_{ext}$}. When \textbf{H$_{ext}$}
arrives at the ""coercive"" field H$_C$, which is able to break the coupling

sharp drop on resistivity and an anomalous Hall effect. The possible magnetic

discrete S-shaped zero velocity curve. The presence of a bar is also supported
by the residual map between the observed rotation field and a model of circular
orbits in a Plummer potential. The stellar velocity dispersion map presents a
partial ring of low-sigma values (50-60km/s) at 250pc from the nucleus
surrounded by higher sigma values from the galaxy bulge, originated in
kinematically colder regions with recent star formation. The velocity
dispersion of the bulge (100km/s) implies in a black hole mass of
8.3x10^6M_Sun. Emission-line flux distributions are most extended along
PA=27/153deg, reaching at least 450pc from the nucleus and following the
orientation observed in previous optical emission-line [OIII] imaging and radio
jet. The molecular H_2 emission is dominated by thermal processes, mainly due
to X-ray heating by the active nucleus. The [FeII] excitation has a larger
contribution from shocks produced by the radio jet, as evidenced by the
line-ratio maps and velocity dispersion map, which show spatial correlation
with the radio structures. The gaseous kinematics shows two components, one due
to gas located in the galaxy plane and another in outflow, which is oriented
close to the plane of the sky, thus extending to high latitudes, as the galaxy
plane is inclined by 45deg relative to the plane of the sky. The gas rotating
in the plane dominates the H_2 and Pa-beta emission, while the gas in outflow
is observed predominantly in [FeII] emission. From the outflow velocities and
implied geometry, we estimate an outflow mass rate of 6M_sun/yr for the ionised
gas.

It is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of most
of the energy emitted by galaxies. A correct interpretation of star formation
rate (SFR) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxy
formation and evolution. Unfortunately, however, no single SFR estimator is
universally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerous
galaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yield
significant detections with most standard SFR measures, and until now there
have been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span all
the conditions under which star-formation is taking place. To address this need
in a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types of
star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. This project, the Star Formation
Reference Survey (SFRS), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearby
galaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, SFR, and
specific SFR. Furthermore, because the SFRS is blind with respect to AGN
fraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of these
factors on SFR. Our panchromatic global flux measurements (including GALEX
FUV+NUV, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHKs, Spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniform
SFR measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. This
paper describes the SFRS survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents the
multi-band photometry collected to date.

  ladders","8 pages, 19 figures, 1 table",,,,"math.DS math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The experimental study of two kinds of electrical circuits, a domino ladder
and a nested ladder, is presented. While the domino ladder is known and already
appeared in the theory of fractional-order systems, the nested ladder circuit
is presented in this article for the first time. For fitting the measured data,
a new approach is suggested, which is based on using the Mittag-Leffler
function and which means that the data are fitted by a solution of an
initial-value problem for a two-term fractional differential equation. The
experiment showed that in the frequency domain the domino ladder behaves as a
system of order 0.5 and the nested ladder as a system of order 0.25, which is
in perfect agreement with the theory developed for their design. In the time
domain, however, the order of the domino ladder is changing from roughly 0.5 to
almost 1, and the order of the nested ladder is changing in a similar manner,
from roughly 0.25 to almost 1; in both cases, the order 1 is never reached, and
both systems remain the systems of non-integer order less than 1. Both studied
types of electrical circuits provide the first known examples of circuits,
which are made of passive elements only and which exhibit in the time domain
the behavior of variable order.

stick-slip instabilities. Here a distinct, quasi-static mechanism is evidenced
leading to quasi-periodic force oscillations during sliding contact between an
elastomer block, whose surface is patterned with parallel grooves, and finely
abraded glass slides. The dominant oscillation frequency is set by the ratio
between the sliding velocity and the period of the grooves. A mechanical model
is proposed that provides a quantitative prediction for the amplitude of the
force modulations as a function of the normal load, the period of the grooves
and the roughness characteristics of the substrate. The model's main ingredient
is the non-linearity of the friction law. Since such non-linearity is
ubiquitous for soft solids, this ""fingerprint effect"" should be relevant to a
large class of frictional configurations and might in particular have important
consequences in human (or humanoid) active digital touch.

demonstrated that for any module $M$ in $\mathcal{F}$ the rate of growth of the
minimal projective resolution (i.e., the complexity of $M$) is bounded by the
dimension of $\mathfrak{g}_{\bar{1}}$. In this paper we compute the complexity
of the simple modules and the Kac modules for the Lie superalgebra
$\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$. In both cases we show that the complexity is related to

effect and magnetic neutron diffraction carried out on single crystals of
antiferromagnetic Yb$_{3}$Pt$_{4}$, where highly localized Yb moments order at
$T_{\rm N}=2.4$ K in zero field. The antiferromagnetic order was suppressed to
$T_{\rm N}\rightarrow 0$ by applying a field of 1.85 T in the $ab$ plane.
Magnetocaloric effect measurements show that the antiferromagnetic phase
transition is always continuous for $T_{\rm N}>0$, although a pronounced step
in the magnetization is observed at the critical field in both neutron
diffraction and magnetization measurements. These steps sharpen with decreasing
temperature, but the related divergences in the magnetic susceptibility are cut
off at the lowest temperatures, where the phase line itself becomes vertical in
the field-temperature plane. As $T_{\rm N}\rightarrow0$, the antiferromagnetic
transition is increasingly influenced by a quantum critical endpoint, where
$T_{\rm N}$ ultimately vanishes in a first order phase transition.

scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) from first principles. Our approach
provides bias dependent STM images in high spatial resolution, with the
capability of using either constant current or constant height modes of STM. In
addition, topographic and magnetic contributions can clearly be distinguished,
which are directly comparable to results of SP-STM experiments in the
differential magnetic mode. Advantages of the proposed method are that it is
computationally cheap, it is easy to parallelize, and it can employ the results
of any ab initio electronic structure code. Its capabilities are illustrated
for the prototype frustrated hexagonal antiferromagnetic system, Cr monolayer
on Ag(111) in a noncollinear magnetic $120^{\circ}$ N\'eel state. We show
evidence that the magnetic contrast is sensitive to the tip electronic
structure, and this contrast can be reversed depending on the bias voltage.
