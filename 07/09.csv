states in a non-translationally invariant system. For this, we present the case
of a hierarchical lattice and incorporate long range interactions that are also
distributed in a hierarchical fashion. We show that it is possible to
explicitly construct eigenstates with constant amplitudes (normalized to unity)
at every lattice point for special values of the electron- energy. However, the
end-to-end transmission, corresponding to the above energy of the electron in
such a hierarchical system depends strongly on a special correlation between
the numerical values of the parameters of the Hamiltonian. Keeping the energy
and the distribution of the amplitudes invariant, one can transform the lattice
from conducting to insulating simply by tunning the numerical values of the
long range interaction. The values of these interactions themselves display a
fractal character.

detect additional planets in transiting exoplanetary systems. In this paper we
show how transiting planets with significant TTVs can be systematically missed,
or cataloged as false positives, by current transit search algorithms, unless
they are in multi-transit systems. If the period of the TTVs, P_TTV, is longer
than the time baseline of the observations and its amplitude, A_TTV, is larger
than the timing precision limit of the data, transiting planet candidates are
still detected, but with incorrect ephemerides. Therefore, they will be
discarded during follow-up. When P_TTV is shorter than the time baseline of the
observations and A_TTV is sufficiently large, constant period search algorithms
find an average period for the system, which results in altered transit
durations and depths in the folded light curves. Those candidates can get
subsequently discarded as eclipsing binaries, grazing eclipses, or blends.
Also, for large enough A_TTVs, the transits can get fully occulted by the
photometric dispersion of the light curves. These detection biases could
explain the observed statistical differences between the frequency of multiple
systems among planets detected via other techniques and those detected via
transits. We suggest that new transit search algorithms allowing for
non-constant period planets should be implemented.

characterization of compact sets as those contained in the convex hull of a

concepts of $p$-approximation property and $p$-compact operators, which form a
ideal with its ideal norm $\kappa_p$. This paper examines the interaction
between the $p$-approximation property and the space of holomorphic functions.
Here, the $p$-compact analytic functions play a crucial role. In order to
understand this type of functions we define a $p$-compact radius of convergence
which allow us to give a characterization of the functions in the class. We
show that $p$-compact holomorphic functions behave more like nuclear than
compact maps. We use the $\epsilon$-product, defined by Schwartz, to
characterize the $p$-approximation property of a Banach space in terms of
$p$-compact homogeneous polynomials and also in terms of $p$-compact
holomorphic functions with range on the space. Finally, we show that
$p$-compact holomorphic functions fit in the framework of holomorphy types
which allows us to inspect the $\kappa_p$-approximation property. Along these
notes we solve several questions posed by Aron, Maestre and Rueda in [2].

their thermal emission in X-rays they are important to study NS cooling and to
probe theoretical cooling models. Hence, a precise determination of their age
is essential. Recently, new parallax measurements of RXJ1856 and RXJ0720 were
obtained. Considering that NSs may originate from binary systems that got
disrupted due to an asymmetric supernova, we attempt to identify runaway stars
which may have been former companions to the NS progenitors. Such an
identification would strongly support a particular birth scenario with time and
place. We trace back each NS, runaway star and the centres of possible birth
associations to find close encounters. The kinematic age is then given by the
time since the encounter. We use Monte Carlo simulations to account for
observational uncertainties. Using the most recent parallax measurement of
8.16+/-0.80 mas for RXJ1856, we find that it originated in the U Sco
association 0.46+/-0.05 Myr ago. This is slightly larger than the value we
reported earlier (0.3 Myr). Our result is strongly supported by its current
radial velocity that we predict to be 6+19-20 km/s. This implies an inclination
angle of 88+/-6 deg consistent with the bow shock. No suitable runaway star was
found to be a potential former companion of RXJ1856. Making use of a recent
parallax measurement for RXJ0720 of 3.6+/-1.6 mas, we find that this NS was
possibly born in Tr 10 0.85+/-0.15 Myr ago. This is somewhat larger than the
one obtained using the old parallax value (0.5 Myr). We suggest the B0 runaway
supergiant HIP 43158 as a candidate for a former companion. Then, the current
distance of RXJ0720 to the Sun should be 286+27-23 pc, in agreement with recent
measurements. We then expect the radial velocity of RXJ0720 to be -76+34-17
km/s.

more pulsars with stable repetition rates. (Each pulsar emits pulses at a fixed
repetition period in its rest frame.) The positioning system uses the fact that
an event in spacetime can be fully described by emission coordinates: the
proper emission time of each pulse measured at the event. The proper emission
time of each pulse from four different pulsars---interpolated as
necessary---provides the four spacetime coordinates of the reception event in
the emission coordinate system. If more than four pulsars are available, the
redundancy can improve the accuracy of the determination and/or resolve
degeneracies resulting from special geometrical arrangements of the sources and
the event.
  We introduce a robust numerical approach to measure the emission coordinates
of an event in any arbitrary spacetime geometry. Our approach uses a continuous
solution of the eikonal equation describing the backward null cone from the
event. The pulsar proper time at the instant the null cone intersects the
pulsar world line is one of the four required coordinates. The process is
complete (modulo degeneracies) when four pulsar world lines have been crossed
by the light cone.
  The numerical method is applied in two different examples: measuring emission
coordinates of an event in Minkowski spacetime using pulses from four pulsars
stationary in the spacetime; and measuring emission coordinates of an event in
Schwarzschild spacetime using pulses from four pulsars freely falling toward a
static black hole.
  These numerical simulations are merely exploratory, but with improved
resolution and computational resources the method can be applied to more
pertinent problems. For instance one could measure the emission coordinates,
and therefore the trajectory, of the Earth.

fundamental problem in database management. In recent years, due to many of its
modern applications, there has been significant interest to address the
distinct counting problem in a data stream setting, where each incoming data
can be seen only once and cannot be stored for long periods of time. Many
probabilistic approaches based on either sampling or sketching have been
proposed in the computer science literature, that only require limited
computing and memory resources. However, the performances of these methods are
not scale-invariant, in the sense that their relative root mean square
estimation errors (RRMSE) depend on the unknown cardinalities. This is not
desirable in many applications where cardinalities can be very dynamic or
inhomogeneous and many cardinalities need to be estimated. In this paper, we
develop a novel approach, called self-learning bitmap (S-bitmap) that is
scale-invariant for cardinalities in a specified range. S-bitmap uses a binary
vector whose entries are updated from 0 to 1 by an adaptive sampling process
for inferring the unknown cardinality, where the sampling rates are reduced
sequentially as more and more entries change from 0 to 1. We prove rigorously
that the S-bitmap estimate is not only unbiased but scale-invariant. We
demonstrate that to achieve a small RRMSE value of $\epsilon$ or less, our
approach requires significantly less memory and consumes similar or less
operations than state-of-the-art methods for many common practice cardinality
scales. Both simulation and experimental studies are reported.

spectrograph covering the 300 - 2480 nm spectral range at once with a high
resolving power. These properties enticed us to observe (136199) Eris during
the science verification of the instrument. The target has numerous absorption
features in the optical and near-infrared domain which has been observed by
different authors, showing differences in their positions and strengths.
  We attempt at constraining the existence of super-volatiles, e.g., CH4, CO
and N2, and in particular try to understand the physical-chemical state of the
ices on Eris' surface.
  We observed Eris in the 300-2480 nm range and compared the newly obtained
spectra with those available in the literature. We identified several
absorption features, measuring their positions and depth and compare them with
those of reflectance of pure methane ice obtained from the optical constants of
this ice at 30 K to study shifts in their positions and find a possible
explanation for their origin.
  We identify several absorption bands in the spectrum all consistent with the
presence of CH4 ice. We do not identify bands related with N2 or CO. We
measured the central wavelengths of the bands and find variable shifts, with
respect to the spectrum of pure CH4 at 30 K. Conclusions. Based on these
wavelength shifts we confirm the presence of a dilution of CH4 in other ice on
the surface of Eris and the presence of pure CH4 spatially segregated. The
comparison of the centers and shapes of these bands with previous works suggest
that the surface is heterogeneous. The absence of the 2160 nm band of N2 can be
explained if the surface temperature is below 35.6 K, the transition
temperature between the alpha and beta phases of this ice. Our results,
including the reanalysis of data published elsewhere, point to an heterogeneous
surface on Eris.

particles (ALPs). As in ordinary photon-regeneration (light shining through a
wall) experiments, a laser beam traverses a region permeated by a magnetic
field, where photons are converted to ALPs via the Primakoff process, resulting
in a slight power loss and phase shift. The beam is then combined with a
reference beam that originates from the same source. The detection of a change
in the output intensity would signal the presence of ALPs (or possibly other
particles that couple to the photon in a similar way). Because only one stage
of conversion is needed, the signal is of ${\cal O}(g^2_{a\gamma \gamma})$, as
opposed to ${\cal O}(g^4_{a\gamma \gamma})$ for photon-regeneration
experiments, where $g_{a\gamma \gamma}$ is the coupling between ALPs and
photons. This improvement over photon-regeneration is nullified by the presence
of shot noise, which however can be reduced by the use of squeezed light,
resulting in an improvement in the sensitivity to $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ over
ordinary photon-regeneration experiments by an order of $10^{1/2}$ assuming
$10{\rm dB}$ noise suppression. Additionally, our setup can incorporate
straightforwardly optical delay lines or Fabry-Perot cavities, boosting the
signal by a factor of $n\sim10^3$, where $n$ is the number of times the laser
beam is folded. This way, we can constrain $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ better by yet
another factor of $n^{1/2}\sim 10^{1.5}$, as compared to the $n^{1/4}$ boost

the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We compute hydrogen reionization
histories, CMB optical depths and anisotropy power spectra for a range of
stellar populations including dark stars. If dark stars capture large amounts
of dark matter via nuclear scattering, reionization can be substantially
delayed, leading to decreases in the integrated optical depth to last
scattering and large-scale power in the EE polarization power spectrum. Using
the integrated optical depth observed by WMAP7, in our canonical reionization
model we rule out the section of parameter space where dark stars with high
scattering-induced capture rates tie up more than ~90% of all the first
star-forming baryons, and live for over ~250 Myr. When nuclear scattering
delivers only moderate amounts of dark matter, reionization can instead be sped
up slightly, modestly increasing the CMB optical depth. If dark stars do not
obtain any dark matter via nuclear scattering, effects upon reionization and
the CMB are negligible. The effects of dark stars upon reionization and its CMB
markers can be largely mimicked or compensated for by changes in the existing
parameters of reionization models, making dark stars difficult to disentangle
from astrophysical uncertainties, but also widening the range of standard
parameters in reionization models that can be made consistent with
observations.

infrared dust emission and local dust-to-gas ratios, we construct a map of
molecular gas that is independent of CO emission. This allows us to disentangle
conversion factor effects from the impact of metallicity on the formation and
star formation efficiency of molecular gas. On scales of 200 pc to 1 kpc we
find a characteristic molecular gas depletion time of ~1.6 Gyr, similar to that
observed in the molecule-rich parts of large spiral galaxies on similar spatial
scales. This depletion time shortens on much larger scales to ~0.6 Gyr because
of the presence of a diffuse H-alpha component, and lengthens on much smaller
scales to ~7.5 Gyr because the H-alpha and H2 distributions differ in detail.
We estimate the systematic uncertainties in our measurement to be a factor of
2-3. We suggest that the impact of metallicity on the physics of star formation
in molecular gas has at most this magnitude. The relation between SFR and
neutral (H2+HI) gas surface density is steep, with a power-law index
~2.2+/-0.1, similar to that observed in the outer disks of large spiral
galaxies. At a fixed total gas surface density the SMC has a 5-10 times lower
molecular gas fraction (and star formation rate) than large spiral galaxies. We
explore the ability of the recent models by Krumholz et al. (2009) and Ostriker
et al. (2010) to reproduce our observations. We find that to explain our data
at all spatial scales requires a low fraction of cold, gravitationally-bound
gas in the SMC. We explore a combined model that incorporates both large scale
thermal and dynamical equilibrium and cloud-scale photodissociation region
structure and find that it reproduces our data well, as well as predicting a
fraction of cold atomic gas very similar to that observed in the SMC.

to have a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition while
simultaneously relaxing the tension with EDM experiments. The R-symmetry (and
its small breaking) implies that the gauginos (and the neutralino LSP) are
pseudo-Dirac fermions, which is relevant for both baryogenesis and DM. The
singlet superpartner of the U(1)_Y pseudo-Dirac gaugino plays a prominent role
in making the electroweak phase transition strongly first-order. The
pseudo-Dirac nature of the LSP allows it to behave similarly to a Dirac
particle during freeze-out, but like a Majorana particle for annihilation today
and in scattering against nuclei, thus being consistent with current
constraints. Assuming a standard cosmology, it is possible to simultaneously
have a strongly first-order phase transition conducive to baryogenesis and have
the LSP provide the full DM relic abundance, in part of the allowed parameter
space. However, other possibilities for DM also exist, which are discussed. It
is expected that upcoming direct DM searches as well as neutrino signals from
DM annihilation in the Sun will be sensitive to this class of models.

a (3+\eps)-approximation to the minimum Fr\'echet distance over all possible

illustrate the properties of the associated relativistic description of distant
observers within the example of a $\kappa$-Poincar\'e-inspired momentum-space
geometry, with de Sitter metric and parallel transport governed by a non-metric

massless particles do not reach simultaneously a distant detector, as expected
in light of the findings of arXiv:1103.5626 on the implications of non-metric

the relative-locality results of arXiv:1102.4637 are reproduced. We establish
that the torsion of the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e connection introduces a small (but

discussed in detail. It is demonstrated that the radial migration of stars does
not lead to appreciable distortions in the age dependence of the metallicity.
During the first several billion years of the formation of the thin disk, the
interstellar material in this disk was, on average, fairly rich in heavy
elements (<[Fe/H]> ~-0.2) and poorly mixed. However, the metallicity dispersion
continuously decreased with age, from \sigma_{[Fe/H]}~0.22 to ~0.13. All this
time, the mean relative abundance of Mg was somewhat higher than the solar
value (<[Mg/Fe]>~0.1). Roughly four to five billion years ago, the mean
metallicity began to systematically increase, while retaining the same
dispersion; the mean relative Mg abundance began to decrease immediately
following this. The number of stars in this subsystem increased sharply at the
same time. These properties suggest that the star-formation rate was low in the
initial stage of formation of the thin disk, but abruptly increased about four
to five billion years ago.

candidates appear in different types of SGRB host galaxy environments and show
no clear correlation with the X-ray afterglow lifetime; flare candidates are
detected both in SGRBs with a bright extended emission in the soft gamma-rays
and in SGRBs which do not show such component. We furthermore show that SGRB
X-ray flare candidates only partially share the set of observational properties
of long GRB (LGRB) flares. In particular,the main parameter driving the
duration evolution of X-ray variability episodes in both classes is found to be
the elapsed time from the explosion, with very limited dependence on the
different progenitors, environments, central engine life-times, prompt
variability time-scales and energy budgets. On the contrary, SGRB flare
candidates significantly differ from LGRB flares in terms of peak luminosity,
isotropic energy, flare-to-prompt luminosity ratio and relative variability
flux. However, these differences disappear when the central engine time-scales
and energy budget are accounted for, suggesting that (i) flare candidates and
prompt pulses in SGRBs likely have a common origin; (ii) similar dissipation
and/or emission mechanisms are responsible for the prompt and flare emission in
long and short GRBs, with SGRBs being less energetic albeit faster evolving
versions of the long class. Finally, we show that in strict analogy to the SGRB
prompt emission, flares candidates fall off the lag-luminosity relation defined
by LGRBs, thus strengthening the SGRB flare-prompt pulse connection.

energy is small compared to the transverse energy scales. Our approach provides
a straightforward way, first, to derive corrections to the transverse and

obtained from the COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs on board the twin STEREO
spacecraft, as also the eruptive prominences (EPs) associated with three of
them using images from the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI). A feature in the
EPs and leading edges (LEs) of all the CMEs was identified and tracked in
images from the two spacecraft, and a stereoscopic reconstruction technique was
used to determine the 3D coordinates of these features. True velocity and
acceleration were determined from the temporal evolution of the true height of
the CME features. Our study of kinematics of the CMEs in 3D reveals that the
CME leading edge undergoes maximum acceleration typically below 2R$_\{odot}$.
The acceleration profiles of CMEs associated with flares and prominences
exhibit different behaviour. While the CMEs not associated with prominences
show a bimodal acceleration profile, those associated with prominences do not.
Two of the three associated prominences in the study show a high and rising
value of acceleration up to a distance of almost 4R$_\{odot}$ but acceleration
of the corresponding CME LE does not show the same behaviour, suggesting that
the two may not be always driven by the same mechanism. One of the CMEs,
although associated with a C-class flare showed unusually high acceleration of
over 1500 m s$^{-2}$. Our results therefore suggest that only the
flare-associated CMEs undergo residual acceleration, which indicates that the
flux injection theoretical model holds good for the flare-associated CMEs, but
a different mechanism should be considered for EP-associated CMEs.

carbon stars, using a generalized description of radiative cross sections valid
for particles of arbitrary sizes. The purpose of the study is to investigate
under which circumstances the small particle limit (SPL) may give acceptable
results, and to quantify the possible errors that may occur when it does not
hold. The time-dependent description of grain growth in our detailed
radiation-hydrodynamical models gives information about dust particle radii in
every layer at every instant of time. These grain radii are used for computing
opacities and determining the radiative acceleration of the dust-gas mixture.
It is shown that in the critical cases the effect of the generalized
description of dust opacities can be significant, resulting in more intense
mass loss and higher wind velocities compared to models using SPL opacities.
For well-developed winds, however, grain size effects on mass loss rates and
wind velocities are found to be small. Both groups of models tend towards lower
degrees of dust condensation compared to corresponding SPL models, due to a
self-regulating feedback between grain growth and radiative acceleration.
Consequently, the ""dust-loss rates"" are lower in the models with the
generalized treatment of grain opacities. We conclude that our previous results
on mass loss rates obtained with SPL opacities are reliable within a wide
region of stellar parameter space, except for critical cases close to
thresholds of dust-driven outflows where SPL models will tend to underestimate
the mass loss rates and wind velocities.

properties (luminosity functions, mass, size, ages, etc) of optically selected
compact stellar objects (knots) in a representative sample of 32 low-z
(U)LIRGs. We use ACS images from the Hubble Space Telescope in F435W and F814W
bands. The galaxies in the sample represent different interaction phases and
cover a wide luminosity range (11.46 \leq log (L_IR (Lsun)) \leq 12.54). With a
median size of 32 pc, most of the nearly 3000 knots detected consists of
complexes of star clusters. Some of the knots (~15%) are so blue that their
colors indicate a young (i.e., < 30 Myr) and almost extinction-free population.
There is a clear correlation of the mass of these blue knots with their radius,
M \propto R^{1.91\pm0.14}, similar to that found in complexes of clusters in
M51 and in Giant Molecular Clouds. This suggests that the star formation within
the knots is proportional to the gas density at any given radius. The star
formation of all the knots is characterized by luminosity functions (LFs) of
the knots with slopes close to 2. Though, we see a marginally significant
indication that the LF evolves with the interaction process, becoming steeper
from early to advanced merger phases. Due to size-of-sample effects we are
probably sampling knots in ULIRGs intrinsically more luminous (x4) than in less
luminous systems. They also have sizes and are likely to have masses
characteristic of clumps in galaxies at z \gtrsim 1. Knots in post-mergers are
on average larger (x 1.3-2), more luminous (2 mag) in the I-band, and 0.5 mag
redder than those in systems in earlier phases. Two scenarios are briefly
discussed: (1) the likely presence of relatively high extinction in the most
advanced mergers; (2) the dissolution of the less massive clusters and/or their
coalescence into more massive, evolved superclusters.

EuTiO3 nanowires and generated the phase diagrams in coordinates of temperature
and wire radii. The calculations were performed within the
Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory with phenomenological parameters extracted
from tabulated experimental data and first principles calculations. Since bulk
EuTiO3 is antiferromagnetic at temperatures lower than 5.5 K and paraelectric
at all temperatures, our goal was to investigate the possibility of inducing
the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties of EuTiO3 by reducing the bulk
to nanosystems. Our results indicate that ferroelectric spontaneous
polarization of ~0.1-0.5C/m2 is induced in EuTiO3 nanowires due to the
intrinsic surface stress, which is inversely proportional to the nanowire
radius. The spontaneous polarization exists at temperatures lower than 300 K,
for the wire radius less than 1 nm and typical surface stress coefficients ~ 15
N/m. Due to the strong biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling, the spontaneous
polarization in turn induces the ferromagnetic phase at temperatures lower than
30 K for 2 nm nanowire, and at temperatures lower than 10 K for 4 nm nanowire
in EuTiO3. Thus we predicted that the EuTiO3 nanowires can be the new
ferroelectric-ferromagnetic multiferroic.

wavelengths for the corona, exists in the chromosphere for rapidly rotating
late-type stars. Moderate resolution optical spectra of fast rotating EUV- and
X-ray- selected late-type stars were obtained. Stars in alpha Per were observed
in the northern hemisphere with the Isaac Newton 2.5 m telescope and IDS
spectrograph. Selected objects from IC 2391 and IC 2602 were observe in the
southern hemisphere with the Blanco 4m telescope and R-C spectrograph at CTIO.
Ca II H & K fluxes were measured for all stars in our sample. We find the
saturation level for Ca II K at log(L_CaK/L_bol) = -4.08. The Ca II K flux does
not show a decrease as a function of increased rotational velocity or smaller
Rossby number as observed in the X-ray. This lack of ""super-saturation""
supports the idea of coronal-stripping as the cause of saturation and
super-saturation in stellar chromospheres and corona, but the detailed
underlying mechanism is still under investigation.

  Process","21 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-fin.TR math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study an optimal execution problem in the presence of market impact where
the security price follows a geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which
implies the mean-reverting property, and show that the optimal strategy is a
mixture of initial/terminal block liquidation and gradual intermediate
liquidation. The mean-reverting property describes a price recovery effect that
is strongly related to the resilience of market impact, as described in several
papers that have studied optimal execution in a limit order book (LOB) model.
It is interesting that despite the fact that the model in this paper is
different from the LOB model, the form of our optimal strategy is quite similar
to those obtained for an LOB model. Moreover, we discuss what properties cause
gradual liquidation as an optimal strategy by studying various cases and find
out that not only ""convexity of market impact function"" but also ""price
recovery effect"" (or, in other words, transience of market impact) are
essential to make a trader execute the security gradually to mitigate the
effect of market impact.

skyscraper? Most practical structures are designed so that long wave resonance
vibrations can be avoided. However, there are recent examples, such as the
Millennium Bridge in London or the Volga Bridge in Volgograd, which show that
unexpected external forces may result in large scale unwanted shake and rattle.
Full scale alteration of a bridge (or a skyscraper) would not be considered as
an acceptable option, unless the structure has collapsed. Can we fix this by
examining a representative part of the structure only and making small
lightweight changes? We will do it here and illustrate an idea linking the
engineering analysis to elastic waveguides.

on variational principles for the ubiquitous I-beam with thin flanges under
uniform bending is presented. The resulting system of differential and integral
equations are solved using numerical continuation techniques such that the
response far into the post-buckling range can be portrayed. The interaction
between global lateral-torsional buckling of the beam and local buckling of the
flange plate is found to oblige the buckling deformation to localize initially
at the beam midspan with subsequent cellular buckling (snaking) being predicted
theoretically for the first time. Solutions from the model compare very
favourably with a series of classic experiments and some newly conducted tests
which also exhibit the predicted sequence of localized followed by cellular
buckling.

clarifies some aspects of the theory of dependence structure of Markov chains

applied fields. The main aim of this paper is to clarify the relationship
between the notions of geometric ergodicity and geometric {\rho}-mixing;
namely, to point out that for a large number of well known copulas, such as
Clayton, Gumbel or Student, these notions are equivalent. Some of the results
published in the last years appear to be redundant if one takes into account
this fact. We apply this equivalence to show that any mixture of Clayton,
Gumbel or Student copulas generate both geometrically ergodic and geometric
{\rho}-mixing stationary Markov chains, answering in this way an open question
in the literature. We shall also point out that a sufficient condition for
{\rho}-mixing, used in the literature, actually implies Doeblin recurrence.

approach to the GravitoElectroMagnetism (GEM) approximation of gravity. GVT is
a generally covariant theory of gravity composed of a pseudo Riemannian metric
and two U(1) gauge connections that reproduces MOND in the limit of very weak
gravitational fields while remains consistent with the Einstein-Hilbert gravity
in the limit of strong and Newtonian gravitational fields. GVT also provides a
simple framework to study the GEM approximation to gravity. We illustrate that
the gravitomagnetic force at the edge of a galaxy can be in accord with either
GVT or \Lambda CDM but not both. We also study the physics of the GVT theory
around the gravitational saddle point of the Sun and Jupiter system. We notice
that the conclusive refusal of the GVT theory demands measuring either both of
the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields inside the Sun-Jupiter MOND
window, or the gravitoelectric field inside two different solar GVT MOND
windows. The GVT theory, however, will be favored by observing an anomaly in
the gravitoelectric field inside a single MOND window.
