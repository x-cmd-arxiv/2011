hierarchy problem of the electroweak scale. Having motivated this model with
naturalness arguments, it is then necessary to check whether the experimentally
allowed parameter space permits realisations of the model with low fine tuning.
The scope of this thesis is a study of naturalness of the electroweak physics
in the minimal supergravity model. The latest experimental constraints are
applied, and the fine tuning is quantitatively evaluated for a scan across the
parameter space. The fine tuning of the electroweak scale is evaluated at
2-loop order, and the fine tuning of the neutralino dark matter thermal relic
energy density is also determined. The natural regions of the parameter space
are identified and the associated phenomenology relevant for detection
discussed. Naturalness limits are also found for the parameter space and
spectrum. The minimum fine tuning found is 1 part in 9 when dark matter
constraints are neglected, and 1 part in 15 when dark matter constraints are
satisfied. For both cases, the minimum fine tuning is found for a Higgs mass of
115 GeV irrespective of whether the Higgs mass constraint is applied or not.
The most natural spectrum includes light superpartner fermions, and heavy
superpartner scalars. Minimal supergravity currently remains viable with
respect to naturalness and a natural realisation may be discovered within the
next couple of years.

us to ask whether such indirect observations are capable of diagnosing which
types of galaxies were most responsible for reionization. We attempt to answer
this by considering a set of large-scale radiative transfer simulations of
reionization in sufficiently large volumes to make statistically meaningful
predictions of observable signatures, while also directly resolving all
atomically-cooling halos down to 10^8 M_solar. We focus here on predictions of
the 21-cm background, to see if upcoming observations are capable of
distinguishing a universe ionized primarily by high-mass halos from one in
which both high-mass and low-mass halos are responsible, and to see how these
results depend upon the uncertain source efficiencies. We find that 21-cm
fluctuation power spectra observed by the first generation EoR/21-cm radio
interferometer arrays should be able to distinguish the case of reionization by
high-mass halos alone from that by both high- and low-mass halos, together.
Some reionization scenarios yield very similar power spectra and rms evolution
and thus can only be discriminated by their different mean reionization history
and 21-cm PDF distributions. We find that the skewness of the 21-cm PDF
distribution smoothed over LOFAR-like window shows a clear feature correlated
with the rise of the rms due to patchiness. Measurements of the mean
photoionization rates are sensitive to the average density of the regions being
studied and therefore could be strongly skewed in certain cases. (abridged)

stimuli in order to accomplish their functional tasks; these tasks range from
wound healing to immune response to fertilization. While the directional motion
is typically dictated by an external signal, the actual motility is also
restricted by physical constraints, such as the presence of other cells and the
extracellular matrix. The ability to successfully navigate in the presence of
obstacles is not only essential for organisms, but might prove relevant in the
study of autonomous robotic motion.
  Methodology/principal findings: We study a computational model of amoeboid
chemotactic navigation under differing conditions, from motion in an
obstacle-free environment to navigation between obstacles and finally to moving
in a maze. We use the maze as a simple stand-in for a motion task with severe
constraints, as might be expected in dense extracellular matrix. Whereas agents
using simple chemotaxis can successfully navigate around small obstacles, the
presence of large barriers can often lead to agent trapping. We further show
that employing a simple memory mechanism, namely secretion of a repulsive
chemical by the agent, helps the agent escape from such trapping.
  Conclusions/significance: Our main conclusion is that cells employing simple
chemotactic strategies will often be unable to navigate through maze-like
geometries, but a simple chemical marker mechanism (which we refer to as
""self-assistance"") significantly improves success rates. This realization
provides important insights into mechanisms that might be employed by real
cells migrating in complex environments as well as clues for the design of
robotic navigation strategies. The results can be extended to more complicated
multi-cellular systems and can be used in the study of mammalian cell migration
and cancer metastasis.

the distance from the edge; at the Dirac points one of these lengths diverges,

trace this curious effect to the doubling of the unit cell along the edge,
brought about by the edge reconstruction. In the presence of a magnetic field,
the zero-energy Landau level is no longer degenerate with edge states as in the

types of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, and botnets. To reduce the
probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in self-defense
mechanisms like antivirus and antispam software. However, such software does
not completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of
residual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In reality,
an Internet user faces risks due to security attacks as well as risks due to
non-security related failures (e.g., reliability faults in the form of hardware
crash, buffer overflow, etc.) . These risk types are often indistinguishable by
a naive user. However, a cyber-insurance agency would most likely insure risks
only due to security attacks. In this case, it becomes a challenge for an
Internet user to choose the right type of cyber-insurance contract as standard
optimal contracts, i.e., contracts under security attacks only, might prove to
be sub-optimal for himself. In this paper, we address the problem of analyzing
cyber-insurance solutions when a user faces risks due to both, security as well
as non-security related failures. We propose \emph{Aegis}, a novel
cyber-insurance model in which the user accepts a fraction \emph{(strictly
positive)} of loss recovery on himself and transfers rest of the loss recovery
on the cyber-insurance agency. We mathematically show that given an option,
Internet users would prefer Aegis contracts to traditional cyber-insurance
contracts, under all premium types. This result firmly establishes the
non-existence of traditional cyber-insurance markets when Aegis contracts are
offered to users.

described in terms of a two-state fluctuation model involving local structures

signals are chosen uniformly randomly with unit energy, a model applicable to
several modern transmission systems. It is shown that by lifting (replicating)
the graph of this system and randomizing the graph connections, a simple
iterative cancellation demodulator can be constructed which achieves the same
performance as an optimal symbol-by-symbol detector of the original system. The
iterative detector has a complexity that is linear in the number of users,
while the direct optimal approach is known to be NP-hard. However, the maximal
system load of this lifted graph is limited to \alpha<2.07, even for
signal-to-noise ratios going to infinity - the system is interference limited.
We then show that by introducing spatial coupling between subsequent lifted
graphs, and anchoring the initial graphs, this limitation can be avoided and
arbitrary system loads are achievable. Our results apply to several
well-documented system proposals, such as IDMA, partitioned spreading, and
certain forms of MIMO communications.

  H2-bearing cloud","15 pages, 15 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19489.x",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a detailed analysis of the partial coverage of the Q1232+082 (z_em
=2.57) broad line region by an intervening H_2-bearing cloud at z_abs=2.3377.
Using curve of growth analysis and line profile fitting, we demonstrate that
the H_2-bearing component of the cloud covers the QSO intrinsic continuum
source completely but only part of the Broad Line Region (BLR). We find that
only 48\pm6 % of the C IV BLR emission is covered by the C I absorbing gas. We
observe residual light (~6 %) as well in the bottom of the O I {\lambda}1302
absorption from the cloud, redshifted on top of the QSO Lyman-{\alpha} emission
line. Therefore the extent of the neutral phase of the absorbing cloud is not
large enough to cover all of the background source. The most likely explanation
for this partial coverage is the small size of the intervening cloud, which is
comparable to the BLR size. We estimate the number densities in the cloud:
n_H2~110 cm^{-3} for the H_2-bearing core and n_H ~30 cm^{-3} for the neutral
envelope. Given the column densities, N(H2)=(3.71\pm0.97)\times10^19 cm^{-2}
and N(H I)=(7.94\pm1.6)\times10^20 cm^{-2}, we derive the linear size of the
H_2-bearing core and the neutral envelope along the line of sight to be
l_H2~0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.05} pc and l_HI~8.2^{+6.5}_{-4.1} pc, respectively. We
estimate the size of the C IV BLR by two ways (i) extrapolating size-luminosity
relations derived from reverberation observations and (ii) assuming that the
H_2-bearing core and the BLR are spherical in shape and the results are ~0.26
and ~0.18 pc, respectively. The large size we derive for the extent of the
neutral phase of the absorbing cloud together with a covering factor of ~0.94
of the Lyman-{\alpha} emission means that the Lyman-{\alpha} BLR is probably
fully covered but that the Lyman-{\alpha} emission extends well beyond the
limits of the BLR.

time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE) using explicit finite-differencing

time and both second-order and fourth-order central differencing in space.
Results are given for Dirichlet, modulus-squared Dirichlet, Laplacian-zero, and
periodic boundary conditions for one, two, and three dimensions. Our approach
is to use standard Runge-Kutta linear stability theory, treating the
nonlinearity of the NLSE as a constant. The required bounds on the eigenvalues
of the scheme matrices are found analytically when possible, and otherwise
estimated using the Gershgorin circle theorem.

characterize the amplifier response to quantum and deliberately applied
fluctuations, both optical and mechanical. Further, we apply these results to
establish quantum limits on external force sensing both on and off cavity
resonance. We find that the maximum sensitivity attained on resonance
constitutes an absolute upper limit, not surpassed when detuning off cavity
resonance. The theory can be extended to a two-sided cavity with losses and

example, we show that, if $C_{\mathbb{R},n}$ and $C_{\mathbb{C},n}$ denote

$$\frac{C_{\mathbb{R},n}}{\sqrt{\pi}} = \frac{C_{\mathbb{C},n}}{\sqrt{2}} =
2^{\frac{n+2}{8}}\cdot r_n$$ for a certain sequence $\{r_n\}$ which we estimate
numerically to belong to the interval $(1,3/2)$ (the case $n$ odd is similar).
Simultaneously, assuming that $\{r_n\}$ is in fact convergent, we also conclude
that $$\displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}

amyloid plaques. Our incomplete understanding of this process underscores the
need to decipher the principles governing protein aggregation. Most
experimental and simulation studies have been interpreted largely from the
perspective of proteins: the role of solvent has been relatively overlooked.
  In this Account, we provide a perspective on how interactions with water
affect folding landscapes of A$\beta$ monomers, A$\beta_{16-22}$ oligomer
formation, and protofilament formation in a Sup35 peptide. Simulations show
that the formation of aggregation-prone structures (N$^*$) similar to the
structure in the fibril requires overcoming high desolvation barrier. The
mechanism of protofilament formation in a polar Sup35 peptide fragment
illustrates that water dramatically slows down self-assembly. Release of water
trapped in the pores as water wires creates protofilament with a dry interface.
Similarly, one of the main driving force for addition of a solvated monomer to
a preformed fibril is the entropy gain of released water.
  We conclude by postulating that two-step model for protein crystallization
must also hold for higher order amyloid structure formation starting from
N$^*$. Multiple N$^*$ structures with varying water content results in a number
of distinct water-laden polymorphic structures. In predominantly hydrophobic
sequences, water accelerates fibril formation. In contrast, water-stabilized
metastable intermediates dramatically slow down fibril growth rates in
hydrophilic sequences.

decentralized feedback policies for opportunistic beamforming under finite
feedback constraints on the average number of mobile users feeding back.
Firstly, it is shown that any sum-rate maximizing selective decentralized
feedback policy must be a threshold feedback policy. This result holds for all
fading channel models with continuous distribution functions. Secondly, the
resulting optimum threshold selection problem is analyzed in detail. This is a
non-convex optimization problem over finite dimensional Euclidean spaces. By
utilizing the theory of majorization, an underlying Schur-concave structure in
the sum-rate function is identified, and the sufficient conditions for the
optimality of homogenous threshold feedback policies are obtained. Applications
of these results are illustrated for well known fading channel models such as
Rayleigh, Nakagami and Rician fading channels, along with various engineering
and design insights. Rather surprisingly, it is shown that using the same
threshold value at all mobile users is not always a rate-wise optimal feedback
strategy, even for a network with identical mobile users experiencing
statistically the same channel conditions. For the Rayleigh fading channel
model, on the other hand, homogenous threshold feedback policies are proven to
be rate-wise optimal if multiple orthonormal data carrying beams are used to
communicate with multiple mobile users simultaneously.

signal-to-noise ratio for each pixel, we derive several quantities describing
the pixel color-magnitude diagram (pCMD) of NGC 5194: blue/red color cut, red
pixel sequence parameters, blue pixel sequence parameters and blue-to-red pixel
ratio. The red sequence pixels are mostly older than 1 Gyr, while the blue
sequence pixels are mostly younger than 1 Gyr, in their luminosity-weighted
mean stellar ages. The color variation in the red pixel sequence from V = 20
mag arcsec^(-2) to V = 17 mag arcsec^(-2) corresponds to a metallicity
variation of \Delta[Fe/H] ~ 2 or an optical depth variation of \Delta\tau_V ~ 4
by dust, but the actual sequence is thought to originate from the combination
of those two effects. At V < 20 mag arcsec^(-2), the color variation in the
blue pixel sequence corresponds to an age variation from 5 Myr to 300 Myr under
the assumption of solar metallicity and \tau_V = 1. To investigate the spatial
distributions of stellar populations, we divide pixel stellar populations using
the pixel color-color diagram and population synthesis models. As a result, we
find that the pixel population distributions across the spiral arms agree with
a compressing process by spiral density waves: dense dust \rightarrow
newly-formed stars. The tidal interaction between NGC 5194 and NGC 5195 appears
to enhance the star formation at the tidal bridge connecting the two galaxies.
We find that the pixels corresponding to the central active galactic nucleus

which are in the region of R ~ 100 pc and may be a photometric indicator of AGN

produced by the collision of a magnetized anisotropic pulsar wind with its
environment in binary system. We compare the impact of both the magnetic field
and the wind anisotropy to the benchmark case of a purely hydrodynamical (HD)
interaction of isotropic winds, which has been studied in detail by Bogovalov
et al. (2008). We consider the interaction in axisymmetric approximation, i.e.
the pulsar rotation axis is assumed to be oriented along the line between the
pulsar and the optical star and the effects related to the pulsar orbiting are
neglected. The impact of the magnetic field is studied for the case of weak
magnetization (with magnetization parameter $\sigma<0.1$), which is consistent
with conventional models of pulsar winds. The effects related to anisotropy in
pulsar winds are modeled assuming that the kinetic energy flux in a
non-magnetized pulsar wind is strongly anisotropic, with the minimum at the
pulsar rotation axis and the maximum in the perpendicular direction. We show
that, although both considered effects change the shape of the region occupied
by the terminated pulsar wind, their impact appears to be small. In particular,
for the magnetization of the pulsar wind below 0.1, the magnetic field pressure
remains well below the plasma pressure in the post-shock region. Thus, in the
case of interaction of a pulsar with the stellar wind environment (opposite to
the case of plerions, i.e. the pulsar interaction with the interstellar medium,
when the magnetic field becomes dynamically important independently on the wind
magnetization) the HD approach represents a feasible approximation for
numerical modelling.

two effects both linked to the circumstellar disk (CD), is a key element in the
proposed model. The first effect is related to the impact of the surrounding
medium on the termination of the pulsar wind. Inside the disk, the ""early""
termination of the wind results in suppression of its gamma-ray luminosity.
When the pulsar escapes the disk, the conditions for termination of the wind
undergo significant changes. This would lead to a dramatic increase of the
pulsar wind zone, and thus to the proportional increase of the gamma-ray flux.
On the other hand, if the parts of the CD disturbed by the pulsar can supply
infrared photons of density high enough for efficient Comptonization of the
wind, almost the entire kinetic energy of the pulsar wind would be converted to
radiation, thus the gamma-ray luminosity of the wind could approach to the
level of the pulsar's spin-down luminosity as reported by the {\it Fermi}
collaboration.

in humans, scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or 'mad-cow'

there have not been some effective therapeutic approaches to treat all these
prion diseases. Dogs, rabbits and horses were reported to be resistant to prion
diseases. By the end of year 2010 all the NMR structures of dog, rabbit and
horse prion proteins (X-ray for rabbits too) had been finished to release into
protein data bank. Thus, at this moment it is very worth studying the NMR and
X-ray molecular structures of horse, dog and rabbit prion proteins to obtain
insights into their immunity prion diseases.
  The author found that dog and horse prion proteins have stable molecular
dynamical structures whether under neutral or low pH environments, but rabbit
prion protein has stable molecular dynamical structures only under neutral pH
environment. Under low pH environment, the stable $\alpha$-helical molecular
structures of rabbit prion protein collapse into $\beta$-sheet structures. This
article focuses the studies on rabbit prion protein (within its C-terminal NMR,
Homology and X-ray molecular structured region RaPrP$^\text{C}$ (120-230)),
compared with human and mouse prion proteins (HuPrP$^\text{C}$ (125-228) and
MoPrP$^\text{C}$ (124-226) respectively). The author finds that some salt
bridges contribute to the structural stability of rabbit prion protein under

develop a semiparametric Bayesian model that provides an accurate fit to the

impartial in that the model used for generating data is not used by any of the

model that fits data. Our results quantify the conservative control of the
false discovery rate with the Benjamini and Hockberg method compared to the
empirical Bayes approach and the multiple testing method proposed in Storey [J.

in nature. Safety researchers typically use observational data to answer such
questions, but often without appropriate causal inference methodology. The
field of causal inference presents several modeling frameworks for probing
empirical data to assess causal relations. This paper focuses on exploring the
applicability of two such modeling frameworks---Causal Diagrams and Potential
Outcomes---for a specific transportation safety problem. The causal effects of
pavement marking retroreflectivity on safety of a road segment were estimated.
More specifically, the results based on three different implementations of
these frameworks on a real data set were compared: Inverse Propensity Score
Weighting with regression adjustment and Propensity Score Matching with
regression adjustment versus Causal Bayesian Network. The effect of increased
pavement marking retroreflectivity was generally found to reduce the
probability of target nighttime crashes. However, we found that the magnitude
of the causal effects estimated are sensitive to the method used and to the
assumptions being violated.

gravitationally bound, is defined by co-moving members. DD UMa is a $\delta$
Scuti star whose membership in the Ursa Major group is unclear.
  The objective of this study is to confirm the membership of DD UMa in the
Ursa Major group, as well as perform a detailed spectral analysis of the star.
Since DD UMa is a low-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti star, we performed a frequency
analysis. We determined fundamental parameters, chemical abundances, and derive
a mass and age for the star.
  For this study we observed DD UMa at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory
with the high-resolution spectrograph HIDES, between the $27^{th}$ of February
and the $4^{th}$ March, 2009. Additional observations were extracted from the
ELODIE archive in order to expand our abundance analysis. Group membership of
DD UMa was assessed by examining the velocity of the star in Galactic
coordinates. Pulsational frequencies were determined by examining line profile
variability in the HIDES spectra. Stellar fundamental parameters and chemical
abundances were derived by fitting synthetic spectra to both the HIDES and
ELODIE observations.
  DD UMa is found to be a member of the extended stream of the Ursa Major
group, based on the space motion of the star. This is supported by the chemical
abundances of the star being consistent with those of Ursa Major group members.
The star is found to be chemically solar, with $T_{eff}=7450\pm150$ K and $\log
g=3.98\pm0.2$. We found pulsational frequencies of 9.4 c/d and 15.0 c/d. While
these frequencies are insufficient to perform an asteroseismic study, DD UMa is
a good bright star candidate for future study by the BRITE-constellation.

consistent and thorough re-analyses of both pre-launch and in-orbit data have
been performed. With laboratory experiments using spare hardware, the pulse
height offset, corresponding to zero energy input, was found to change by ~0.5
of the full analog voltage scale, depending on the power supply. Furthermore,
by carefully calculating all the light outputs of secondaries from activation
lines used in the in-orbit gain determination, their energy deposits in GSO
were found to be effectively lower, by several percent, than their nominal
energies. Taking both these effects into account, the in-orbit data agrees with
the on-ground measurements within ~5%, without employing the artificial
correction introduced in the previous work (Kokubun et al. 2007). With this

active planet host star HD189733 with high-precision optical photometry by the
MOST satellite and high-resolution spectra by SOPHIE. We apply on this unique
dataset a spot model to predict the activity-induced RV variations and compare
them with the observed ones. The model is based on the rotational modulation of
the stellar flux. A maximum entropy regularization is applied to find a unique
and stable solution for the distribution of the active regions versus stellar
longitude. The RV variations are synthesized considering the effects on the
line profiles of the brightness perturbations due to dark spots and bright
faculae and the reduction of the convective blueshifts in the active regions.
The synthesized RV time series shows a remarkably good agreement with the
observed one although variations on timescales shorter than 4-5 days cannot be
reproduced by our model. Persistent active longitudes are revealed by the spot
modelling. They rotate with slightly different periods yielding a minimum
relative amplitude of the differential rotation of \Delta \Omega / \Omega =
0.23 \pm 0.10. The method proves capable of reducing the power of the
activity-induced RV variations by a factor from 2 to 10 at the rotation
frequency and its harmonics up to the third. Thanks to the high-precision
space-borne photometry delivered by CoRoT, Kepler, or later PLATO, it is
possible to map the longitudinal distribution of active regions in late-type
stars and apply the method presented in this paper to reduce remarkably the
impact of stellar activity on their RV jitter allowing us to confirm the
detection of low-mass planets or refine the measurement of their mass.

the 24-hour dietary recall, yet the measure of most interest is usual or
long-term average daily intake, which is impossible to measure. Thus, usual
dietary intake is assessed with considerable measurement error. Also, diet
represents numerous foods, nutrients and other components, each of which have
distinctive attributes. Sometimes, it is useful to examine intake of these
components separately, but increasingly nutritionists are interested in
exploring them collectively to capture overall dietary patterns. Consumption of
these components varies widely: some are consumed daily by almost everyone on
every day, while others are episodically consumed so that 24-hour recall data
are zero-inflated. In addition, they are often correlated with each other.
Finally, it is often preferable to analyze the amount of a dietary component
relative to the amount of energy (calories) in a diet because dietary
recommendations often vary with energy level. The quest to understand overall
dietary patterns of usual intake has to this point reached a standstill. There
are no statistical methods or models available to model such complex
multivariate data with its measurement error and zero inflation. This paper
proposes the first such model, and it proposes the first workable solution to
fit such a model. After describing the model, we use survey-weighted MCMC
computations to fit the model, with uncertainty estimation coming from balanced

events, the data collected from a WSN are almost always incomplete if the
surveyed physical event spreads over a wide area. The reason for this
incompleteness is twofold: i) insufficient network coverage and ii) data
aggregation for energy saving. Whereas the existing recovery schemes only
tackle the second aspect, we develop Dual-lEvel Compressed Aggregation (DECA)
as a novel framework to address both aspects. Specifically, DECA allows a high
fidelity recovery of a widespread event, under the situations that the WSN only
sparsely covers the event area and that an in-network data aggregation is
applied for traffic reduction. Exploiting both the low-rank nature of
real-world events and the redundancy in sensory data, DECA combines matrix
completion with a fine-tuned compressed sensing technique to conduct a
dual-level reconstruction process. We demonstrate that DECA can recover a
widespread event with less than 5% of the data, with respect to the dimension
of the event, being collected. Performance evaluation based on both synthetic

substrates. The MOS devices have been subjected to constant voltage stress
(CVS) conditions at accumulation and show relaxation effects in the whole range
of applied stress voltages. Applied voltage polarities as well as thickness
dependence of the relaxation effects have been investigated. Charge trapping is
negligible at low stress fields while at higher fields (>4MV/cm) it becomes
significant. In addition, we give experimental evidence that in tandem with the
dielectric relaxation effect another mechanism- the so-called Maxwell-Wagner
instability- is present and affects the transient current during the
application of a CVS pulse. This instability is also found to be field
dependent thus resulting in a trapped charge which is negative at low stress
fields but changes to positive at higher fields.

determine the final structure of a planetary system emerging from such a disc.
We concentrate our attention on the dynamical interactions between disc and
planets leading to orbital migration, which in turn, in favourable
circumstances, can drive planets into a mean-motion commensurability. We find
that for a system containing a gas giant on the external orbit and a
Super-Earth on the internal one, both embedded in a gaseous disc, the 2:1
resonance is a very likely configuration, so one can expect it as an outcome of
the early phases of the planetary system formation. Our conclusion is based on
an extensive computational survey in which we ask what are the disc properties
(the surface density and the viscosity) for which the 2:1 commensurability may
be attained. To answer this question we employ a full two-dimensional
hydrodynamic treatment of the disc-planet interactions. In general terms, we
can claim that the conditions which favour the 2:1 mean-motion resonance exist
in the protoplanetary discs with mass accretion rates typical for slowly
accreting T Tauri stars. For accretion rates higher than those needed for the
2:1 commensurability we observe a variety of behaviours, among them the passage
to the 3:2 resonance, the scattering of the Super-Earth or the divergent
migration caused by the outward migration of the gas giant. The results we have
obtained from numerical simulations are compared with the predictions coming
from the existing analytical expressions of the migration speed and the
strength of the mean motion resonances. The conditions that we have found for
the attainment of the 2:1 commensurability are discussed in the framework of

expected (the so-called \emph{Moon shadow}). The Moon shadow is an important
tool to determine the performance of an air shower array. Indeed, the westward
displacement of the shadow center, due to the bending effect of the geomagnetic
field on the propagation of cosmic rays, allows the setting of the absolute
rigidity scale of the primary particles inducing the showers recorded by the
detector. In addition, the shape of the shadow permits to determine the
detector point spread function, while the position of the deficit at high
energies allows the evaluation of its absolute pointing accuracy.
  In this paper we present the observation of the cosmic ray Moon shadowing
effect carried out by the ARGO-YBJ experiment in the multi-TeV energy region
with high statistical significance (55 standard deviations). By means of an
accurate Monte Carlo simulation of the cosmic rays propagation in the
Earth-Moon system, we have studied separately the effect of the geomagnetic
field and of the detector point spread function on the observed shadow. The
angular resolution as a function of the particle multiplicity and the pointing
accuracy have been obtained. The primary energy of detected showers has been
estimated by measuring the westward displacement as a function of the particle
multiplicity, thus calibrating the relation between shower size and cosmic ray
energy. The stability of the detector on a monthly basis has been checked by
monitoring the position and the deficit of the Moon shadow. Finally, we have
studied with high statistical accuracy the shadowing effect in the

radioactivity gamma-rays have recently been investigated, such as Sco-Cen and
Orion. As for 44Ti, spectroscopical information constrains ejection velocities
of these inner supernova ejecta for the Cas A event. These parameters for
massive stars can be related to other fields of astronomy, of nuclear physics
experiments and theory, and of theoretical astrophysics. Thus, model
improvements appear on the horizon, as e.g. implemented in the EuroGenesis
program framework of the European Science Foundation.

hardness, by defining a local hardness concept through the derivative of the
chemical potential with respect to the electron density, has been found to have
limited chemical applicability, and has proved to be an unfeasible approach in
principle. Here, we propose a new approach via a unique local energy concept.
This local energy is shown to emerge from the Hamilton-Jacobi kind of
construction of Schrodinger's quantum mechanics. It then leads to the concepts
of a local chemical potential, i.e. negative of local electronegativity, and a
local hardness just as the chemical potential and hardness are obtained from
the energy, namely via differentiations with respect to the number of
electrons. The emerging local hardness adds corrections to a recently proposed
local hardness expression that has been found to be a good local measure of
hardness for a series of atomic and molecular systems. These corrections become
relevant for molecules with a large number of electrons. It is pointed out
further that the definition of local softness that yields it as the Fukui
function times the softness is not well-established, explaining recent
observations of failure of this local softness concept as a proper local
reactivity index for hard systems.

to the case of (Ga,Fe)N layers obtained without any codoping by shallow

transmission electron microscopy and by high-resolution- and synchrotron x-ray
diffraction gives evidence of the fact that in the case of homogenous-Mg
doping, Mg and Fe competitively occupy the Ga-substitutional cation sites,
reducing the efficiency of Fe incorporation. Accordingly, the character of the
magnetization is modified from ferromagnetic-like in the non-codoped films to
paramagnetic in the case of homogeneous Mg codoping. The findings are discussed
vis-`a-vis theoretical results obtained by ab initio computations, showing only
a weak effect of codoping on the pairing energy of two Fe cations in bulk GaN.
However, according to these computations, codoping reverses the sign of the
paring energy of Fe cations at the Ga-rich surface, substantiating the view
that the Fe aggregation occurs at the growth surface. In contrast to the
homogenous deposition mode, the digital one is found to remarkably promote the
aggregation of the magnetic ions. The Fe-rich nanocrystals formed in this way
are distributed non-uniformly, giving reason for the observed deviation from a
standard superparamagnetic behavior.

relying on the radiation pressure force on a nanomechanical resonator, we
provide an experimental demonstration and an analytical description of how the

amplification. This scheme, based on two linear oscillators, has the advantage
of being conceptually and practically simpler than the Josephson junction
devices, and, at the same time, has a high potential to reach quantum limited

be attributed to massless fermions. In our endeavour to build a pilot-wave
theory of massless fermions, which would be relevant for the study of quantum
non-equilibrium in the early universe, we are naturally led to Weyl spinors and
to particle trajectories which give meaning to the `zig-zag' picture of the
electron discussed recently by Penrose. We show that a positive-energy massive
Dirac electron of given helicity can be thought of as a superposition of
positive and negative energy Weyl particles of the same helicity and that a
single massive Dirac electron can in principle move luminally at all times.
This is however not true for the many body situation required by quantum field
theory and we conclude that a more natural theory arises from attributing

stripe patterns in two generalizations of the two-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg
equation that include coupling to a mean flow. A projection operator is
included in our models to allow exact stripe solutions. In the generalized
models, stripes become unstable to the skew-varicose, oscillatory skew-varicose
and cross-roll instabilities, in addition to the usual Eckhaus and zigzag
instabilities. We analytically derive stability boundaries for the
skew-varicose instability in various cases, including several asymptotic
limits. We also use numerical techniques to determine eigenvalues and hence
stability boundaries of other instabilities. We extend our analysis to both
stress-free and no-slip boundary conditions and we note a cross over from the
behaviour characteristic of no-slip to that of stress-free boundaries as the
coupling to the mean flow increases or as the Prandtl number decreases.
  Close to the critical value of the bifurcation parameter, the skew varicose
instability has the same curvature as the Eckhaus instability provided the
coupling to the mean flow is greater than a critical value. The region of
stable stripes is completely eliminated by the cross-roll instability for large
coupling to the mean flow.

are studied. To analysis the fluid flow complexity in fracture networks with
respect to the variation of connectivity patterns, two different approaches are
employed, namely, the Lattice Boltzmann method and graph theory. The Lattice
Boltzmann method is used to show the sensitivity of the permeability and fluid
velocity distribution to synthetic fracture networks' connectivity patterns.
Furthermore, the fracture networks are mapped into the graphs, and the
characteristics of these graphs are compared to the main spatial fracture
networks. Among different characteristics of networks, we distinguish the
modularity of networks and sub-graphs distributions. We map the flow regimes
into the proper regions of the network's modularity space. Also, for each type
of fluid regime, corresponding motifs shapes are scaled. Implemented power law
distributions of fracture length in spatial fracture networks yielded the same
node's degree distribution in transformed networks. Two general spatial
networks are considered: random networks and networks with ""hubness"" properties
mimicking a spatial damage zone (both with power law distribution of fracture
length). In the first case, the fractures are embedded in uniformly distributed
fracture sets; the second case covers spatial fracture zones. We prove
numerically that the abnormal change (transition) in permeability is controlled
by the hub growth rate. Also, comparing LBM results with the characteristic
mean length of transformed networks' links shows a reverse relationship between
the aforementioned parameters. In addition, the abnormalities in advection
through nodes are presented.

combines integer-valued time series models with a dynamic latent factor
structure. Covariate information is captured via simple constraints on the
factor loadings. We directly model the count-valued arrivals per hour, rather
than using an artificial assumption of normality. This is crucial for the
emergency medical service context, in which the volume of calls may be very
low. Smoothing splines are used in estimating the factor levels and loadings to
improve long-term forecasts. We impose time series structure at the hourly
level, rather than at the daily level, capturing the fine-scale dependence in
addition to the long-term structure. Our analysis considers all emergency
priority calls received by Toronto EMS between January 2007 and December 2008
for which an ambulance was dispatched. Empirical results demonstrate
significantly reduced error in forecasting call arrival volume. To quantify the
impact of reduced forecast errors, we design a queueing model simulation that
approximates the dynamics of an ambulance system. The results show better
performance as the forecasting method improves. This notion of quantifying the
operational impact of improved statistical procedures may be of independent
interest.

decision analysis and for applications involving preference queries. For
example, in a typical online retail application, skyline queries can help
customers select the most interesting, among a pool of available, products.
Recently, reverse skyline queries have been proposed, highlighting the
manufacturer's perspective, i.e. how to determine the expected buyers of a
given product. In this work we develop novel algorithms for two important
classes of queries involving customer preferences. We first propose a novel
algorithm, termed as RSA, for answering reverse skyline queries. We then
introduce a new type of queries, namely the k-Most Attractive Candidates k-MAC
query. In this type of queries, given a set of existing product specifications
P, a set of customer preferences C and a set of new candidate products Q, the
k-MAC query returns the set of k candidate products from Q that jointly
maximizes the total number of expected buyers, measured as the cardinality of
the union of individual reverse skyline sets (i.e., influence sets). Applying
existing approaches to solve this problem would require calculating the reverse
skyline set for each candidate, which is prohibitively expensive for large data
sets. We, thus, propose a batched algorithm for this problem and compare its
performance against a branch-and-bound variant that we devise. Both of these
algorithms use in their core variants of our RSA algorithm. Our experimental
study using both synthetic and real data sets demonstrates that our proposed
algorithms outperform existing, or naive solutions to our studied classes of
queries.

can be applied, since we need to compare two symplectic forms in a neighborhood
of the ground states not in in energy space, but rather in a smaller space
where also the variance is bounded. Then the validity of Darboux Theorem is not

some resemblance to the FFLO pairing. It is of great interest to extend these
studies to fermionic atoms with higher spin, e.g., for neutral $^{40}$K,
$^{43}$Ca, $^{87}$Sr or $^{173}$Yb atoms. Within the grand-canonical ensemble
we investigated the $\mu$ vs. $H$ phase diagram for $S=3/2$ ($\mu$ is the
chemical potential and $H$ the external magnetic field) for the ground state
using the exact Bethe {\it ansatz} solution of the one-dimensional Fermi gas
interacting with an attractive $\delta$-function potential. There are four
fundamental states: The particles can be either unpaired or clustered in bound
states of two, three and four fermions. The rich phase diagram consists of
these four states and various mixed phases in which combinations of the
fundamental states coexist. Bound states of four fermions are not favorable in
high magnetic fields, but always present if the field is low. Working within
the grand-canonical ensemble has the following advantages: (1) A universal
phase diagram is obtained by scaling with respect to the interaction strength
and (2) possible scenarios for phase separation are explored within the local
density approximation. The phase diagram for the superposition of a Zeeman and
a quadrupolar splitting is also discussed.

derived, we have estimated the compactness (v^2/r) up to the turnover radius,
which is where the nuclear rings reside. We find that there is evidence of a
correlation between compactness and ring width and size. Radially wide rings
are less compact, and thus have lower mass concentration. The compactness
increases as the ring width decreases. We also find that the nuclear ring size
is dependent on the bar strength, with weaker bars allowing rings of any size

spectra taken with STIS were acquired from the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) and

The profile of a single D-line consists of double-peaked emission, red-shifted
absorption and blue-shifted absorption. We find that the double-peaked emission
originates from the bipolar outflow, the red-shifted absorption feature is due
to the photospheric line, and the blue-shifted absorption arises from the
bipolar outflow as seen against the photosphere of the luminous post-AGB
component in HD 44179. In order to better understand the Na I D-line profile,
we examined the periodically variable asymmetric photospheric absorption lines.
The asymmetric lines are interpreted as a signature of slow self-accretion
following enhanced mass-loss around periastron. An empirical model was
constructed to remove the photospheric component from the Na I D-line profile

atto- to femtolitres. Physiological concentrations realized in such small
volumes imply low copy numbers of interacting molecules with the consequence of
considerable fluctuations in the concentrations. In contrast, rate equation
models are based on the implicit assumption of infinitely large numbers of
interacting molecules, or equivalently, that reactions occur in infinite
volumes at constant macroscopic concentrations. In this article we compute the
finite-volume corrections (or equivalently the finite copy number corrections)
to the solutions of the rate equations for chemical reaction networks composed
of arbitrarily large numbers of enzyme-catalyzed reactions which are confined
inside a small sub-cellular compartment. This is achieved by applying a
mesoscopic version of the quasi-steady state assumption to the exact
Fokker-Planck equation associated with the Poisson Representation of the
chemical master equation. The procedure yields impressively simple and compact
expressions for the finite-volume corrections. We prove that the predictions of
the rate equations will always underestimate the actual steady-state substrate
concentrations for an enzyme-reaction network confined in a small volume. In
particular we show that the finite-volume corrections increase with decreasing
sub-cellular volume, decreasing Michaelis-Menten constants and increasing
enzyme saturation. The magnitude of the corrections depends sensitively on the
topology of the network. The predictions of the theory are shown to be in
excellent agreement with stochastic simulations for two types of networks
typically associated with protein methylation and metabolism.

described by a Fokker-Planck equation without friction on the tangent bundle of

not divergence-free, which makes it inconsistent to couple the Fokker-Planck
equation to the Einstein equations. This problem can be solved by postulating
the existence of additional matter fields in spacetime or by modifying the
Einstein equations. The case of a cosmological scalar field term added to the
left hand side of the Einstein equations is studied in some details. For the
simplest cosmological model, namely the flat Robertson-Walker spacetime, it is
shown that, depending on the initial value of the cosmological scalar field,
which can be identified with the present observed value of the cosmological
constant, either unlimited expansion or the formation of a singularity in
finite time will occur in the future. Future collapse into a singularity also
takes place for a suitable small but positive present value of the cosmological
constant, in contrast to the standard diffusion-free scenario.

characteristics during this observation cover the region where previous
observations have shown the source to be most dynamic. Despite that the source
behavior on time scales of hours and days is remarkably similar to that on year
time scales. This includes a variety of spectral/temporal correlations that
previously had only been observed over Cyg X-1's long-term evolution.
Furthermore, we observe a full transition from a hard to a soft spectral state
that occurs within less than 2.5 hours - shorter than previously reported for
any other similar Cyg X-1 transition. We describe the spectra with a
phenomenological model dominated by a broken power law, and we fit the X-ray
variability power spectra with a combination of a cutoff power law and
Lorentzian components. The spectral and timing properties are correlated: the
power spectrum Lorentzian components have an energy-dependent amplitude, and
their peak frequencies increase with photon spectral index. Averaged over
3.2-10 Hz, the time lag between the variability in the 4.5-5.7 keV and 9.5-15
keV bands increases with decreasing hardness when the variability is dominated
by the Lorentzian components during the hard state. The lag is small when there
is a large power law noise contribution, shortly after the transition to the
soft state. Interestingly, the soft state not only shows the shortest lags, but
also the longest lags when the spectrum is at its softest and faintest. We
discuss our results in terms of emission models for black hole binaries.

significant drag reduction (up to 22%) has been obtained over a broad range of

radio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. The latter
quantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range of
spectral energy distribution (SED) parameters in the bright blazar population.
The BL Lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasing
gamma-ray loudness with synchrotron SED peak frequency, suggesting a universal
SED shape for objects of this class. The synchrotron self-Compton model is
favored for the gamma-ray emission in these BL Lacs over external seed photon
models, since the latter predict a dependence of Compton dominance on Doppler
factor that would destroy any observed synchrotron SED peak - gamma-ray
loudness correlation. The high-synchrotron peaked (HSP) BL Lac objects are
distinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, and
none display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarization
levels. No equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars

relativistic beaming, we suggest that the HSP BL Lacs have generally lower
Doppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked BL Lacs or FSRQs in our

example that the Vainshtein mechanism of nonlinear massive gravity theories

tentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within
1.6-sigma. The intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of H2O(202-111)/CO8-7 seem
comparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-AGN Mrk 231,
suggesting that SDP.17b could also host a luminous AGN. The detection of a
strong H2O 202-111 line in SDP.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism of
the water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

networks with respect to the SINR(Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio)
constraint in metric spaces. The nodes are assigned linear powers, i.e. for
each sender node the power is constant times the path loss between the sender
and corresponding receiver. This is the minimal power for a successful
transmission. We present a constant factor deterministic approximation
algorithm, which works for at least Euclidean fading metrics. Simultaneously we
obtain the approximate value of the optimal schedule length with error at most
a constant factor. To give an insight into the complexity of the problem, we
show that in some metric spaces the problem is NP-hard and cannot be
approximated within a factor less than 1.5.

based on stellar evolution theory, motivated by the recent significant revision
of the rate proposed by nuclear physics calculations. Targeted stellar models
were computed in order to investigate the impact of that rate in the mass range
of 0.8 < M / Msun < 25 and in the metallicity range between Z = 0 and Z = 0.02.
The revised rate has a significant impact on the evolution of low- and
intermediate-mass stars, while its influence on the evolution of massive stars
(M >~ 10 Msun) is minimal. We find that employing the revised rate suppresses
helium shell flashes on AGB phase for stars in the initial mass range 0.8 < M /
Msun < 6, which is contradictory to what is observed. The absence of helium
shell flashes is due to the weak temperature dependence of the revised
triple-alpha reaction cross section at the temperature involved. In our models,
it is suggested that the temperature dependence of the cross section should
have at least nu > 10 at T = 1 - 1.2 x 10^8 K where the cross section is
proportional to T^{nu}. We also derive the helium ignition curve to estimate
the maximum cross section to retain the low-mass first red giants. The
semi-analytically derived ignition curves suggest that the reaction rate should
be less than ~ 10^{-29} cm^6 s^{-1} mole^{-2} at ~ 10^{7.8} K, which
corresponds to about three orders of magnitude larger than that of the NACRE
compilation. In an effort to compromise with the revised rates, we calculate
and analyze models with enhanced CNO cycle reaction rates to increase the
maximum luminosity of the first giant branch. However, it is impossible to
reach the typical RGB tip luminosity even if all the reaction rates related to
CNO cycles are enhanced by more than ten orders of magnitude.

of the WASP lightcurve together with V-band and I_C-band photometry of the
eclipse and a spectroscopic orbit for the A-type star we estimate that the
companion star has a mass of (0.23+-0.03)Msun and a radius of (0.33+-0.01)Rsun,
assuming that the A-type star is a main-sequence star with the metalicity
appropriate for a thick-disk star. The effective temperature of the companion
is (13400+-1200)K from which we infer a luminosity of (3+-1)Lsun. From a
comparison of these parameters to various models we conclude that the companion
is most likely to be the remnant of a red giant star that has been very
recently stripped of its outer layers by mass transfer onto the A-type star. In
this scenario, the companion is currently in a shell hydrogen-burning phase of
its evolution, evolving at nearly constant luminosity to hotter effective
temperatures prior to ceasing hydrogen burning and fading to become a low-mass
white dwarf composed of helium (He-WD). The system will then resemble the
pre-He-WD/He-WD companions to A-type and B-type stars recently identified from
their Kepler satellite lightcurves (KOI-74, KOI-81 and KIC10657664). This newly
discovered binary offers the opportunity to study the evolution of a stripped
red giant star through the pre-He-WD stage in great detail.

to some extra-solar planetary systems, although this number could be relatively
small, it is applied to 55 Cancri, which is a G-type main-sequence star
currently known to host five planets. Following a concise computational
process, we tentatively identify four new hypothetical planetary positions
given as 0.081, 0.41, 1.51 and 2.95 AU from the star. The likelihood that these
positions are occupied by real existing planets is significantly enhanced for
the positions of 1.51 and 2.95 AU in the view of previous simulations on planet
formation and planetary orbital stability. For example, Raymond et al. (2008)
[ApJ 689, 478] argued that additional planets would be possible between 55 Cnc
f and 55 Cnc d, which would include planets situated at 1.51 and 2.95 AU. If
two additional planets are assumed to exist between 55 Cnc f and 55 Cnc d, the
deduced domains of stability would be given as 1.3-1.6 and 2.2-3.3 AU. The
possible planet near 1.5 AU appears to be located at the outskirts of the
stellar habitable zone, which is however notably affected by the stellar
parameters as well as the adopted model of circumstellar habitability. We also
compute the distance of the next possible outer planet in the 55 Cnc system,
which if existing is predicted to be located between 10.9 and 12.2 AU, which is
consistent with orbital stability constraints. The inherent statistical
significance of the TBR is evaluated following the method by Lynch (2003)
[MNRAS 341, 1174]. Yet it is up to future planetary search missions to verify
or falsify the applicability of the TBR to the 55 Cnc system, and to attain
information on additional planets, if existing.
