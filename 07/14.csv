been observed in metals and semiconductors. However, the spin/charge conversion
has not been realized in one of the most fundamental semiconductors, silicon,
where accessing the spin Hall effects has been believed to be difficult because
of its very weak spin-orbit interaction. Here we report observation of the
inverse spin Hall effect in silicon at room temperature. The spin/charge

p-type silicon film. In spite of the small spin Hall angle, we found a clear

characterize the small-scale penumbral magnetic field as well as the vertical
and horizontal component of the Evershed effect (EE).
  The results demonstrate that the penumbral velocity field differs
significantly from that of the quiet Sun. Morphological studies yield elongated
upflow channels in the inner penumbra and round downflows in the outer
penumbra. These flows are identified as the sources and the sinks of the EE.
Remarkable is the high plasma velocity in these sinks, which is much larger
when compared to the quiet Sun. Furthermore, an extraordinary high zenith angle
was found for the penumbral downflows. The small-scale velocity field within
penumbral filaments is investigated both by statistics and case studies. The
outcome of these surveys confirms the predictions of penumbral flux-tube
models. Additionally, bright penumbral downflows as well as two families of
penumbral filaments are studied. Observations of sunspots close to the solar
limb are used to review the horizontal component of the EE.
  Asymmetries of Stokes profiles prove that the penumbral plasma flow is
concentrated in the deep photosphere and that its amplitude diminishes much
faster with height when compared to the quiet Sun. Furthermore, the magnetized
character of the horizontal and the vertical EE is unequivocally confirmed. In
contrast to previous studies, this analysis proves that the sinks of the EE are
filled with a magnetic field of opposite polarity. Finally, the influence of
atmospheric parameters on the asymmetries of Stokes profiles is explored within
the framework of a two-layer model atmosphere and by means of spectral
inversion. Interestingly, it is only the polarity of the gradients with height
of the magnetic field strength that causes the sign of the total net circular
polarization in the center side penumbra.

z=1-3 using one of the largest (166 with M_star>=5e10 M_sun) and most diverse
samples of massive galaxies derived from the GOODS-NICMOS survey: (1) Sersic
fits to deep NIC3/F160W images indicate that the rest-frame optical structures
of massive galaxies are very different at z=2-3 compared to z~0. Approximately
40% of massive galaxies are ultra-compact (r_e<=2 kpc), compared to less than
1% at z~0. Furthermore, most (~65%) systems at z=2-3 have a low Sersic index
n<=2, compared to ~13% at z~0. We present evidence that the n<=2 systems at
z=2-3 likely contain prominent disks, unlike most massive z~0 systems. (2)
There is a correlation between structure and star formation rates (SFR). The
majority (~85%) of non-AGN massive galaxies at z=2-3, with SFR high enough to
yield a 5 sigma (30 micro Jy) 24 micron Spitzer detection have low n<=2. Such
n<=2 systems host the highest SFR. (3) The frequency of AGN is ~40% at z=2-3.
Most (~65%) AGN hosts have disky (n<=2) morphologies. Ultra-compact galaxies
appear quiescent in terms of both AGN activity and star formation. (4) Large
stellar surface densities imply massive galaxies at z=2-3 formed via rapid,
highly dissipative events at z>2. The large fraction of n<=2 disky systems
suggests cold mode accretion complements gas-rich major mergers at z>2. In
order for massive galaxies at z=2-3 to evolve into present-day massive E/S0s,
they need to significantly increase (n, r_e). Dry minor and major mergers may
play an important role in this process.

HACs. We propose that fullerenes are formed from the destruction of HACs,
possibly as a consequence of shocks driven by the fast stellar winds, which can
sometimes be very strong in transition sources and young PNe. This is supported
by the fact that many of our fullerene-detected PNe show altered [NeIII]/[NeII]

powered by their central super massive black holes can be an important source
of magnetic fields in the galaxy clusters. This is paper II in a series of
studies where we present self-consistent high-resolution adaptive mesh
refinement cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that
simultaneously follow the formation of a galaxy cluster and evolution of
magnetic fields ejected by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We studied 12
different galaxy clusters with virial masses ranging from 1 $\times$ 10$^{14}$
to 2 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$. In this work we examine the effects of the
mass and merger history on the final magnetic properties. We find that the
evolution of magnetic fields is qualitatively similar to those of previous
studies. In most clusters, the injected magnetic fields can be transported
throughout the cluster and be further amplified by the intra-cluster medium
(ICM) turbulence during the cluster formation process with hierarchical
mergers, while the amplification history and the magnetic field distribution
depend on the cluster formation and magnetism history. This can be very
different for different clusters. The total magnetic energies in these clusters
are between 4 $\times$ 10$^{57}$ and $10^{61}$ erg, which is mainly decided by
the cluster mass, scaling approximately with the square of the total mass.
Dynamically older relaxed clusters usually have more magnetic fields in their

setups the molecule is connected via linkers to a read-out device, forming a
mechanically coupled dynamic network. Deconvolution of equilibrium
distributions, filtering out the influence of the linkers, is a straightforward
and common practice. We have developed an analogous dynamic deconvolution
theory for the more challenging task of extracting kinetic properties of
individual components in networks of arbitrary complexity and topology. Our
method determines the intrinsic linear response functions of a given molecule
in the network, describing the power spectrum of conformational fluctuations.
The practicality of our approach is demonstrated for the particular case of a
protein linked via DNA handles to two optically trapped beads at constant
stretching force, which we mimic through Brownian dynamics simulations. Each
well in the protein free energy landscape (corresponding to folded, unfolded,
or possibly intermediate states) will have its own characteristic equilibrium
fluctuations. The associated linear response function is rich in physical
content, since it depends both on the shape of the well and its diffusivity---a
measure of the internal friction arising from such processes like the transient
breaking and reformation of bonds in the protein structure. Starting from the
autocorrelation functions of the equilibrium bead fluctuations measured in this
force clamp setup, we show how an experimentalist can accurately extract the
state-dependent protein diffusivity using a straightforward two-step procedure.

Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state has been the subject of intense
study. This state, in which Cooper pairs obtain a nonzero momentum, has
hitherto eluded experimental observation. Recently, we demonstrated that the
FFLO state can be stabilized in a 3D Fermi gas, by adding a 1D periodic
potential. Until now it was assumed that the FFLO wave vector always lies
parallel to this periodic potential (FFLO-P). In this contribution we show
that, surprisingly, the FFLO wave vector can also lie skewed with respect to
the potential (FFLO-S). Starting from the partition sum, the saddle-point free
energy of the system is derived within the path-integral formalism. Minimizing
this free energy allows us to study the different competing ground states of
the system. To qualitatively understand the underlying pairing mechanism, we
visualize the Fermi surfaces of the spin up and spin down particles. From this
visualization, we find that tilting the FFLO wave vector with respect to the
direction of the periodic potential, can result in a larger overlap between the
pairing bands of both spin species. This skewed FFLO state can provide an
additional experimental signature for observing FFLO superfluidity in a 3D
Fermi gas.

proper- ties of equivariant solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model for
ferromagnets. We also analyze both the harmonic map heatflow and Schrodinger
map flow limit cases. All asymptotic results are verified by detailed numerical
experiments, as well as a robust topological argument. The key result of this
paper is that blowup solutions to these problems are co-dimension one and hence
both unstable and non-generic. Solutions permitted to deviate from radial
symmetry remain global for all time but may, for suitable initial data,
approach arbitrarily close to blowup. A careful asymptotic analysis of
solutions near blowup shows that finite-time blowup corresponds to a saddle
fixed point in a low dimensional dynamical system. Radial symmetry precludes
motion anywhere but on the stable manifold towards blowup. A similar scenario
emerges in the equivariant setting: blowup is unstable. To be more precise,
blowup is co-dimension one both within the equivariant symmetry class and in
the unrestricted class of initial data. The value of the parameter in the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation plays a very subdued role in the analysis of
equivariant blowup, leading to identical blowup rates and spatial scales for
all parameter values. One notable exception is the angle between solution in
inner scale (which bubbles off) and outer scale (which remains), which does
depend on parameter values. Analyzing near-blowup solutions, we find that in
the inner scale these solution quickly rotate over an angle {\pi}. As a
consequence, for the blowup solution it is natural to consider a continuation
scenario after blowup where one immediately re-attaches a sphere (thus
restoring the energy lost in blowup), yet rotated over an angle {\pi}. This
continuation is natural since it leads to continuous dependence on initial
data.

studied, the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) crossover physics has remained

the BCS-BEC crossover physics in 2D degenerate Fermi gases in the presence of a
Rashba type of spin-orbit coupling. We derive the mean field gap and atom
number equations suitable for the 2D spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases and solve
them numerically and self-consistently, from which the dependence of the ground
state properties (chemical potential, superfluid pairing gap, ground state
energy per atom) on the system parameters (e.g., binding energy, spin-orbit
coupling strength) is obtained. Furthermore, we derive analytic expressions for
these ground state quantities, which agree well with our numerical results
within a broad parameter region. Such analytic expressions also agree
qualitatively with previous numerical results for the 3D spin-orbit coupled
Fermi gases, where analytic results are lacked. We show that with an increasing
SOC strength, the chemical potential is shifted by a constant determined by the
SOC strength. The superfluid pairing gap is enhanced significantly in the BCS

the coupled channel scattering theory including spin-orbit interaction. We
assume that the coupling between the partial wave components involves orbital
angular momenta such that $\Delta l = 0, \pm 2$. In these conditions, the two
radial functions, components of a partial wave associated to two values of the
angular momentum $l$, satisfy a system of two second-order ordinary
differential equations. We examine the difficulties arising in the analysis of
the behavior of the regular solutions near the origin because of this coupling.
First, we demonstrate that for a singularity of the first kind in the
potential, one of the solutions is not amenable to a power series expansion.
The use of the Lippmann-Schwinger equations confirms this fact: a logarithmic
divergence arises at the second iteration. To overcome this difficulty, we
introduce two auxilliary functions which, together with the two radial
functions, satisfy a system of four first-order differential equations. The
reduction of the order of the differential system enables us to use a
matrix-based approach, which generalizes the standard Frobenius method. We
illustrate our analysis with numerical calculations of coupled scattering wave
functions in a solid-state system.

in offline communication in many ways. Could emotions in Internet exchanges
affect others and systematically influence quantitative and qualitative aspects
of the trajectory of e-communities? The development of automatic sentiment
analysis has made large scale emotion detection and analysis possible using
text messages collected from the web. It is not clear if emotions in
e-communities primarily derive from individual group members' personalities or
if they result from intra-group interactions, and whether they influence group
activities. We show the collective character of affective phenomena on a large
scale as observed in 4 million posts downloaded from Blogs, Digg and BBC
forums. To test whether the emotions of a community member may influence the
emotions of others, posts were grouped into clusters of messages with similar
emotional valences. The frequency of long clusters was much higher than it
would be if emotions occurred at random. Distributions for cluster lengths can
be explained by preferential processes because conditional probabilities for
consecutive messages grow as a power law with cluster length. For BBC forum
threads, average discussion lengths were higher for larger values of absolute
average emotional valence in the first ten comments and the average amount of
emotion in messages fell during discussions. Our results prove that collective

accreting Lya emitter fraction from z~3 to z~7 using a large dark matter
simulation, and a simple physical model that is successful in reproducing many
observations over this large redshift range. The central tenet of this model,
different from many of the earlier models, is that the star-formation in Lya

mass. We find that at z~3, nearly 35% of the Lya emitters accrete their mass
through major (3:1) mergers, and this fraction increases to about 50% at z~7.
This imply that the star-formation in a large fraction of high-redshift Lya
emitters is driven by mergers. While there is discrepancy between the model
predictions and observed merger fractions, some of this difference (~15%) can
be attributed to the mass-ratio used to define a merger in the simulation. We
predict that future, deeper observations which use a 3:1 definition of major

multiply-lensed arcs. The CLASH observations, combined with our mass-model,
allow us to identify 47 new multiply-lensed images of 12 distant sources. These
images, along with the previously known arc, span the redshift range $1\la
z\la5.5$, and thus enable us to derive a detailed mass distribution and to
accurately constrain, for the first time, the inner mass-profile of this
cluster. We find an inner profile slope of $d\log \Sigma/d\log \theta\simeq
-0.55\pm 0.1$ (in the range [1\arcsec, 53\arcsec], or $5\la r \la300$ kpc), as
commonly found for relaxed and well-concentrated clusters. Using the many
systems uncovered here we derive credible critical curves and Einstein radii
for different source redshifts. For a source at $z_{s}\simeq2.5$, the critical
curve encloses a large area with an effective Einstein radius of
$\theta_{E}=28\pm3\arcsec$, and a projected mass of $1.34\pm0.15\times10^{14}
M_{\odot}$. From the current understanding of structure formation in
concordance cosmology, these values are relatively high for clusters at

onto the central black hole. Thus one expects to see dual AGN in a fraction of
galaxy mergers. Candidates for galaxies containing dual AGN have been
identified by the presence of double-peaked narrow [O III] emission lines and
by high spatial resolution images of close galaxy pairs. Spatially-resolved
spectroscopy is needed to confirm these galaxy pairs as systems with
spatially-separated double SMBHs. With the Keck 2 Laser Guide Star Adaptive
Optics system and the OSIRIS near-infrared integral field spectrograph, we
obtained spatially-resolved spectra for SDSS J09527.62+255257.2, a radio-quiet
quasar shown by previous imaging to consist of a galaxy and its close (1.0"")
companion. We find that the main galaxy is a Type 1 AGN with both broad and
narrow AGN emission lines in its spectrum, while the companion galaxy is a Type
2 AGN with narrow emission lines only. The two AGN are separated by 4.8 kpc,
and their redshifts correspond to those of the double peaks of the [O III]
emission line seen in the SDSS spectrum. Line diagnostics indicate that both
components of the double [O III] emission lines are due to AGN photoionization.
These results confirm that J0952+2552 contains two spatially-separated AGN. As
one of the few confirmed dual AGN at an intermediate separation of < 10 kpc,
this system offers a unique opportunity to study galaxy mergers and their

infrared luminosities, L(IR), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (L*)
galaxies at high redshift. Our sample consists of 146 UV-selected galaxies with
spectroscopic redshifts 1.5<z<2.6 in the GOODS-North field. Supplemented with
deep Very Large Array (VLA) and Spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks at
the positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 GHz. The
comparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates and
calibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with UV luminosities
L(UV)>1e10 Lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with a median
L(IR)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 Lsun. Typical galaxies at 1.5<z<2.6 have a median dust
obscuration L(IR)/L(UV) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correction
factor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (SFR) from the
unobscured UV SFR, of 5.2+/-0.6. This result is similar to that inferred from
previous investigations of the UV, H-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and X-ray
properties of the same galaxies studied here. Stacking in bins of UV slope
implies that L* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and that
the correlation between UV slope and dustiness is similar to that found for
local starburst galaxies. Hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxes
validate on average the use of the local UV attenuation curve to recover the
dust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In the
simplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift UV
attenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar and
dust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

CMB power spectrum as observed by WMAP and other microwave experiments. But
Sawangwit & Shanks (2010) have recently shown that the WMAP CMB power spectrum
is highly sensitive to the beam profile of the WMAP telescope. Here, we use the
source catalogue from the Planck Early Data Release to test further the WMAP
beam profiles. We confirm that stacked beam profiles at Q, V and particularly
at W appear wider than expected when compared to the Jupiter beam, normalised
either directly to the radio source profiles or using Planck fluxes. The same
result is also found based on WMAP-CMBfree source catalogues and NVSS sources.
The accuracy of our beam profile measurements is supported by analysis of CMB
sky simulations. However the beam profiles from WMAP7 at the W band are
narrower than previously found in WMAP5 data and the rejection of the WMAP beam
is now only at the ~3sigma level. We also find that the WMAP source fluxes
demonstrate possible non-linearity with Planck fluxes. But including
ground-based and Planck data for the bright Weiland et al (2011) sources may
suggest that the discrepancy is a linear offset rather than a non-linearity.
Additionally, we find that the stacked Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) decrements of
~151 galaxy clusters observed by Planck are in agreement with the WMAP data. We
find that there is no evidence for a WMAP SZ deficit as has previously been
reported. In the particular case of Coma we find evidence for the presence of
an ~0.1mK downwards CMB fluctuation. We conclude that beam profile systematics
can have significant effects on both the amplitude and position of the acoustic
peaks, with potentially important implications for cosmology parameter fitting.

annihilation we estimate the disk mass of about half of short bursts in the

numerical simulations. Massive disks ($\sim {\rm several} 0.1 M_\odot$) found
in some other short GRBs may point to the more efficient magnetic process of
energy extraction or the neutron star and black hole binary progenitor. Our
results suggest that some short bursts may be really due to the coalescence of
double neutron stars and are promising gravitational wave radiation sources.
For future short GRBs with simultaneous gravitational-wave detections, the disk
mass may be reliably inferred and the validity of our approach will be tested.
We also propose a method to constrain the initial radius of a baryonic outflow
where it is launched ($R_0$) without the need of identifying an ideal thermal
spectrum. We then apply it to GRB 090510 and get that $R_0 \lesssim 6.5\times

of the presence of phosphorus. The availability of CRIRES at VLT has permitted
access to this wavelength range in stellar spectra.We attempt to measure the
phosphorus abundance of twenty cool stars in the Galactic disk. The spectra are
analysed with one-dimensional model-atmospheres computed in Local Thermodynamic
Equilibrium (LTE). The line formation computations are performed assuming LTE.
The ratio of phosphorus to iron behaves similarly to sulphur, increasing
towards lower metallicity stars. Its ratio with respect to sulphur is roughly
constant and slightly larger than solar, [P/S]=0.10+- 0.10. We succeed in
taking an important step towards the understanding of the chemical evolution of
phosphorus in the Galaxy. However, the observed rise in the P/Fe abundance
ratio is steeper than predicted by Galactic chemical evolution model model
developed by Kobayashi and collaborators. Phosphorus appears to evolve
differently from the light odd-Z elements sodium and aluminium. The constant
value of [P/S] with metallicity implies that P production is insensitive to the
neutron excess, thus processes other than neutron captures operate. We suggest
that proton captures on 30Si and alpha captures on $27Al are possibilities to
investigate. We see no clear distinction between our results for stars with
planets and stars without any detected planet.

then establishes a reasonable fuel balance and outputs heat fluxes into the

the ignition times in the fire area are calculated based on the distance from
the ignition point to the perimeter, assuming that the perimeter is convex or

continue in a natural way from the perimeter. Possible extensions include
algorithms for more general perimeters and running the fire model backwards in

decoding and linear programming (LP) decoding in MBIOS channels. We present new
certificates that are based on a combinatorial characterization for
local-optimality of a codeword in irregular Tanner codes with respect to any
MBIOS channel. This characterization is based on a conical combination of
normalized weighted subtrees in the computation trees of the Tanner graph.
These subtrees may have any finite height h (even equal or greater than half of
the girth of the Tanner graph). In addition, the degrees of local-code nodes in
these subtrees are not restricted to two. We prove that local optimality in
this new characterization implies maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality and LP
optimality, and show that a certificate can be computed efficiently.
  We also present a new message-passing iterative decoding algorithm, called
normalized weighted min-sum (NWMS). NWMS decoding is a BP-type algorithm that
applies to any irregular binary Tanner code with single parity-check local
codes. We prove that if a locally-optimal codeword with respect to height
parameter h exists (whereby notably h is not limited by the girth of the Tanner
graph), then NWMS decoding finds this codeword in h iterations. The decoding
guarantee of the NWMS decoding algorithm applies whenever there exists a
locally optimal codeword. Because local optimality of a codeword implies that
it is the unique ML codeword, the decoding guarantee also provides an ML
certificate for this codeword.
  Finally, we apply the new local optimality characterization to regular Tanner
codes, and prove lower bounds on the noise thresholds of LP decoding in MBIOS
channels. When the noise is below these lower bounds, the probability that LP

  (2) Electromagnetic induction is the only mechanism of importance for coils

  (3) The terminal voltage at coils and transformers is compensated by the
so-called ""induced voltage"" (emf), which explains why Kirchhoff's voltage law
also applies to coils and transformers.
  (4) The cores of coils and transformers are used for their ability to store
energy. Energy is transported from the primary to the secondary coil within the
magnetic core.
  (5) The stray magnetic and electric fields are sencondary effects not having
a major effect on energy transport.

derived directly from Maxwell's equation for idealised conditions, and
subsequently, the different misconceptions are discussed and corrected.

atmosphere is a crucial ongoing effort. Errors in state estimation for these
often highly nonlinear systems has been the primary focus of recent research,
but as that error has been successfully diminished, the role of model error in
forecast uncertainty has duly increased. The present study is an investigation
of a particular empirical correction procedure that is of special interest
because it considers the model a ""black box"", and therefore can be applied
widely with little modification. The procedure involves the comparison of short
model forecasts with a reference ""truth"" system during a training period in
order to calculate systematic (1) state-independent model bias and (2)
state-dependent error patterns. An estimate of the likelihood of the latter
error component is computed from the current state at every timestep of model
integration. The effectiveness of this technique is explored in two
experiments: (1) a perfect model scenario, in which models have the same
structure and dynamics as the true system, differing only in parameter values;
and (2) a more realistic scenario, in which models are structurally different
(in dynamics, dimension, and parameterization) from the target system. In each
case, the results suggest that the correction procedure is more effective for
reducing error and prolonging forecast usefulness than parameter tuning.
However, the cost of this increase in average forecast accuracy is the creation
of substantial qualitative differences between the dynamics of the corrected
model and the true system. A method to mitigate the structural damage caused by
empirical correction and further increase forecast accuracy is presented.

First, we provide evidence that for more than 80% of the input queries -
independently of their frequency - the two major search engines share only
three or fewer URLs in their search results, leading to an increasing
divergence. In this scenario (divergence), we show that even the most robust
measures based on comparing lists is useless to apply; that is, the small
contribution by too few common items will infer no confidence. Second, to
overcome this problem, we propose the fist content-based measures - i.e.,
direct comparison of the contents from search results; these measures are based
on the Jaccard ratio and distribution similarity measures (CDF measures). We
show that they are orthogonal to each other (i.e., Jaccard and distribution)
and extend the discriminative power w.r.t. list based measures. Our approach
stems from the real need of comparing search-engine results, it is automatic
from the query selection to the final evaluation and it apply to any

  Computing",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A $k$-modal probability distribution over the discrete domain $\{1,...,n\}$
is one whose histogram has at most $k$ ""peaks"" and ""valleys."" Such
distributions are natural generalizations of monotone ($k=0$) and unimodal
($k=1$) probability distributions, which have been intensively studied in
probability theory and statistics.
  In this paper we consider the problem of \emph{learning} (i.e., performing
density estimation of) an unknown $k$-modal distribution with respect to the
$L_1$ distance. The learning algorithm is given access to independent samples
drawn from an unknown $k$-modal distribution $p$, and it must output a
hypothesis distribution $\widehat{p}$ such that with high probability the total
variation distance between $p$ and $\widehat{p}$ is at most $\epsilon.$ Our
main goal is to obtain \emph{computationally efficient} algorithms for this
problem that use (close to) an information-theoretically optimal number of
samples.
  We give an efficient algorithm for this problem that runs in time
$\mathrm{poly}(k,\log(n),1/\epsilon)$. For $k \leq \tilde{O}(\log n)$, the
number of samples used by our algorithm is very close (within an
$\tilde{O}(\log(1/\epsilon))$ factor) to being information-theoretically
optimal. Prior to this work computationally efficient algorithms were known
only for the cases $k=0,1$ \cite{Birge:87b,Birge:97}.
  A novel feature of our approach is that our learning algorithm crucially uses
a new algorithm for \emph{property testing of probability distributions} as a
key subroutine. The learning algorithm uses the property tester to efficiently
decompose the $k$-modal distribution into $k$ (near-)monotone distributions,
which are easier to learn.

Improved sample complexity bound of O~(1/eps^2)",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a basic problem in unsupervised learning: learning an unknown
\emph{Poisson Binomial Distribution}. A Poisson Binomial Distribution (PBD)
over $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ is the distribution of a sum of $n$ independent
Bernoulli random variables which may have arbitrary, potentially non-equal,
expectations. These distributions were first studied by S. Poisson in 1837
\cite{Poisson:37} and are a natural $n$-parameter generalization of the
familiar Binomial Distribution. Surprisingly, prior to our work this basic
learning problem was poorly understood, and known results for it were far from
optimal.
  We essentially settle the complexity of the learning problem for this basic
class of distributions. As our first main result we give a highly efficient
algorithm which learns to $\eps$-accuracy (with respect to the total variation
distance) using $\tilde{O}(1/\eps^3)$ samples \emph{independent of $n$}. The
running time of the algorithm is \emph{quasilinear} in the size of its input
data, i.e., $\tilde{O}(\log(n)/\eps^3)$ bit-operations. (Observe that each draw
from the distribution is a $\log(n)$-bit string.) Our second main result is a
{\em proper} learning algorithm that learns to $\eps$-accuracy using
$\tilde{O}(1/\eps^2)$ samples, and runs in time $(1/\eps)^{\poly (\log
(1/\eps))} \cdot \log n$. This is nearly optimal, since any algorithm {for this
problem} must use $\Omega(1/\eps^2)$ samples. We also give positive and
negative results for some extensions of this learning problem to weighted sums
of independent Bernoulli random variables.

spin-singlet $\Delta_{\text{S}}$ and helical p-wave spin-triplet
$\Delta_{\text{T}}$ enriches a variety of low-temperature behavior of Josephson
current depending on their relative amplitudes. We will show that
characteristic behaviors of the Josephson current for $\Delta_{\text{S}} >
\Delta_{\text{T}}$ are clearly different from those for $\Delta_{\text{S}} <
\Delta_{\text{T}}$. The topologically protected zero-energy surface bound
states are responsible for the clear difference. We conclude that the Josephson
current well reflects character of the topological surface states and the
pairing symmetry of noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

theory. This provides a new and challenging setting for algorithmics and
complexity theory. For any graph-based problem, the rapid evolution of a
(possibly disconnected) graph over time naturally leads to the important
complexity question: is it better to calculate a new solution from scratch or
to adapt the known solution on the prior graph to quickly provide a solution of
guaranteed quality for the changed graph?
  In this paper, we demonstrate that the former is the best approach in some
cases, but that there are cases where the latter is feasible. We prove that,
under certain conditions, hard problems cannot even be approximated in any
reasonable complexity bound --- i.e., even with a large amount of time, having
a solution to a very similar graph does not help in computing a solution to the
current graph. To achieve this, we formalize the idea as a maintenance
algorithm. Using r-Regular Subgraph as the primary example we show that
W[1]-hardness for the parameterized approximation problem implies the
non-existence of a maintenance algorithm for the given approximation ratio.
Conversely we show that Vertex Cover, which is fixed-parameter tractable, has a
2-approximate maintenance algorithm. The implications of NP-hardness and
NPO-hardness are also explored.

co-existence of two components, one non-evolving and AGN-related and one

consistent with the WMAP results. One is the co-annihilation with the stau and
the second is the resonant annihilation via exchange of the Z boson or the
light Higgs scalar. A very interesting feature of SO(10) models with negative
\mu is that they predict relatively light sparticle spectra. Even the heaviest
superpartners may easily have masses below 1.5 TeV in contrast to multi-TeV

data observed on the interval whose length may increase with a sample size.
Although this problem arises in a variety of applications, to the best of our
knowledge, it has been given very little attention by the statistical
community. Our objective is to fill this gap and provide statistical treatment
of Laplace deconvolution problem with noisy discrete data. The main
contribution of the paper is explicit construction of an asymptotically
rate-optimal (in the minimax sense) Laplace deconvolution estimator which is
adaptive to the regularity of the unknown function. We show that the original
Laplace deconvolution problem can be reduced to nonparametric estimation of a
regression function and its derivatives on the interval of growing length T_n.
Whereas the forms of the estimators remain standard, the choices of the
parameters and the minimax convergence rates, which are expressed in terms of
T_n^2/n in this case, are affected by the asymptotic growth of the length of
the interval.
  We derive an adaptive kernel estimator of the function of interest, and
establish its asymptotic minimaxity over a range of Sobolev classes. We
illustrate the theory by examples of construction of explicit expressions of
Laplace deconvolution estimators. A simulation study shows that, in addition to
providing asymptotic optimality as the number of observations turns to
infinity, the proposed estimator demonstrates good performance in finite sample
examples.

torque and the corotation torque in non-magnetic viscous models of

attention as it may slow down, stall, or reverse migration. In laminar viscous
disc models, the long-term evolution of the corotation torque is intimately
related to viscous and thermal diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe
region. This paper examines the properties of the corotation torque in discs
where MHD turbulence develops as a result of the magnetorotational instability,
considering a weak initial toroidal magnetic field. We present results of 3D
MHD simulations carried out with two different codes. Non-ideal MHD effects and
the disc's vertical stratification are neglected, and locally isothermal disc
models are considered. The running time-averaged torque exerted by the disc on
a fixed planet is evaluated in three disc models. We first present results with
an inner disc cavity (planet trap). As in viscous disc models, the planet is
found to experience a positive running time-averaged torque over several
hundred orbits, which highlights the existence of an unsaturated corotation
torque maintained in the long term in MHD turbulent discs. Two disc models with
initial power-law density and temperature profiles are also adopted, in which
the time-averaged torque is found to be in decent agreement with its
counterpart in laminar viscous disc models with similar viscosity at the planet
location. Detailed analysis of the averaged torque density distributions
indicates that the differential Lindblad torque takes very similar values in
MHD turbulent and laminar viscous discs, and there exists an unsaturated
corotation torque in MHD turbulent discs. This analysis also reveals the
existence of an additional corotation torque in weakly magnetized discs.

1 Galaxies (gamma-NLS1s) has confirmed the presence of powerful relativistic
jets in this class of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Although the jet emission
is similar to that of blazars and radio galaxies, gamma-NLS1s have some
striking differences: relatively small masses (10^6-10^8 M_sun), high accretion
rates (0.1-1 times the Eddington limit) and are generally hosted by spiral
galaxies. It is now possible to study a rather unexplored range of mass and
accretion rates of AGN with relativistic jets. Specifically, in this work I
present some results obtained by comparing a sample of blazars and gamma-NLS1s
with another sample of Galactic binaries with relativistic jets (stellar mass
black holes and neutron stars).

techniques based on spectral methods. In particular the amplitude of their

only approximately time-periodic. They are continuously losing their mass
because the scalar field radiates to infinity. Their core and radiative tail is
well approximated by that of time-periodic oscillatons. Moreover the mass loss

responsible for the well known effect which exists already in Newtonian
gravity, the Poynting-Robertson effect. Here the Poynting-Robertson effect is
extended to the case of spinning particles by modifying the
Mathisson-Papapetrou model describing the motion of spinning test particles to
account for the contribution of the radiation force. The resulting equations
are numerically integrated and some typical orbits are shown in comparison with
the spinless case. Furthermore, the interplay between spin and radiation forces

synchronizability than the existing topology-aimed growing strategies in both

degree of new added nodes, which means adding nodes with neither too large nor
too low degree could enhance the synchronizability. Furthermore, some topology
measurements are considered in the resultant networks. The results show that
the degree, node betweenness centrality from SBG strategy are more homogenous
than those from other growing strategies. Our work highlights the importance of
the function-aimed growth of the networks and deepens our understanding of it.

anomalies are visible along isotherms as a function of density, but disappears
along the isochores and isobars as a function of temperature. On the other
hand, the diffusion anomaly may be seen along adiabats as a function of
temperature, density and pressure. It should be noted that it may be no
signature of a particular anomaly along a particular trajectory, but the
anomalous region for that particular anomaly can be defined when all possible
trajectories in the same space are examined (for example, signature of
diffusion anomaly is evident through the crossing of different isochors.
However, there is no signature of diffusion anomaly along a particular
isochor). We also analyze the applicability of the Rosenfeld entropy scaling
relations to this system in the regions with the water-like anomalies. It is
shown that the validity of the Rosenfeld scaling relation for the diffusion

the Z/gamma cross section ratio at high pT, which should be insensitive to

resolved Fe K$\alpha$ line complex into three lines of Fe \emissiontype{I}, Fe

spatial intensity profiles with the resolution of $\sim \timeform{0D.1}$. We
compared the Fe \emissiontype{XXV} K$\alpha$ profile with a stellar mass
distribution (SMD) model made from near infrared observations. The intensity
profile of Fe \emissiontype{XXV} K$\alpha$ is nicely fitted with the SMD model
in the GRXE region, while that in the GCDX region shows $3.8\pm0.3$
$(\timeform{0D.2}<|l|<\timeform{1D.5})$ or $19\pm6$ $(|l|<\timeform{0D.2})$
times excess over the best-fit SMD model in the GRXE region. Thus Fe
\emissiontype{XXV} K$\alpha$ in the GCDX is hardly explained by the same origin
of the GRXE. In the case of point source origin, a new population with the
extremely strong Fe \emissiontype{XXV} K$\alpha$ line is required. An
alternative possibility is that the majority of the GCDX is truly diffuse
optically thin thermal plasma.

  operator semigroup approach",,,,,"math.DS math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rigorous linking of exact stochastic models to mean-field approximations
is studied. Starting from the differential equation point of view the
stochastic model is identified by its Kolmogorov equations, which is a system
of linear ODEs that depends on the state space size ($N$) and can be written as
$\dot u_N=A_N u_N$. Our results rely on the convergence of the transition
matrices $A_N$ to an operator $A$. This convergence also implies that the
solutions $u_N$ converge to the solution $u$ of $\dot u=Au$. The limiting ODE
can be easily used to derive simpler mean-field-type models such that the
moments of the stochastic process will converge uniformly to the solution of
appropriately chosen mean-field equations. A bi-product of this method is the
proof that the rate of convergence is $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$. In addition, it turns
out that the proof holds for cases that are slightly more general than the
usual density dependent one. Moreover, for Markov chains where the transition
rates satisfy some sign conditions, a new approach for proving convergence to
the mean-field limit is proposed. The starting point in this case is the
derivation of a countable system of ordinary differential equations for all the
moments. This is followed by the proof of a perturbation theorem for this
infinite system, which in turn leads to an estimate for the difference between
the moments and the corresponding quantities derived from the solution of the
mean-field ODE.

investigated the nature of IGR J11014-6103 by carrying out a multiwavelength
analysis of the available archival observations performed in the direction of
the source. Methods: We present first the results of the timing and spectral
analysis of all the X-ray observations of IGR J11014-6103 carried out with
ROSAT, ASCA, Einstein, Swift, and XMM-Newton, and then use them to search for
possible counterparts to the source in the optical, infra-red, radio and
gamma-ray domain. Results: Our analysis revealed that IGR J11014-6103 is
comprised of three different X-ray emitting regions: a point-like source, an
extended object and a cometary-like ""tail"" (~4 arcmin). A possible radio
counterpart positionally coincident with the source was also identified.
Conclusions: Based on these results, we suggest that the emission from IGR
J11014-6103 is generated by a pulsar wind nebula produced by a high-velocity
pulsar. IGR J11014-6103 might be the first of these systems detected with
INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI.

of spiking and quiescence --- bursting --- are two dynamic patterns observed in
neuronal activity. In computational models of neuronal systems, the transition
from spiking to bursting often exhibits complex bifurcation structure. One type
of transition involves the torus canard, which was originally observed in a
simple biophysical model of a Purkinje cell. In this article, we expand on that
original result by showing that torus canards arise in a broad array of
well-known computational neuronal models with three different classes of
bursting dynamics: sub-Hopf/fold cycle bursting, circle/fold cycle bursting,
and fold/fold cycle bursting. The essential features that these models share
are multiple time scales leading naturally to decomposition into slow and fast
systems, a saddle-node of periodic orbits in the fast system, and a torus
bifurcation in the full system. We show that the transition from spiking to
bursting in each model system is given by an explosion of torus canards. Based
on these examples, as well as on emerging theory, we propose that torus canards
are a common dynamic phenomenon separating the regimes of spiking and bursting
activity.

realizations of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity; they can thus elucidate

In particular, island systems have been predicted to exhibit zero-temperature
metallic states. Although evidence exists for such metallic states in some 2D
systems, their character is not well understood: the conventional theory of
metals cannot explain them, and their properties are difficult to tune. Here,
we characterize the superconducting transitions in mesoscopic island-array
systems as a function of island thickness and spacing. We observe two
transitions in the progression to superconductivity; both transition
temperatures exhibit unexpectedly strong depression for widely spaced islands.
These depressions are consistent with the system approaching zero-temperature
metallic states. The nature of the transitions and the state between them is
explained using a phenomenological model involving the stabilization of
superconductivity on each island via a weak coupling to and feedback from its

metallicity. After an outline of the problems affecting our knowledge of the Li
content in low-mass stars (M<3Mo), we discuss deep-mixing models for the RGB
stages suitable to account for the observed trends and for the correlated
variations of the carbon isotope ratio; we find that Li destruction in these
phases is limited to masses below about 2.3 Mo. Subsequently, we concentrate on
the final stages of evolution for both O-rich and C-rich AGB stars. Here, the
constraints on extra-mixing phenomena previously derived from heavier nuclei
(from C to Al), coupled to recent updates in stellar structure models
(including both the input physics and the set of reaction rates used), are
suitable to account for the observations of Li abundances below A(Li)= log
e(Li) = 1.5 (and sometimes more). Also their relations with other
nucleosynthesis signatures of AGB phases (like the abundance of F, the C/O and
12C/13C ratios) can be explained. This requires generally moderate efficiencies
(\dot M <= 0.3 - 0.5 x 10^-6 Mo/yr) for non-convective mass transport. At such
rates, slow extra-mixing does not modify remarkably Li abundances in early-AGB
phases; on the other hand, faster mixing encounters a physical limit in
destroying Li, set by the mixing velocity. Beyond this limit, Li starts to be
produced; therefore its destruction on the AGB is modest. Li is then
significantly produced by the third dredge up. We also show that effective
circulation episodes, while not destroying Li, would easily bring the 12C/13C
ratios to equilibrium, contrary to the evidence in most AGB stars, and would
burn F beyond the limits shown by C(N) giants. Hence, we do not confirm the
common idea that efficient extra-mixing drastically reduces the Li content of
C-stars with respect to K-M giants.

lying in the high-mass star-forming region G31.41+0.31. This core is believed
to contain deeply embedded massive stars and presents a velocity gradient that
has been interpreted either as rotation or as expansion, depending on the
authors. Our aim was to shed light on this question and possibly prepare the
ground for higher resolution ALMA observations which could directly detect
circumstellar disks around the embedded massive stars. Observations at
sub-arcsecond resolution were performed with the Submillimeter Array in methyl
cyanide, a typical hot molecular core tracer, and 12CO and 13CO, well known
outflow tracers. We also obtained sensitive continuum maps at 1.3 mm. Our
findings confirm the existence of a sharp velocity gradient across the core,
but cannot confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow perpendicular to it. The
improved angular resolution and sampling of the uv plane allow us to attain
higher quality channel maps of the CH3CN lines with respect to previous studies
and thus significantly improve our knowledge of the structure and kinematics of
the hot molecular core. While no conclusive argument can rule out any of the
two interpretations (rotation or expansion) proposed to explain the velocity
gradient observed in the core, in our opinion the observational evidence
collected so far indicates the rotating toroid as the most likely scenario. The

candidates associated with ongoing outflows (known as extended green objects or
EGOs) identified from the Spitzer GLIMPSE survey. The observations were made
with the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) Mopra 22-m radio
telescope and resulted in the detection of 105 new 95 GHz class I methanol
masers. For 92 of the sources our observations provide the first identification
of a class I maser transition associated with these objects (i.e. they are new
class I methanol maser sources). Our survey proves that there is indeed a high
detection rate (55%) of class I methanol masers towards EGOs. Comparison of the
GLIMPSE point sources associated with EGOs with and without class I methanol
maser detections shows they have similar mid-IR colors, with the majority
meeting the color selection criteria -0.6<[5.8]-[8.0]<1.4 and
0.5<[3.6]-[4.5]<4.0. Investigations of the IRAC and MIPS 24 um colors and the
associated millimeter dust clump properties (mass and density) of the EGOs for
the sub-samples based on which class of methanol masers they are associated
with suggests that the stellar mass range associated with class I methanol
masers extends to lower masses than for class II methanol masers, or
alternatively class I methanol masers may be associated with more than one
evolutionary phase during the formation of a high-mass star.

weight (LSW). Starting from the superfluid phase transition temperature $T_{\rm
c}$, we clarify how the pseudogap structures in these quantities disappear with
increasing the temperature. As in the case of a uniform Fermi gas, LDOS and LSW
give different pseudogap temperatures $T^*$ and $T^{**}$ at which the pseudogap
structures in these quantities completely disappear. Determining $T^*$ and
$T^{**}$ over the entire BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC (Bose-Einstein
condensate) crossover region, we identify the pseudogap regime in the phase
diagram with respect to the temperature and the interaction strength. We also
show that the so-called back-bending peak recently observed in the
photoemission spectra by JILA group may be explained as an effect of pseudogap
phenomenon in the trap center. Since strong pairing fluctuations, spatial
inhomogeneity, and finite temperatures, are important keys in considering real
cold Fermi gases, our results would be useful for clarifying normal state
properties of this strongly interacting Fermi system.
