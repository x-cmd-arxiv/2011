$W_\eps(t,x,k)$ of the wave function corresponding to a discrete wave equation
on a 1-d integer lattice, with a weak multiplicative noise. This model has been
introduced in Basile, Bernardin, and Olla to describe a system of interacting
linear oscillators with a weak noise that conserves locally the kinetic energy
and the momentum. The kinetic limit for the Wigner transform has been shown in
Basile, Olla, and Spohn. In the present paper we prove that in the unpinned
case there exists $\gamma_0>0$ such that for any $\gamma\in(0,\gamma_0]$ the
weak limit of $W_\eps(t/\eps^{3/2\gamma},x/\eps^{\gamma},k)$, as $\eps\ll1$,
satisfies a one dimensional fractional heat equation $\partial_t W(t,x)=-\hat
c(-\partial_x^2)^{3/4}W(t,x)$ with $\hat c>0$. In the pinned case an analogous
result can be claimed for $W_\eps(t/\eps^{2\gamma},x/\eps^{\gamma},k)$ but the

model of random differential geometry, by considering a random, smooth
Riemannian metric on $\mathbb R^d$. We are motivated in our study by the random
geometry of first-passage percolation (FPP), a lattice model which was
developed to model fluid flow through porous media. By adapting techniques from
standard FPP, we prove a shape theorem for our model, which says that large
balls under this metric converge to a deterministic shape under rescaling. As a
consequence, we show that smooth random Riemannian metrics are geodesically
complete with probability one.
  In differential geometry, geodesics are curves which locally minimize length.
They need not do so globally: consider great circles on a sphere. For lattice
models of FPP, there are many open questions related to minimizing geodesics;
similarly, it is interesting from a geometric perspective when geodesics are
globally minimizing. In the present study, we show that for any fixed starting
direction $v$, the geodesic starting from the origin in the direction $v$ is
not minimizing with probability one. This is a new result which uses the
infinitesimal structure of the continuum, and for which there is no equivalent
in discrete lattice models of FPP.

now characterized by good smooth properties with in general a single minimum in
the case where the model is appropriate to the empirical data. We complement
the approach with an additional subordination procedure that slaves two of the
nonlinear parameters to what can be considered to be the most crucial nonlinear
parameter, the critical time $t_c$ defined as the end of the bubble and the
most probably time for a crash to occur. This further decreases the complexity
of the search and provides an intuitive representation of the results of the
calibration. With our proposed methodology, metaheuristic searches are not
longer necessary and one can resort solely to rigorous controlled local search
algorithms, leading to dramatic increase in efficiency. Empirical tests on the

(BHs) and their associated Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback in
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Assuming that BHs are created in the
early stages of galaxy formation, they grow by mergers and accretion of gas at
a Eddington-limited Bondi accretion rate. However this growth is regulated by
AGN feedback which we model using two different modes: a quasar-heating mode
when accretion rates onto the BHs are comparable to the Eddington rate, and a
radio-jet mode at lower accretion rates. In other words, our feedback model
deposits energy as a succession of thermal bursts and jet outflows depending on
the properties of the gas surrounding the BHs. We assess the plausibility of
such a model by comparing our results to observational measurements of the
coevolution of BHs and their host galaxy properties, and check their robustness
with respect to numerical resolution. We show that AGN feedback must be a
crucial physical ingredient for the formation of massive galaxies as it appears
to be the only physical mechanism able to efficiently prevent the accumulation
of and/or expel cold gas out of halos/galaxies and significantly suppress star
formation. Our model predicts that the relationship between BHs and their host
galaxy mass evolves as a function of redshift, because of the vigorous
accretion of cold material in the early Universe that drives Eddington-limited
accretion onto BHs. Quasar activity is also enhanced at high redshift. However,
as structures grow in mass and lose their cold material through star formation
and efficient BH feedback ejection, the AGN activity in the low-redshift
Universe becomes more and more dominated by the radio mode, which powers jets
through the hot circum-galactic medium.

significantly upon the presence of the Se and this effect to be increasing with

thus become negatively charged. As a result, they repeal electrostatically the
adsorbed negatively charged O and OH intermediates, and this way reduce their

of the catalyst surfaces. Since for the Ru case, reduction of the O and OH
binding energies makes ORR energetically favorable, Se modification

The bi-Hamiltonian structures and a Darboux transformation of the NKdV

respectively. The single and double kink wave and bell soliton solutions are
given in an explicit formula through the Darboux transformation. The 1-kink

the form of $sech$, and both forms are very standard. The collisions of

singular interaction is a big difference from the regular KdV equation.

solutions. A direct and unifying scheme is proposed for explicitly building up
quasi-periodic wave solutions of the NKdV equations.

  Gamma-ray Sources",,,"10.1088/0004-637X/750/1/35",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coronal hard X-ray (HXR) and continuum gamma-ray sources associated with the
impulsive phase of solar flares have been the subject of renewed interest in
recent years. They have been interpreted in terms of thin-target, nonthermal
bremsstrahlung emission. This interpretation has led to rather extreme physical
requirements in some cases. For example, in one case, essentially all of the
electrons in the source must be accelerated to nonthermal energies to account
for the coronal HXR source. In other cases, the extremely hard photon spectra
of the coronal continuum gamma-ray emission suggest that the low energy cutoff
of the electron energy distribution lies in the MeV energy range. Here we
consider the role of inverse Compton scattering (ICS) as an alternate emission
mechanism in both the ultra- and mildly relativistic regimes. It is known that
relativistic electrons are produced during powerful flares; these are capable
of up-scattering soft photospheric photons to HXR and gamma-ray energies.
Previously overlooked is the fact that mildly relativistic electrons, generally
produced in much greater numbers in flares of all sizes, can up-scatter EUV/SXR
photons to HXR energies. We also explore ICS on anisotropic electron
distributions and show that the resulting emission can be significantly
enhanced over an isotropic electron distribution for favorable viewing
geometries. We briefly review results from bremsstrahlung emission and
reconsider circumstances under which nonthermal bremsstrahlung or ICS would be
favored. Finally, we consider a selection of coronal HXR and gamma-ray events
and find that in some cases the ICS is a viable alternative emission mechanism.

Clusters (GCs), and notably the ubiquitous Na-O anti-correlation, are generally
interpreted as evidence that GCs comprise several generations of stars. There
is an on-going debate as to the nature of the stars which produce the
inhomogeneous elements, and investigating the behavior of several elements is a
way to shed new light on this problem. Aims. We aim at investigating the Li and
Na content of the GC M 4, that is known to have a well defined Na-O
anti-correlation. Methods. We obtained moderate resolution (R=17 000-18 700)
spectra for 91 main sequence (MS)/sub-giant branch stars of M 4 with the
Giraffe spectrograph at the FLAMES/VLT ESO facility. Using model atmospheres
analysis we measured lithium and sodium abundances. Results. We detect a weak
Li-Na anti-correlation among un-evolved MS stars. One star in the sample, #
37934, shows the remarkably high lithium abundance A(Li)=2.87, compatible with
current estimates of the primordial lithium abundance. Conclusions. The shallow
slope found for the Li-Na anti-correlation suggests that lithium is produced in
parallel to sodium. This evidence, coupled with its sodium-rich nature,
suggests that the high lithium abundance of star # 37934 may originate by
pollution from a previous generations of stars. The recent detection of a
Li-rich dwarf of pollution origin in the globular cluster NGC 6397 may also
point in this direction. Still, no clear cut evidence is available against a
possible preservation of the primordial lithium abundance for star # 37934.

synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model and determine the physical parameters of

two peak frequencies $\nu_{\rm s}$ and $\nu_{\rm c}$ also favors the model. It
is found that the break of the electron spectrum ($\gamma_{\rm b}$) is
different among sources, but magnetic field strength distributes narrowly in
$0.1-0.6 $ G, indicating that the shocks in the jets are significantly
different among sources and the magnetic field may be independent of the
shocks. The ratio of $F_{1 TeV}$ is correlated with the ratio of the
$\gamma_{\rm b}$ in the low and high states, indicating that the relativistic
shocks in the jets may be responsible for the observed flux variations and the
spectral shift. The ratio of the two peak luminosities $L_{\rm c}/L_{\rm s}$ is
anti-correlated with $\nu_{\rm s}$ in the co-moving frame, which is possibly
due to the Klein-Nishina effect. No excess in the GeV band due to the
interaction between the TeV photons and the extragalactic background light is
observed, implying that the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field would
be much larger than $ 10^{-16}$ G. An anti-correlation between jet power and
the mass of the central black hole is observed, i.e., $P_{\rm jet}\propto

suggest that the spin energy extraction may be significant for powering jets in

ten years allows us to study its detailed jet kinematics. We identified the
compact component located at the southern-end of the jet as the VLBI core,
consistent with previous studies. The 10-d monitoring data at the 3 high
frequencies were shown to produce high quality and self-consistent measurements
of the component positions, from which we detected for the first time a
two-dimensional frequency-dependent position shift. In addition, the repeated
measurements also permit us to investigate the interday flux density and
structure variability of NRAO 530. We find that it is more variable for the
inner jet components than those further out. We obtained apparent velocities
for eight jet components with $\beta_{\rm app} ranging from 2 to 26 c.
Accordingly, we estimated physical jet parameters with the minimum Lorentz
factor of 14 and Doppler factors in the range of 14--28 (component f). The
changes in the morphology of NRAO 530 were related to the motion of separate
jet components with the most pronounced changes occurring in the regions close
to the core. For NRAO 530, we estimated a P.A. swing of $3^{\circ}.4$ per year
for the entire inner jet (components d and e). The non-ballistic motion and
change of jet orientation makes this source another prominent example of a
helical and possibly `swinging' jet.

approaches for realizing next-generation spintronic devices with ultra low

and NiFe have so far been utilized as a spin injector for generating the pure
spin currents in nonmagnetic channels. However, the generation efficiency of
the pure spin currents is extremely low at room temperature, giving rise to a
serious obstacle for device applications. Here, we demonstrate the generation
of giant pure spin currents at room temperature in lateral spin valve devices
with a highly ordered Heusler-compound Co$_2$FeSi spin injector. The generation
efficiency of the pure spin currents for the Co$_2$FeSi spin injectors reaches
approximately one hundred times as large as that for NiFe ones, indicating that
Heusler-compound spin injectors enable us to materialize a high-performance
lateral spin device. The present study is a technological jump in spintronics
and indicates the great potential of ferromagnetic Heusler compounds with half

filtering theory. The optimal $H_{\infty}$ filter is derived by minimizing the
supremum (or maximum) of a predefined cost function, a criterion different from
the minimum variance used in the Kalman filter. By design, the $H_{\infty}$
filter is more robust than the Kalman filter, in the sense that the estimation
error in the $H_{\infty}$ filter in general has a finite growth rate with
respect to the uncertainties in assimilation, except for a special case that
corresponds to the Kalman filter.
  The original form of the $H_{\infty}$ filter contains global constraints in
time, which may be inconvenient for sequential data assimilation problems.
Therefore we introduce a variant that solves some time-local constraints
instead, and hence we call it the time-local $H_{\infty}$ filter (TLHF). By
analogy to the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), we also propose the concept of
ensemble time-local $H_{\infty}$ filter (EnTLHF). We outline the general form
of the EnTLHF, and discuss some of its special cases. In particular, we show
that an EnKF with certain covariance inflation is essentially an EnTLHF. In
this sense, the EnTLHF provides a general framework for conducting covariance
inflation in the EnKF-based methods. We use some numerical examples to assess
the relative robustness of the TLHF/EnTLHF in comparison with the corresponding
KF/EnKF method.

are distinctly different. When the strain changes from -10% to +10%, the work
function of the CNT (5,5) increases monotonically from 3.95 eV to 4.57 eV, and
the work function of the (9,0) varies between 4.27 eV and 5.24 eV in a
complicated manner. When coated with potassium, for both CNTs, work functions

work functions of CNTs, which in turn will be useful in future design of

spin-down power pulsar (Edot = 3.1 * 10^36 erg/s), discovered during the Parkes
multibeam survey of the Galactic plane, with significant timing noise typical
of very young pulsars. In the very-high-energy domain, H.E.S.S. has reported
the detection of the extended source HESS J1356-645 (intrinsic Gaussian width
of 12') whose centroid lies 7' from PSR J1357-6429. Using a rotational
ephemeris obtained with 74 observations made with the Parkes telescope at 1.4
GHz, we phase-fold more than two years of gamma-ray data acquired by Fermi-LAT
as well as those collected with XMM-Newton, and perform gamma-ray spectral
modeling. Significant gamma and X-ray pulsations are detected from PSR
J1357-6429. The light curve in both bands shows one broad peak. Gamma-ray
spectral analysis of the pulsed emission suggests that it is well described by
a simple power-law of index 1.5 +/- 0.3stat +/- 0.3syst with an exponential
cut-off at 0.8 +/- 0.3stat +/- 0.3syst GeV and an integral photon flux above
100 MeV of (6.5 +/- 1.6stat +/- 2.3syst) * 10^-8 cm^-2 s^-1. The X-ray spectra
obtained from the new data provide results consistent with those reported by
Zavlin (2007). Upper limits on the gamma-ray emission from its potential pulsar
wind nebula (PWN) are also reported. Assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc, the Fermi
LAT energy flux yields a gamma-ray luminosity for PSR J1357-6429 of L_gamma =
(2.13 +/- 0.25stat +/- 0.83syst) * 10^34 erg/s, consistent with an L_gamma
\propto sqrt(Edot) relationship. The Fermi non-detection of the pulsar wind
nebula associated with HESS J1356-645 provides new constraints on the electron
population responsible for the extended TeV emission.

three positions of the long slit of the SCORPIO focal reducer, passing through
a number of large and small cavities of the gaseous disc of the galaxy. Most of
these cavities correspond exactly to the cavities in warm dust. We found that
everywhere in the direction of NGC 6946 the lines of ionized gas are decomposed
into two Gaussians, one of which shows almost constant [SII]/H-alpha and
[NII]/H-alpha ratios, as well as an almost constant radial velocity within the
measurement errors (about -35 - -50 km/s). This component is in fact the
foreground radiation from the diffuse ionized gas of our Galaxy; a similar
component is also present in the emission of neutral hydrogen. The analysis of
the component of ionized gas, occurring in NGC 6946, has revealed that it shows
signs of shock excitation in the cavities of the gaseous disc of the galaxy. It
is as well typical for the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (EDIG), observed in
a number of spiral galaxies at their high Z-coordinates. This can most likely
be explained by low density of the gas in the NGC 6946 disc (with the usual
photoionization) inside the cavities, due to what we see the spectral features
of the EDIG gas of NGC 6946, projected onto them. In the absence of separation
of ionized gas into two components by radial velocities, there is an increasing
contribution to the integral line parameters by the EDIG of our Galaxy when the
gas density in NGC 6946 decreases, which explains some strange results,
obtained in the previous studies. The morphology of warm dust, visible in the
infrared range and HI is almost the same. The shock excitation of the ionized

of nature and special relativity dictates that this must be $c$, the standard
speed of light in vacuum, a point not sufficiently emphasized in most textbooks
with the exception of a few such as Panofsky and Phillips
\cite{PanofskyPhillips}. The $c$ equivalence principle Heras
\cite{JoseAJP2010,JoseEJP2010} can be shown to be linked to the second
postulate of special relativity which extends the constancy of the unique
velocity of light to all of physics (especially to mechanics) other than
electromagnetism. An interesting corollary is that both the weak equivalence
principle of general relativity and the $c$ equivalence principle are in fact
one and the same, which we demonstrate within the context of Newtonian gravity.

correction in the particle filter is complemented by the Kalman-type correction
with the associated covariance matrices in the Gaussian mixture. We show that
this filter is an algorithm in between the Kalman filter and the particle
filter, and therefore is referred to as the particle Kalman filter (PKF). In
the PKF, the solution of a nonlinear filtering problem is expressed as the
weighted average of an ""ensemble of Kalman filters"" operating in parallel.
Running an ensemble of Kalman filters is, however, computationally prohibitive
for realistic atmospheric and oceanic data assimilation problems. For this
reason, we consider the construction of the PKF through an ""ensemble"" of
ensemble Kalman filters (EnKFs) instead, and call the implementation the
particle EnKF (PEnKF). We show that different types of the EnKFs can be
considered as special cases of the PEnKF. Similar to the situation in the
particle filter, we also introduce a re-sampling step to the PEnKF in order to
reduce the risk of weights collapse and improve the performance of the filter.

at the geographic South Pole to outbursts of MeV neutrinos from the core
collapse of nearby massive stars. IceCube was completed in December 2010
forming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1
cubic kilometer in the deep Antarctic ice for particle induced photons. The
telescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 GeV.
Owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates are
particularly low. Hence IceCube can also detect large numbers of MeV neutrinos
by observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the dark
noise. With 2 ms timing resolution, IceCube can detect subtle features in the
temporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. For a supernova at the
galactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-free
megaton-scale supernova search experiment. The sensitivity decreases to 20
standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations at
the Large Magellanic Cloud (50 kpc). IceCube is sending triggers from potential
supernovae to the Supernova Early Warning System. The sensitivity to neutrino
properties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as the
possibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of electron
neutrinos released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse.
Tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black hole
as well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrate
IceCube's capability for supernova detection.

In the case of real trigonometric polynomials, which is the primary motivation

intensity (temperature) and polarization modes induced by the graviton
non-Gaussianities, which arise from the parity-conserving and parity-violating
Weyl cubic terms with time-dependent coupling. By considering the
time-dependent coupling, we find that even in the exact de Sitter space time,
the parity violation still appears in the three-point function of the
primordial gravitational waves and could become large. Through the estimation
of the CMB bispectra, we demonstrate that the signals generated from the
parity-conserving and parity-violating terms appear in completely different
configurations of multipoles. For example, the parity-conserving
non-Gaussianity induces the nonzero CMB temperature bispectrum in the
configuration with $\sum_{n=1}^3 \ell_n = {\rm even}$ and, while due to the
parity-violating non-Gaussianity, the CMB temperature bispectrum also appears
for $\sum_{n=1}^3 \ell_n = {\rm odd}$. This signal is just good evidence of the
parity violation in the non-Gaussianity of primordial gravitational waves. We
find that the shape of this non-Gaussianity is similar to the so-called
equilateral one and the amplitudes of these spectra at large scale are roughly
estimated as $|b_{\ell \ell \ell}| \sim \ell^{-4} \times 3.2 \times 10^{-2}
({\rm GeV} / \Lambda)^2 (r / 0.1)^4$, where $\Lambda$ is an energy scale that
sets the magnitude of the Weyl cubic terms (higher derivative corrections) and
$r$ is a tensor-to-scalar ratio. Taking the limit for the nonlinearity
parameter of the equilateral type as $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm eq} < 300$, we can obtain
a bound as $\Lambda \gtrsim 3 \times 10^6 {\rm GeV}$, assuming $r=0.1$.

properties, from the structure and composition of the interior, to the

observations have paved the way to the pulsar optical identifications. The
launch of Fermi opened new perspectives in the optical-to-gamma-ray studies of
neutron stars, with the detection of more than 80 pulsars. Here, we aim to
search for optical emission from two Fermi pulsars which are interesting
targets on the basis of their spin-down age, energetics, and distance: PSR
J1357-6429and PSR J1048-5832. The two pulsars and their pulsar wind nebulae
(PWNe) are also detected in X-rays by Chandra and XMM. No deep optical
observations of these two pulsars have been reported so far. We used multi-band
optical images (V,R,I) taken with the VLT and available in the European
Southern Observatory (ESO) archive to search for, or put tight constraints to,
their optical emission. We re-assessed the positions of the two pulsars from
the analyses of all the available Chandra observations and the comparison with
the published radio coordinates. For PSR J1357-6429, this yielded a tentative
proper motion mu=0.17+/-0.055 ""/yr (70+/-15 deg position angle). We did not
detect candidate counterparts to PSR J1357-6429 and PSR J1048-5832 down to V~27
and ~27.6, respectively, although for the former we found a possible evidence
for a faint, unresolved object at the Chandra position. Our limits imply an
efficiency in converting spin-down power into optical luminosity <7x10^{-7} and
<6x10^{-6}, respectively, possibly close to that of the Vela pulsar.

an enhancement of the magnetic sensitivity by one order of magnitude by using a
simple pulsed-ESR scheme. This technique is based on repetitive excitation of
the NV defect with a resonant microwave \pi-pulse followed by an optimized
read-out laser pulse, allowing to fully eliminate power broadening of the ESR

Ramsey-type sequences, which is the optimal magnetic field sensitivity for the

by Deng et al., Phys. Rev. B. 79 075114 (2009), overcoming the restriction to
density-density interaction without increasing the complexity of the
computational algorithm. Our approach drastically reduces the problem of the
high-dimensional Gutzwiller minimization by mapping it to a minimization only
in the variational density matrix, in the spirit of the Levy and Lieb
formulation of DFT. For fixed density the Gutzwiller renormalization matrix is
determined as a fixpoint of a proper functional, whose evaluation only requires
ground-state calculations of matrices defined in the Gutzwiller variational
space. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to account for the symmetries
of the variational function in a controlled way, reducing the number of
variational parameters. After a detailed description of the method we present
calculations for multi-band Hubbard models with full (rotationally invariant)
Hund's rule on-site interaction. Our analysis shows that the numerical
algorithm is very efficient, stable and easy to implement. For these reasons
this method is particularly suitable for first principle studies -- e.g., in
combination with DFT -- of many complex real materials, where the full
intra-atomic interaction is important to obtain correct results.

var- ious least squares problems. The first step, named active orthogonization,
orthogonalizes an arbi- trary regression matrix by elaborately adding more
rows. The second step imputes the responses of the new rows. The third step
solves the least squares problem of interest for the complete orthog- onal
design. The second and third steps have simple closed forms, and iterate until
convergence. The algorithm works for ordinary least squares and regularized
least squares with the lasso, SCAD, MCP and other penalties. It has several
attractive theoretical properties. For the ordinary least squares with a
singular regression matrix, an OEM sequence converges to the Moore-Penrose gen-
eralized inverse-based least squares estimator. For the SCAD and MCP, an OEM
sequence can achieve the oracle property after sufficient iterations for a
fixed or diverging number of variables. For ordinary and regularized least
squares with various penalties, an OEM sequence converges to a point having
grouping coherence for fully aliased regression matrices. Convergence and
convergence rate of the algorithm are examined. These convergence rate results
show that for the same data set, OEM converges faster for regularized least
squares than ordinary least squares. This provides a new theoretical comparison
between these methods. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the
proposed algorithm.

AOL incident. However, storing and analyzing search logs can be very useful for
many purposes (i.e. investigating human behavior). Thus, an important research
question is how to privately sanitize search logs. Several search log
anonymization techniques have been proposed with concrete privacy models.
However, in all of these solutions, the output utility of the techniques is
only evaluated rather than being maximized in any fashion. Indeed, for
effective search log anonymization, it is desirable to derive the optimal
(maximum utility) output while meeting the privacy standard. In this paper, we
propose utility-maximizing sanitization based on the rigorous privacy standard
of differential privacy, in the context of search logs. Specifically, we
utilize optimization models to maximize the output utility of the sanitization
for different applications, while ensuring that the production process
satisfies differential privacy. An added benefit is that our novel
randomization strategy ensures that the schema of the output is identical to
that of the input. A comprehensive evaluation on real search logs validates the
approach and demonstrates its robustness and scalability.
