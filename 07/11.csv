maps, we have identified radio sources at P_{1.4GHz} >=5x10^{23} W Hz^{-1} and
X-ray point sources (XPSs) at L_{0.3-8keV}>=5x10^{42} erg s^{-1} in L>L*
galaxies in 12 high-redshift (0.4<z<1.2) clusters of galaxies. The radio
galaxies and XPSs in this cluster sample, chosen to be consistent with Coma
Cluster progenitors at these redshifts, are compared to those found at low-z
analyzed in Hart et al. (2009). Within a projected radius of 1 Mpc of the
cluster cores, we find 17 cluster radio galaxies (11 with secure redshifts,
including one luminous FR II radio source at z=0.826, and 6 more with host
galaxy colors similar to cluster ellipticals). The radio luminosity function
(RLF) of the cluster radio galaxies as a fraction of the cluster red sequence
(CRS) galaxies reveals significant evolution of this population from high-z to
low-z, with higher power radio galaxies situated in lower temperature clusters
at earlier epochs. Additionally, there is some evidence that cluster radio
galaxies become more centrally concentrated than CRS galaxies with cosmic time.
Within this same projected radius, we identify 7 spectroscopically-confirmed
cluster XPSs, all with CRS host galaxy colors. Consistent with the results from
Martini et al. (2009), we estimate a minimum X-ray active fraction of
1.4+/-0.8% for CRS galaxies in high-z clusters, corresponding to an approximate
10-fold increase from 0.15+/-0.15% at low-z. Although complete redshift
information is lacking for several XPSs in z>0.4 cluster fields, the increased
numbers and luminosities of the CRS radio galaxies and XPSs suggest a
substantial (9-10 fold) increase in the heat injected into high redshift
clusters by AGN compared to the present epoch.

H = (V,E) $ we mean the minimum number $\chi(H)$ of colors needed to paint all
the vertices in $ V $ so that any edge $ e \in E $ contains at least two
vertices of some different colors. Finally, a hypergraph is said to form a
clique, if its edges are pairwise intersecting.
  In 1973 Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz noticed that if an $n$-uniform hypergraph $ H
= (V,E) $ forms a clique, then $ \chi(H) \in \{2,3\} $. They untoduced
following quantity. $$ M(n) = \max \{|E|: \exists {\rm an} n-{\rm uniform} {\rm
clique} H = (V,E) {\rm with} \chi(H) = 3\}. $$ Obviously such definition has no
sense in the case of $ \chi(H) = 2 $.
  Theorem 1 (P. Erdos, L. Lovasz} The inequalities hold $$ n!(e-1) \le M(n) \le
n^n. $$
  Almost nothing better has been done during the last 35 years.
  At the same time, another quantity $ r(n) $ was introduced by Lovasz r(n) =
\max \{|E|: ~ \exists {\rm an} ~ n-{\rm uniform} ~ {\rm clique} ~ H = (V,E) ~
{\rm s.t.} ~ \tau(H) = n\}, $$ where $ \tau(H) $ is the {\it covering number}
of $ H $, i.e., $$ \tau(H) = \min \{|f|: ~ f \subset V, ~ \forall ~ e \in E ~ f
\cap e \neq \emptyset\}. $$ Clearly, for any $n$-uniform clique $ H $, we have
$ \tau(H) \le n $, and if $ \chi(H) = 3 $, then $ \tau(H) = n $. Thus, $ M(n)
\le r(n) $. Lov\'asz noticed that for $ r(n) $ the same estimates as in Theorem
1 apply and conjectured that the lower estimate is best possible. In 1996 P.
Frankl, K. Ota, and N. Tokushige disproved this conjecture and showed that $
r(n) \ge (\frac{n}{2})^{n-1} $.
  We discovered a new upper bound for the r(n) (so for M(n) too).
  Theorem 2. $$ M(n) \leq r(n) \le c n^{n-1/2} \ln n. $$, where c is a
constant.

optical photometry, we show that the panchromatic dataset is well-described by
non-thermal synchrotron emission (radio/mm) with inverse Compton scattering
(X-ray) of a thermal population of optical photons. In this scenario, the shock
partition fractions deviate from equipartition by a factor, (e_e/e_B) ~ 30. We
derive the properties of the shockwave and the circumstellar environment and
find a shock velocity, v~0.1c, and a progenitor mass loss rate of ~6e-5
M_sun/yr. These properties are consistent with the sub-class of Type IIb SNe
characterized by compact progenitors (Type cIIb) and dissimilar from those with
extended progenitors (Type eIIb). Furthermore, we consider the early optical
emission in the context of a cooling envelope model to estimate a progenitor
radius of ~1e+11 cm, in line with the expectations for a Type cIIb SN.
Together, these diagnostics are difficult to reconcile with the extended radius
of the putative yellow supergiant progenitor star identified in archival HST
observations, unless the stellar density profile is unusual. Finally, we
searched for the high energy shock breakout pulse using X-ray and gamma-ray
observations obtained during the purported explosion date range. Based on the

degree term in these fits measures the curvature in the spectrum. In this paper
we investigate whether the curvature parameter observed in the spectra of the
synchrotron emission can be used as a fingerprint of stochastic acceleration.
As a first approach we use the multiplicative Central Limit theorem to show how
fluctuations in the energy gain result in the broadening of the spectral shape,
introducing a curvature into the energy distribution. Then, by means of a
Monte-Carlo description, we investigate how the curvature produced in the
electron distribution is linked to the diffusion in momentum space. To get a
more generic description we turn to the diffusion equation in momentum space.
We first study some ""standard"" scenarios, in order to understand the conditions
that make the curvature in the spectra significant, and the relevance of the
cooling over the acceleration process. We try to quantify the correlation
between the curvature and the diffusive process in the pre-equilibrium stage,
and investigate how the transition between the Klein-Nishina and the Thompson
regime, in Inverse Compton cooling, can determine the curvature in the
distribution at the equilibrium. We apply these results to some observed
trends, such as the anticorrelation between the peak energy and the curvature
term observed in the spectra of Mrk 421, and a sample of BL Lac objects whose
synchrotron emission peaks at X-ray energies.

list of Nobeyama Radioheliograph in 1996-2009. We examined center-to-limb
variations of 17GHz and 34GHz flux by dividing the flare events into different
groups with respect to the 'thermal plasma richness' (ratio of the peak flux of
soft X-ray to non-thermal radio emissions) and the duration of radio bursts. It
is found that peak flux of 17 and 34GHz tend to be higher toward the limb for
thermal-rich flares with short durations. We propose that the thermal-rich
flares, which are supposed to be associated with an efficient precipitation of
high energy particles into the chromosphere, have a pitch angle distribution of
non-thermal electrons with a higher population along the flare loop.

and develop a theory of toric stacks which encompasses and extends the notions
of toric stacks defined in [Laf02, BCS05, FMN10, Iwa09, Sat12, Tyo12], as well
as classical toric varieties.
  In this paper, we define a \emph{toric stack} as a quotient of a toric
variety by a subgroup of its torus (we also define a generically stacky
version). Any toric stack arises from a combinatorial gadget called a
\emph{stacky fan}. We develop a dictionary between the combinatorics of stacky
fans and the geometry of toric stacks, stressing stacky phenomena such as
canonical stacks and good moduli space morphisms.
  We also show that smooth toric stacks carry a moduli interpretation extending
the usual moduli interpretations of $\mathbb{P}^n$ and
$[\mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{G}_m]$. Indeed, smooth toric stacks precisely solve
moduli problems specified by (generalized) effective Cartier divisors with
given linear relations and given intersection relations. Smooth toric stacks
therefore form a natural closure to the class of moduli problems introduced for
smooth toric varieties and smooth toric DM stacks in [Cox95] and [Per08],
respectively.
  We include a plethora of examples to illustrate the general theory. We hope
that this theory of toric stacks can serve as a companion to an introduction to
stacks, in much the same way that toric varieties can serve as a companion to
an introduction to schemes.

  While the focus of the prequel is on how to work with toric stacks, the focus
of this paper is how to show a stack is toric. For toric varieties, a classical
result says that any normal variety with an action of a dense open torus arises
from a fan. In [FMN09, Theorem 7.24], it is shown that a smooth separated DM

observatories such as the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi satellite may

Much recent effort has been devoted to searching for this signal around the
Milky Way's dwarf satellites. Using a new suite of high-resolution simulations
of galaxy cluster haloes (the Phoenix Project), together with the Aquarius
simulations of Milky-Way-like galaxy haloes, we show that higher
signal-to-noise and equally clean signals are, in fact, predicted to come from
nearby rich galaxy clusters. Most of the cluster emission is produced by small
subhaloes with masses less than that of the Sun. The large range of mass scales
covered by our two sets of simulations allows us to deduce a physically
motivated extrapolation to these small (and unresolved) masses. Since tidal
effects destroy subhaloes in the dense inner regions of haloes, most cluster
emission is then predicted to come from large radii, implying that the nearest
and brightest systems should be much more extended than Fermi's angular
resolution limit. The most promising targets for detection are clusters such as
Coma and Fornax, but detection algorithms must be tuned to the predicted
profile of the emission if they are to maximize the chance of finding this weak
signal.

spin- polarized current by purely electrical means1 in the absence of applied
magnetic field. Using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism (NEGF)
analysis of a small model QPC2, three ingredients were found to be essential to
generate the strong spin polarization: an asymmetric lateral confinement, a
LSOC induced by the lateral confining potential of the QPC, and a strong
electron-electron (e-e) interaction. In this paper, NEGF is used to study how
the spin polarization is affected by the presence of impurities in the central
portion of the QPC. It is found that the number, location, and shape of the
conductance anomalies, occurring below the first quantized conductance plateau
(G0=2e2/h), are strongly dependent on the nature (attractive or repulsive) and
the locations of the impurities. We show that the maximum of the conductance
spin polarization is affected by the presence of impurities. For QPCs with
impurities off-center, a conductance anomaly appears below the first integer
step even for the case of symmetric bias on the two side gates. These results
are of practical importance if QPCs in series are to be used to fabricate

Precisely, for the linearized non-homogeneous system, some $L^2$ energy
functionals and $L^2$ time-frequency functionals which are equivalent with the
naturally existing ones are designed to capture the optimal dissipation rate of
the system, which in turn yields the optimal $L^p$-$L^q$ type time-decay
estimates of the corresponding linearized solution operator. These results show
a special feature of the one-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system different
from the case of two-species, that is, the dissipation of the magnetic field in
one-species is strictly weaker than the one in two-species. As a by-product,
the global existence of solutions to the nonlinear Cauchy problem is also
proved by constructing some similar energy functionals but the time-decay rates
of the obtained solution still remain open.

nanoconfinement for liquids with water-like anomalies and liquid-liquid phase
transition (LLPT). We find that if the confinement is in an ordered matrix of
nanoparticles (NPs) the anomalies are preserved, although the LLPT shifts to
lower temperatures, higher pressures and higher densities with respect to bulk.
On the contrary, if the NPs matrix is disordered, we find a drastically
different phase diagram: the LLPT occurs only in a reduced interval of
densities and the anomalies are washed out. To understand this effect we
calculate the changes in the system at the microscopic level. In all the
different confinements considered here we observe a dramatic increase of
density of liquid near the confining NPs. In the disordered case the
confinement induces larger heterogeneity in the local density, responsible for
the weakening of the LLPT and the disappearance of anomalies.

coupled to a cavity in a one-dimensional waveguide. In the ordinary case, the

cavity because it is reflected and scattered many times. But when the two
photons are resonant with the cavity resonance reflection frequency, the
frequency spectrum of the transmitted light becomes narrower than that without
the cavity. This means that properly tuning the cavity resonance frequency can
improve the photon-photon interaction. In addition, we show that the two-photon
intensity correlation functions are nearly opposite to each other at the two
sides of the emitter transition frequency rather than be the same, which is
exactly the Fano resonance line shape for two photons. Such an effect is
important for lowering the power threshold in optical bistable devices and for
sensing applications. When the emitter transition frequency equals to the
cavity resonance frequency for a high-Q cavity, our results agree with the
recent experiments and theories.

correlations between black holes and their hosts, with 'observable' subsamples
of the whole population suggesting, on average, positive evolution even when
the underlying population is characterized by no- or negative evolution. We
create theoretical mass functions of black holes convolving the mass function
of dark matter halos with standard relationships linking black holes with their
hosts. Under these assumptions, we find that the local MBH - sigma correlation
is unable to fit the z = 6 black hole mass function proposed by Willott et al.
(2010), overestimating the number density of all but the most massive black
holes. Positive evolution or including scatter in the MBH - sigma correlation
makes the discrepancy worse, as it further increases the number density of
observable black holes. We notice that if the MBH - sigma correlation at z = 6
is steeper than today, then the mass function becomes shallower. This helps
reproducing the mass function of z = 6 black holes proposed by Willott et al.
(2010). Alternatively, it is possible that very few halos (of order 1/1000)
host an active massive black hole at z = 6, or that most AGN are obscured,
hindering their detection in optical surveys. Current measurements of the high
redshift black hole mass function might be underestimating the density of low
mass black holes if the active fraction or luminosity are a function of host or
black hole mass. Finally, we discuss physical scenarios that can possibly lead
to a steeper MBH - sigma relation at high redshift.

goal is to broadcast an n bit word to n receivers (one bit per receiver), where
the receivers have side information represented by a graph G. The objective is
to minimize the length of a codeword sent to all receivers which allows each
receiver to learn its bit. For linear index coding, the minimum possible length
is known to be equal to a graph parameter called minrank (Bar-Yossef et al.,
FOCS, 2006).
  We show a polynomial time algorithm that, given an n vertex graph G with
minrank k, finds a linear index code for G of length $\widetilde{O}(n^{f(k)})$,
where f(k) depends only on k. For example, for k=3 we obtain f(3) ~ 0.2574. Our
algorithm employs a semidefinite program (SDP) introduced by Karger, Motwani
and Sudan (J. ACM, 1998) for graph coloring and its refined analysis due to
Arora, Chlamtac and Charikar (STOC, 2006). Since the SDP we use is not a
relaxation of the minimization problem we consider, a crucial component of our
analysis is an upper bound on the objective value of the SDP in terms of the
minrank.
  At the heart of our analysis lies a combinatorial result which may be of
independent interest. Namely, we show an exact expression for the maximum
possible value of the Lovasz theta-function of a graph with minrank k. This
yields a tight gap between two classical upper bounds on the Shannon capacity
of a graph.

first pattern is created for a very short evaporation time and consists of
rough steps. The second pattern built by curly steps is characteristic for
longer evaporation times and lower temperatures. The third pattern, in which

extragalactic objects allowing to investigate a wide range of problems, linked
with the formation and evolution of galaxies, and to study the properties of
their dark haloes. The progress in the study of PRGs is constrained by a small
number of known objects of this type. Up to date, we can only attribute about
two dozens of kinematically-confirmed galaxies to this class, mostly from
Whitmore et al. (1990) catalogue. We present a new catalogue of PRGs based on
the results of the original Galaxy Zoo project. Based on the preliminary
classification of the Galaxy Zoo, we viewed more than 40000 images of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and selected 275 galaxies, included in our catalogue.
Our Sloan-based Polar Ring Catalog (SPRC) contains 70 galaxies that we
classified as ""the best candidates"", among which we expect to have a very high
proportion of true PRGs, and 115 good PRG candidates. 53 galaxies are
classified as PRG related objects.We identified 37 galaxies that have their
presumed polar rings seen almost face-on. The SPRC objects are on the average
fainter and located further away than the galaxies from the catalog by Whitmore
et al., although our catalogue does include dozens of new nearby candidate
PRGs. The new catalogue significantly increases the number of genuine PRG
candidates, and may serve as a good basis both for the further detailed study
of individual galaxies, and for the statistical analysis of PRGs as a separate
class of objects. We performed spectroscopic observations of six galaxies from
the SPRC at the 6-m telescope. The existence of polar rings was confirmed in
five galaxies, and one object appeared to be a projection of a pair of
galaxies. Adding the literature data, we can already classify 10 galaxies from
our catalogue to the kinematically-confirmed PRGs.

region explosive events, observations that lend empirical evidence that at
least in some cases explosive events may be nothing else than spinning narrow
spicule-like structures. Our spectra of textbook explosive events with
simultaneous Doppler flow of a red and of a blue component are extreme cases of
high spectro-scopic velocities that lack apparent motion, to be expected if
interpreted as a pair of collimated, linearly moving jets. The awareness of
this conflict led us to the alternate interpretation of redshift and blueshift
as spinning motion of a small plasma volume. In contrast to the bidirectional
jet scenario, a small volume of spinning plasma would be fully compatible with
the observation of flows without detectable apparent motion. We suspect that
these small volumes could be spicule-like structures and try to find evidence.
We show observations of helical motion in macrospicules and argue that these
features - if scaled down to a radius comparable to the slit size of a
spectrometer - should have a spectroscopic signature similar to that observed
in explosive events, while not easily detectable by imagers. Despite of this
difficulty, evidence of helicity in spicules has been reported in the
literature. This inspired us to the new insight that the same narrow spinning
structures may be the drivers in both cases, structures that imagers observe as
spicules and that in spectrometers cross the slit and are seen as explosive
events. We arrive at a concept that supports the idea that explosive events and
spicules are different manifestations of the same helicity driven scenario.
Consequently, in such a case, a photospheric or subphotosperic trigger has to
be assumed.

distributed multihop packet delivery algorithm. The fractions of the total
available bandwidth on each channel is assigned to several traffic classes by
which the time it takes to traverse each of the hops from the source to the

contribution of the paper is a novel non-parametric two-sample homogeneity test

proposed two-sample homogeneity test statistic can be extended to deal with
ordinal or censored data as well as to test for the homogeneity of more than
two samples. The second contribution of the paper concerns the use of the
proposed test statistic to perform retrospective change-point analysis. It is
first shown that the approach is computationally feasible even when looking for
a large number of change-points thanks to the use of dynamic programming.
Computable asymptotic $p$-values for the test are then provided in the case
where a single potential change-point is to be detected. Compared to available
alternatives, the proposed approach appears to be very reliable and robust.
This is particularly true in situations where the data is contaminated by
outliers or corrupted by noise and where the potential changes only affect

some deuterated interstellar molecules are markedly larger than the cosmic D/H
ratio of 10-5. Possible reasons for this pointed to grain surface chemistry.
How- ever, organic molecules and water, which are both ice constituents, do not
enjoy the same deuteration. For example, deuterated formaldehyde is very
abundant in comets and star forming regions, while deuterated water rarely is.
In this article, we explain this selective deuteration by following the
formation of ices (using the rate equation method) in translucent clouds, as
well as their evolu- tion as the cloud collapses to form a star. Ices start
with the deposition of gas phase CO and O onto dust grains. While reaction of
oxygen with atoms (H or D) or molecules (H2) yields H2O (HDO), CO only reacts
with atoms (H and D) to form H2CO (HDCO, D2CO). As a result, the deuteration of
formaldehyde is sensitive to the gas D/H ratio as the cloud undergoes
gravitational collapse, while the deuteration of water strongly depends on the
dust temperature at the time of ice formation. These results reproduce well the
deuterium fractionation of formaldehyde observed in comets and star forming
regions and can explain the wide spread of deuterium fractionation of water
observed in these environments.

extend at least up to 200 AU. We report an increase of one order of magnitude
in the H2 1-0 S(1) line flux with respect to previous measurements taken in
2003 for this star, which suggests line variability. In HD 100546 the emission
is tentatively spatially resolved and may extend at least up to 50 AU. Modeling
of the H2 1-0 S(1) line profiles and their spatial extent with flat keplerian

limits to the H2 1-0 S(0)/ 1-0 S(1) and H2 2-1 S(1)/1-0 S(1) line ratios in HD
97048 are consistent with H2 gas at T>2000 K and suggest that the emission
observed may be produced by X-ray excitation. The upper limits for the line
ratios for HD 100546 are inconclusive. Because the H2 emission is located at
large radii, for both sources a thermal emission scenario (i.e., gas heated by
collisions with dust) is implausible. We argue that the observation of H2
emission at large radii may be indicative of an extended disk atmosphere at
radii >5 AU. This may be explained by a hydrostatic disk in which gas and dust
are thermally decoupled or by a disk wind caused by photoevaporation.

programs. Hence, one has to recur the results of data races to
deterministically replay a multi-threaded program. However, data races are
concealed in enormous number of memory operations in a program. Due to the
difficulty of accurately identifying data races, previous multi-threaded
deterministic record/replay schemes for commodity multi-processor system give
up to record data races directly. Consequently, they either record all shared
memory operations, which brings remarkable slowdown to the production run, or
record the synchronization only, which introduces significant efforts to
replay.
  Inspired by the advances in data race detection, we propose an efficient
software-only deterministic replay scheme for commodity multi-processor
systems, which is named RacX. The key insight of RacX is as follows: although
it is NP-hard to accurately identify the existence of data races between a pair
of memory operations, we can find out all potential data races in a
multi-threaded program, in which the false positives can be reduced to a small
amount with our automatic false positive reduction techniques. As a result,
RacX can efficiently monitor all potential data races to deterministically
replay a multi-threaded program.
  To evaluate RacX, we have carried out experiments over a number of well-known
multi-threaded programs from SPLASH-2 benchmark suite and large-scale
commercial programs. RacX can precisely recur production runs of these programs
with value determinism. Averagely, RacX causes only about 1.21%, 1.89%, 2.20%,
and 8.41% slowdown to the original run during recording (for 2-, 4-, 8- and
16-thread programs, respectively). The soundness, efficiency, scalability, and
portability of RacX well demonstrate its superiority.

the problem of continuity and robustness of the value function in concurrent

conformational changes of CaM via simultaneous twist-bend motions of the two
lobes. We utilize perturbation-response scanning (PRS) technique, coupled with
molecular dynamics simulations to analyze conformational preferences of
calcium-loaded CaM, initially in extended form. PRS is comprised of sequential
application of directed forces on residues followed by recording the resulting
coordinates. We show that manipulation of a single residue, E31 located in one
of the EF hand motifs, reproduces structural changes to compact forms, and the
flexible linker acts as a transducer of binding information to distant parts of
the protein. Independently, using four different pKa calculation strategies, we
find E31 to be the charged residue (out of 52), whose ionization state is most
sensitive to subtle pH variations in the physiological range. It is proposed
that at relatively low pH, CaM structure is less flexible. By gaining charged
states at specific sites at a pH value around 7, local conformational changes
in the protein will lead to shifts in the energy landscape, paving the way to
other conformational states. These findings are in accordance with FRET
measured shifts in conformational distributions towards more compact forms with
decreased pH. They also corroborate mutational studies and proteolysis results
which point to the significant role of E31 in CaM dynamics.

measure. If $P$ is the measure induced by rate $\kappa,$ simple, symmetric
random walk on $Z^d$ started at $x,$ this measure is defined as $$
d\mu(X)={Z^{-1} \exp\{\beta\int_0^T dW_{X(s)}(s)\}dP(X) $$ where $\{W_x:x\in
Z^d\}$ is a field of $iid$ standard, one-dimensional Brownian motions,
$\beta>0, \kappa>0$ and $Z$ the normalizing constant. We establish that the
polymer measure gives a macroscopic mass to a small neighborhood of a typical
path as $T \to \infty$, for parameter values outside the perturbative regime of
the random walk, giving a pathwise approach to polymer localization, in
contrast with existing results. The localization becomes complete as
$\frac{\beta^2}{\kappa}\to\infty$ in the sense that the mass grows to 1. The
proof makes use of the overlap between two independent samples drawn under the
Gibbs measure $\mu$, which can be estimated by the integration by parts formula
for the Gaussian environment. Conditioning this measure on the number of jumps,
we obtain a canonical measure which already shows scaling properties,
thermodynamic limits, and decoupling of the parameters.

[FG11], using closures of pre-Dirichlet forms which were already proposed in
[GP87] and [Osa98]. The environment dynamics and the coupled dynamics of the
tagged particle and the environment were constructed separately. Here we
continue the analysis of these processes: Proving an essential m-dissipativity
result for the generator of the coupled dynamics from [FG11], we show that this
dynamics does not only contain the environment dynamics (as one component), but
is, given the latter, the only possible choice for being the coupled process.
Moreover, we identify the uniform motion of the environment as the reversed
motion of the tagged particle. (Since the dynamics are constructed as
martingale solutions on configuration space, this is not immediate.)
Furthermore, we prove ergodicity of the environment dynamics, whenever the
underlying reference measure is a pure phase of the system. Finally, we show
that these considerations are sufficient to apply [DMFGW89] for proving an
invariance principle for the tagged particle process. We remark that such an
invariance principle was studied before in [GP87] for smooth potentials, and
shown by abstract Dirichlet form methods in [Osa98] for singular potentials.

efficiency should be less than 0.366 and accretion rate is much larger than
previous analysis by B. Nayak et al. \cite{ns}. Thus here primordial black
holes live longer than previous works \cite{ns}. Again matter accretion
slightly increases the mass and lifetime of primordial black holes. However,
the vacuum energy accretion is slightly complicated one, where accretion is
possible only upto a critical time. This critical time depends on the values of
accretion efficiency and formation time. If a primordial black hole lives
beyond critical time, then its lifespan increases due to vacuum energy
accretion. But for presently evaporating primordial black holes, critical time
comes much later than their evaporating time and thus vacuum energy could not
affect those primordial black holes. We again found that the constraints on the

becomes stronger in the presence of vacuum energy.

steal information from its victims. Unlike conventional botnets, Stegobot
traffic does not introduce new communication endpoints between bots. We

and a rotation period P_rot = 5.4 +/- 0.4 days. The age of the system remains
uncertain, with stellar evolution models pointing either to a few tens Ma or
several Ga, while gyrochronology and lithium abundance point towards ages of a
few hundred Ma. This mismatch potentially points to a problem in our
understanding of the evolution of young stars, with possibly significant
implications for stellar physics and the interpretation of inferred sizes of
exoplanets around young stars. We detected the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly in
the CoRoT-18 system thanks to the spectroscopic observation of a transit. We
measured the obliquity psi = 20 +/- 20 degrees (sky-projected value: lambda =
-10 +/- 20 degrees), indicating that the planet orbits in the same way as the
star is rotating and that this prograde orbit is nearly aligned with the
stellar equator.

Barrel/TAPS detector for incident photon energies up to 2.5 GeV. The
$\eta$-mesons have been detected in coincidence with recoil protons and

studied via a comparison of the quasi-free reaction off the bound proton to
$\eta$-production off the free proton. No significant effects beyond the
folding of the free cross section with the momentum distribution of the bound
protons have been found. These Fermi motion effects can be removed by an
analysis using the invariant mass of the $\eta$-nucleon pairs reconstructed
from the final state four-momenta of the particles. The total cross section for
quasi-free $\eta$-photoproduction off the neutron reveals even without
correction for Fermi motion a pronounced bump-like structure around 1 GeV of
incident photon energy, which is not observed for the proton. This structure is
even narrower in the invariant mass spectrum of the $\eta$-neutron pairs.
Position and width of the peak in the invariant mass spectrum are $W\approx

divergence singularities in the plane-wave summation of electrostatic and

reciprocal-space countercharge corrections that cancel plane-wave singularities
through the addition of an auxiliary function to the point-charge electrostatic
kernel that enters into the expression of interaction terms. At variance with
real-space countercharge corrections that are employed in the context of
density-functional theory (DFT), reciprocal-space corrections are
computationally inexpensive, making them suited to more demanding OD-DFT
calculations. Nevertheless, there exists much freedom in the choice of
auxiliary functions and various definitions result in different levels of
performance in eliminating plane-wave inaccuracies. In this work, we derive
exact point-charge auxiliary functions for the description of molecular
structures of arbitrary translational symmetry, including the yet unaddressed
one-dimensional case. In addition, we provide a critical assessment of
different reciprocal-space countercharge corrections and demonstrate the

The rotation velocity is nominally 10-15 km/s, but rises to ~20 km/s after
correction for the ~8-10 km/s random motions present in the gas. The velocity
field is complex; including a variation in the position angle of the major axis
going from the NE to the SW parts of the galaxy. Our high resolution HI maps
reveal structure in the central gas, including a large, low-density HI
depression or hole between the southern and northern halves of the galaxy,
coincident with an unresolved x-ray source. Although interactions have been
proposed as the triggering mechanism for the vigorous star formation occurring
in BCDs, VII Zw 403 does not seem to have been tidally triggered by an external
interaction, as we have found no nearby possible perturbers. It also doesn't
appear to fall in the set of galaxies that exhibit a strong central mass
density concentration, as its optical scale length is large in comparison to

Ceres is the most massive body of the asteroid belt and contains
about 25 wt.% (weight percent) of water. Understanding its thermal evolution
and assessing its current state are major goals of the Dawn Mission.
Constraints on internal structure can be inferred from various observations.
Especially, detailed knowledge of the rotational motion can help constrain the
mass distribution inside the body, which in turn can lead to information on its
geophysical history. Aims. We investigate the signature of the interior on the
rotational motion of Ceres and discuss possible future measurements performed
by the spacecraft Dawn that will help to constrain Ceres' internal structure.
Methods. We compute the polar motion, precession-nutation, and length-of-day
variations. We estimate the amplitudes of the rigid and non-rigid response for
these various motions for models of Ceres interior constrained by recent shape
data and surface properties. Results. As a general result, the amplitudes of
oscillations in the rotation appear to be small, and their determination from
spaceborne techniques will be challenging. For example, the amplitudes of the
semi-annual and annual nutations are around ~364 and ~140 milli-arcseconds, and
they show little variation within the parametric space of interior models
envisioned for Ceres. This, combined with the very long-period of the
precession motion, requires very precise measurements. We also estimate the
timescale for Ceres' orientation to relax to a generalized Cassini State, and
we find that the tidal dissipation within that object was probably too small to

combining the shape and gravity observations by Dawn offers the prospect to
identify departures of non-hydrostaticity at the global and regional scale,
which will be instrumental in constraining Ceres' past and current thermal
state. We also discuss the existence of a possible Chandler mode in the
rotational motion of Ceres, whose potential excitation by endogenic and/or
exogenic processes may help detect the presence of liquid reservoirs within the
asteroid.

trait structure and ecological interactions. Traits are hereditarily
transmitted from a parent to its offspring unless a mutation occurs. The
dynamics may depend on the trait of the ancestors and on its past and allows
interactions between individuals through their lineages. We define an
interacting historical particle process describing the genealogies of the
living individuals; it takes values in the space of point measures on an
infinite dimensional c\`adl\`ag path space. This individual-based process can
be approximated by a nonlinear historical superprocess, under the assumptions
of large populations, small individuals and allometric demographies. Because of
the interactions, the branching property fails and we use martingale problems
and fine couplings between our population and independent branching particles.
Our convergence theorem is illustrated by two examples of current interest in
biology. The first one relates the biodiversity history of a population and its
phylogeny, while the second treats a spatial model with competition between
individuals through their past trajectories.

that many, maybe all the Globular Clusters (GC) host multiple stellar
populations. High-resolution spectroscopy has established that, while most GCs
are mono-metallic with no significant abundance spread in $s$-elements, in all
the globulars studied to date the presence of different stellar generation is
inferred by the Na-O and the C-N anticorrelations. In this context, NGC 1851
and NGC 6656 are among the most intriguing clusters. Contrary to the majority
of GCs, they host two groups of stars with different s-elements abundance that
are clearly associated to the two distinct sub-giant and red-giant branches
detected in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). In the case of NGC 6656
s-rich stars are also enriched in iron and calcium. Each $s$-element group
exhibits its own Na-O and C-N anticorrelations thus indicating the presence of
sub-populations and suggesting that the parent clusters have experienced a very
complex star-formation history. In this paper we summarize the properties of
multiple populations in NGC 1851 and NGC 6656.

electromagnetic fields to produce effects such as perfect imaging and spatial
cloaking. To achieve spatial cloaking, the index of refraction is manipulated
to flow light from a probe around an object in such a way that a ""hole"" in
space is created, and it remains hidden. Alternatively, it may be desirable to
cloak the occurrence of an event over a finite time period, and the idea of
temporal cloaking was proposed in which the dispersion of the material is
manipulated in time to produce a ""time hole"" in the probe beam to hide the
occurrence of the event from the observer. This approach is based on
accelerating and slowing down the front and rear parts, respectively, of the
probe beam to create a well controlled temporal gap in which the event occurs
so the probe beam is not modified in any way by the event. The probe beam is
then restored to its original form by the reverse manipulation of the
dispersion. Here we present an experimental demonstration of temporal cloaking
by applying concepts from the time-space duality between diffraction and
dispersive broadening. We characterize the performance of our temporal cloak by
detecting the spectral modification of a probe beam due to an optical
interaction while the cloak is turned off and on and show that the event is
observed when the cloak is turned off but becomes undetectable when the cloak
is turned on. These results are a significant step toward the development of
full spatio-temporal cloaking.
