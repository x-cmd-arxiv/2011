observational hints of statistical isotropy breaking. Some of these features
can be studied within the framework of primordial vector fields in inflationary
theories which generally display some level of statistical anisotropy both in
the power spectrum and in higher-order correlation functions. Motivated by
these observations and the recent theoretical developments in the study of
primordial vector fields, we develop the formalism necessary to extract
statistical anisotropy information from the three-point function of the CMB
temperature anisotropy. We employ a simplified vector field model and
parametrize the bispectrum of curvature fluctuations in such a way that all the
information about statistical anisotropy is encoded in some parameters
lambda_{LM} (which measure the anisotropic to the isotropic bispectrum
amplitudes). For such a template bispectrum, we compute an optimal estimator
for lambda_{LM} and the expected signal-to-noise ratio. We estimate that, for
f_{NL} ~ 30, an experiment like Planck can be sensitive to a ratio of the
anisotropic to the isotropic amplitudes of the bispectrum as small as 10%. Our
results are complementary to the information coming from a power spectrum
analysis and particularly relevant for those models where statistical
anisotropy turns out to be suppressed in the power spectrum but not negligible
in the bispectrum.

compactifications with a low string scale. In D-brane models they are
associated to U(1) gauge symmetries that are either anomalous in four
dimensions or exhibit a hidden higher dimensional anomaly. We discuss the
possible signals of massive Z'-gauge bosons at hadron collider machines
(Tevatron, LHC) in a minimal D-brane model consisting out of four stacks of
D-branes. In this construction, there are two massive gauge bosons, which can
be naturally associated with baryon number B and B-L (L being lepton number).
Here baryon number is always anomalous in four dimensions, whereas the presence
of a four-dimensional B-L anomaly depends on the U(1)-charges of the right
handed neutrinos. In case B-L is anomaly free, a mass hierarchy between the two
associated Z'-gauge bosons can be explained. In our phenomenological discussion
about the possible discovery of massive Z'-gauge bosons, we take as a benchmark
scenario the dijet plus W signal, recently observed by the CDF Collaboration at
Tevatron. It reveals an excess in the dijet mass range 150 GeV/c^2, 4.1\sigma
beyond SM expectations. We show that in the context of low-mass string theory
this excess can be associated with the production and decay of a leptophobic
Z', a singlet partner of SU(3) gluons coupled primarily to baryon number. Even
if the CDF signal disappears, as indicated by the more recent D0 results, our
analysis can still serve as the basis for future experimental search for
massive Z'-gauge bosons in low string scale models. We provide the relevant
cross sections for the production of Z'-gauge bosons in the TeV region, leading
to predictions that are within reach of the present or the next LHC run.

two periodic trends as a function of the number of valence electrons: if the
substituted atom has six or fewer valence electrons (Ti-Cr or Zr-Mo), the
number of down spin electrons associated with the impurity ion is zero,
resulting in ferromagnetic (FM) alignment of the impurity magnetic moment with
the magnetization of the CrO2 host. For substituent atoms with eight to ten

contributed by the impurity ion remains fixed at three as the number
contributed to the majority increases from one to three resulting in
antiferromagnetic (AFM) alignment between impurity moment and host
magnetization. The origin of this variation is the grouping of the impurity
states into 3 states with approximate ""t2g"" symmetry and 2 states with
approximate ""eg"" symmetry. Ni is an exception to the rule because a
Jahn-Teller-like distortion causes a splitting of the Ni eg states. For Mn and
Tc, which have 8 valence electrons, the zero down spin and 3 down spin
configurations are very close in energy. For Cu and Ag atoms, which have 11
valence electrons, the energy is minimized when the substituent ion contributes
5 Abstract down-spin electrons. We find that the interatomic exchange
interactions are reduced for all substitutions except for the case of Fe for

magnetic field which is produced in the bubbles of a first order phase
transition endangers the baryon asymmetry produced in the bubble walls. The
reason being that the produced magnetic field couples to the sphaleron magnetic
moment and lowers the sphaleron energy; this strengthens the sphaleron
transitions inside the bubbles and triggers a more effective wash out of the

Higgs mass required to preserve the baryon asymmetry is below the present
experimental bound. As a consequence electroweak baryogenesis within the MSSM
should be confronted on the one hand to future measurements at the LHC on the
Higgs and the right-handed stop masses, and on the other hand to more precise

present here an analysis of tree-level amplitudes for processes in which an
NS-NS string state from the leading Regge trajectory scatters from a D-brane
into another state from the leading Regge trajectory, in general of a different
mass, at high energies and small scattering angles. This is done by using
world-sheet OPE methods and effective vertex operators. We find that this class
of processes has a universal dependence on the energy of the projectile and
that the tree-level amplitudes are in agreement with the eikonal operator form
of the string S-matrix.

next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) spin1-spin2 conservative potential for a
binary. Hereby, we first demonstrate the ability of the EFT approach to go at
NNLO in post-Newtonian (PN) corrections from spin effects. The NNLO spin1-spin2
interaction is evaluated at fourth PN order for a binary of maximally rotating
compact objects. This sector includes contributions from diagrams, which are
not pure spin1-spin2 diagrams, as they contribute through the leading-order
spin accelerations and precessions, that should be first taken into account
here. The fact that the spin is derivative-coupled adds significantly to the
complexity of computations. In particular, for the irreducible two-loop
diagrams, which are the most complicated to evaluate in this sector,
irreducible two-loop tensor integrals up to order 4 are required. The EFT
calculation is carried out in terms of the nonrelativistic gravitational (NRG)
fields. However, not all of the benefits of the NRG fields apply to spin
interactions, as all possible diagram topologies are realized at each order of
$G$ included. Still, the NRG fields remain advantageous, and thus there was no
use of automated computations in this work. Our final result can be reduced,
and a corresponding Hamiltonian may be derived.

by two-body modes is 10.2+-3.0%, slightly smaller than the short-distance
result of 13.3+-3.2%. The contribution to width difference by D*_s0(2317),
D_s1(2460), and D_s1(2536) resonances is negligible. For the three-body modes,
we adopt the factorization formalism and model the form factors with off-shell
D^(*)_s poles, the D_{sJ}(2700) resonance, and non-resonant (NR) contributions.
These three-body modes can arise through current-produced or transition
diagrams, but only SU(3)-related D^(*)_{u,d} \Dbar^(*)\Kbar modes from current
diagram have been measured so far. The pole model results for D^*_{u,d}
\Dbar^(*)\Kbar agree well with data, while D_{u,d} \Dbar^(*)\Kbar rates agree
with data only within a factor of 2 to 3. All measured three-body rates can be
reproduced by including NR contribution. The total \Delta{\Gamma}s/{\Gamma}s
obtained is 16.7+-8.5%, which agrees with the short-distance result within
uncertainties. For illustration, we also demonstrate the effect of D_{sJ}(2700)
in modes with D^(*)K^*. In all scenarios, the total width difference remain
consistence to the short-distance result. Our result indicates that (a) the
operator product expansion (OPE) in short-distance picture is a valid
assumption, (b) approximating the two-body decays to saturate width difference
has a large correction, (c) the effect of three-body modes cannot be neglected,

Possibly the supernova remnant provides additional turbulence to the gas in
this region, through which the maser emission must travel. The masers in the
southern interaction region are located on the outermost edge of SgrAEast which
line of sight is not covered by either absorbing OH gas or a supernova remnant,
in agreement with the much lower variability level observed. Similarly, the
masers associated with the CND show little variability, consistent with them
arising through collisions between relatively large clumps of gas in the CND
and no significant amount of turbulent gas along the line of sight.

results show that the scan statistic, a popular tool for detection problems, is
optimal only for the detection of signals with the smallest spatial extent. For
signals with larger spatial extent the scan is suboptimal, and the power loss
can be considerable. In contrast, the average likelihood ratio statistic is
optimal for the detection of signals on all scales except the smallest ones,
where its performance is only slightly suboptimal. We give rigorous
mathematical statements of these results as well as heuristic explanations

quite generally, such as the detection of clusters in models involving
densities or intensities or the detection of multivariate signals. We present a
modification of the average likelihood ratio that yields optimal detection of
signals with arbitrary spatial extent and which has the additional benefit of
allowing for a fast computation of the statistic. In contrast, optimal
detection with the scan seems to require the use of scale-dependent critical

low mass region is more challenging at the LHC, but if the Higgs has Standard
Model (SM)-like properties, the LHC should find evidence for it by the end of
next year. In low energy supersymmetric extensions of the SM, the situation is
similar for large values of the CP-odd Higgs mass $m_A$, but more interesting
for lower values of $m_A$. The ($\sqrt{s}$ =7 TeV) LHC searches for a low-mass
Standard Model Higgs boson predominantly in the $h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma,WW$
decay modes, which may be suppressed by an increase in the $h\rightarrow

$m_A\lesssim 500$ GeV. Although $h\rightarrow b\bar{b}, \tau^+ \tau^-$ are
sought at the LHC, these channels are not powerful enough to fully counter this

possibilities for probing the low $m_A$ region: nonstandard Higgs boson
searches at the LHC, and a statistical combination with the Tevatron, where
$Vh\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ is the primary search channel for light $h$. We also
study an MSSM scenario in which the $h\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ rate is enhanced
at low $m_A$ to the point where discovery is possible in the near future.

mapping is within 45 degrees of normal to the outflow axis in more than half
the sample. Furthermore, the velocity gradients are often quite substantial,
the average being ~2.3 km\s\pc. The interferometric data often reveal
small-scale velocity structure, departing from the more gradual large-scale
velocity gradients. In some cases, this likely indicates accelerating infall
and/or rotational spin-up in the inner envelope; the median velocity gradient
from the interferometric data is ~10.7 km/s/pc. In two systems, we detect

interactions, non-magnetic disorder and localization, yet topology does not
yield protection in transport. This work presents a theory of interacting
topological insulators in an external electric field, starting from the quantum
Liouville equation for the many-body density matrix. Out of equilibrium,
topological insulators acquire a current-induced spin polarization.
Electron-electron interactions renormalize the non-equilibrium spin
polarization and charge conductivity, and disorder in turn enhances this
renormalization by a factor of two. Topological insulator phenomenology remains
intact in the presence of interactions out of equilibrium, and an exact
correspondence exists between the mathematical frameworks necessary for the
understanding of the interacting and non-interacting problems.

at the Tevatron. We examine the essential observables of these models for top
physics at LHC7 with 1 fb^{-1} of data, including the total cross-section,
invariant mass distribution and number of additional jets in t tbar events. In
the case of t-channel mediators, the LHC total cross-section places a strong
constraint on light mediators, while the Tevatron invariant mass distributions
place strong constraints on heavy mediators that are able to produce the
asymmetry. Heavy axigluons are becoming increasingly squeezed by LHC7 t tbar

important information on their assembly and formation history as the properties
of the discs resident in their centres. In this paper we have used the
Constrained Local UniversE Simulation project to disentangle the stellar and DM
component of three galaxies that resemble the MW, M31 and M33 using both DM
only and DM + gas-dynamical simulations. Stars that are accreted in
substructures and then stripped follow a completely different radial
distribution than the stripped DM: the stellar halo is much more centrally
concentrated than DM. In order to understand how the same physical process can
lead to different z=0 radial profiles, we examined the potential at accretion
of each stripped particle. We found that star particles sit at systematically
higher potentials than DM, making them harder to strip. We then searched for a
threshold in the potential of accreted particles \phi_[th], above which DM
particles behave as star particles. We found such a threshold at >16
\phi_{subhalo}, where \phi_{subhalo} is the potential at a subhaloes edge at
the time of accretion. Thus a rule as simple as selecting particles according
to their potential at accretion is able to reproduce the effect that the
complicated physics of star formation has on the stellar distribution. This
niversal result reproduces the stellar halo to an accuracy of within ~2%.
Studies which make use of DM particles as a proxy for stars will undoubtedly
miscalculate their proper radial distribution and structure unless particles
are selected according to their potential at accretion. Furthermore, we have
examined the time it takes to strip a given star or DM particle after
accretion. We find that, owing to their higher binding energies, stars take
longer to be stripped than DM. The stripped DM halo is thus considerably older
than the stripped stellar halo.

star-forming galaxies with multiple-peaked Ly-alpha profiles. With our large
spectroscopic database of UV-selected star-forming galaxies at these redshifts,
we have determined that ~30% of such objects with detectable Ly-alpha emission
display multiple-peaked emission profiles. These profiles provide additional
constraints on the escape of Ly-alpha photons due to the rich velocity
structure in the emergent line. Despite recent advances in modeling the escape
of Ly-alpha from star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, comparisons between
models and data are often missing crucial observational information. Using Keck
II NIRSPEC spectra of H-alpha (z~2) and [OIII] 5007 (z~3), we have measured
accurate systemic redshifts, rest-frame optical nebular velocity dispersions
and emission-line fluxes for the objects in the sample. Accurate systemic
redshifts allow us to translate the multiple-peaked Ly-alpha profiles into
velocity space, revealing that the majority (11/18) display double-peaked
emission straddling the velocity-field zeropoint with stronger red-side
emission. We compare our data with the predictions of simple models for
outflowing and infalling gas distributions around high-redshift galaxies. While
popular ""shell"" models provide a qualitative match with many of the
observations of Ly-alpha emission, we find that in detail there are important
discrepancies between the models and data, as well as problems with applying
the framework of an expanding thin shell of gas to explain high-redshift galaxy
spectra. Our data highlight these inconsistencies, as well as illuminating
critical elements for success in future models of outflow and infall in
high-redshift galaxies. [Abridged]

hosting an AGN at fixed X-ray luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass, the
distribution of X-ray luminosities is independent of mass. Furthermore, we show
that the probability that a galaxy will host an AGN can be defined by a
universal Eddington ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxy
stellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope -0.65. These results
demonstrate that AGNs are prevalent at all stellar masses in the range 9.5<log
M_*/M_sun<12 and that the same physical processes regulate AGN activity in all
galaxies in this stellar mass range. While a higher AGN fraction may be
observed in massive galaxies, this is a selection effect related to the
underlying Eddington ratio distribution. We also find that the AGN fraction
drops rapidly between z~1 and the present day and is moderately enhanced
(factor~2) in galaxies with blue or green optical colors. Consequently, while
AGN activity and star formation appear to be globally correlated, we do not
find evidence that the presence of an AGN is related to the quenching of star
formation or the color transformation of galaxies.

forming galaxies at z~0.84, selected by their H-alpha flux with a NB filter.
B-band luminosities of the objects are higher than those of local star forming
galaxies. Most of the galaxies are located in the blue cloud, though some
objects are detected in the green valley and in the red sequence. After the
extinction correction is applied virtually all these red galaxies move to the
blue sequence, unveiling their dusty nature. A check on the extinction law
reveals that the typical extinction law for local starbursts is well suited for
our sample but with E(B-V)_stars=0.55 E(B-V)_gas. We compare star formation
rates (SFR) measured with different tracers (H-alpha, UV and IR) finding that
they agree within a factor of three after extinction correction. We find a
correlation between the ratios SFR_FUV/SFR_H-alpha, SFR_IR/SFR_H-alpha and the
EW(H-alpha) (i.e. weighted age) which accounts for part of the scatter. We
obtain stellar mass estimations fitting templates to multi-wavelength
photometry. The typical stellar mass of a galaxy within our sample is ~10^10
Msun. The SFR is correlated with stellar mass and the specific star formation
rate (sSFR) decreases with it, indicating that massive galaxies are less
affected by star formation processes than less massive ones. This result is
consistent with the downsizing scenario. To quantify this downsizing we
estimated the quenching mass M_Q for our sample at z~0.84, finding that it
declines from M_Q ~10^12 Msun to M_Q ~8x10^10 Msun at the local Universe.

function (BHMF) of broad-line quasars with forward Bayesian modeling in the

DR7 quasars at z ~ 0.3-5. We take into account the selection effect of the
sample flux limit; more importantly, we deal with the statistical scatter
between true BH masses and FWHM-based single-epoch virial mass estimates, as
well as potential luminosity-dependent biases of these mass estimates. The LF
is tightly constrained in the regime sampled by SDSS, and makes reasonable
predictions when extrapolated to ~ 3 magnitudes fainter. Downsizing is seen in
the model LF. On the other hand, we find it difficult to constrain the BHMF to
within a factor of a few at z>~0.7 (with MgII and CIV-based virial BH masses).
This is mainly driven by the unknown luminosity-dependent bias of these mass
estimators and its degeneracy with other model parameters, and secondly driven
by the fact that SDSS quasars only sample the tip of the active BH population
at high redshift. Nevertheless, the most likely models favor a positive
luminosity-dependent bias for MgII and possibly for CIV, such that at fixed
true BH mass, objects with higher-than-average luminosities have over-estimated
FWHM-based virial masses. There is tentative evidence that downsizing also
manifests itself in the active BHMF, and the BH mass density in broad-line
quasars contributes an insignificant amount to the total BH mass density at all
times. Within our model uncertainties, we do not find a strong BH mass
dependence of the mean Eddington ratio; but there is evidence that the mean
Eddington ratio (at fixed BH mass) increases with redshift.

auxiliary supporting queue/stash structure that is super-sized with respect to
traditional auxiliary structures but nevertheless adds negligible storage to
our scheme. This auxiliary structure allows the success probability for cuckoo
hashing to be very high, which is useful in cryptographic or data-intensive

= (X_1, ..., X_p) and Y = (Y_1, ..., Y_q). They are copula based and therefore
invariant with respect to the marginal distributions of the components X_i and

In case p = q = 1 they reduce to Spearman's rho. Various properties of these

simulation. The measures are applied to characterise strength and direction of
association of bond and stock indices of five countries over time.

analyzing the dynamical properties of multi-agent strategic interactions.
Potential games are one such special but restrictive class of games that allow
for tractable dynamic analysis. Intuitively, games that are ""close"" to a
potential game should share similar properties. In this paper, we formalize and
develop this idea by quantifying to what extent the dynamic features of
potential games extend to ""near-potential"" games. We study convergence of three
commonly studied classes of adaptive dynamics: discrete-time better/best
response, logit response, and discrete-time fictitious play dynamics. For
better/best response dynamics, we focus on the evolution of the sequence of
pure strategy profiles and show that this sequence converges to a (pure)
approximate equilibrium set, whose size is a function of the ""distance"" from a
close potential game. We then study logit response dynamics and provide a
characterization of the stationary distribution of this update rule in terms of
the distance of the game from a close potential game and the corresponding
potential function. We further show that the stochastically stable strategy
profiles are pure approximate equilibria. Finally, we turn attention to
fictitious play, and establish that the sequence of empirical frequencies of
player actions converges to a neighborhood of (mixed) equilibria of the game,
where the size of the neighborhood increases with distance of the game to a
potential game. Thus, our results suggest that games that are close to a
potential game inherit the dynamical properties of potential games. Since a
close potential game to a given game can be found by solving a convex
optimization problem, our approach also provides a systematic framework for
studying convergence behavior of adaptive learning dynamics in arbitrary finite
strategic form games.

the dsDNA genome within the capsid of bacterial viruses, we study a minimal,

ends ii) the tendency of parallel-strand alignment and iii) a preference of
uniform areal density of chain segments--into a polymer nematic theory for
confined chains. Given the geometric constraints of the problem, we show that
axially symmetric packings fall into one of three topologies: the coaxial
spool; the simple solenoid; and the twisted-solenoid. Among these, only the
twisted-solenoid fills the volume without the presence of line-like
disclinations, or voids, and are therefore generically preferred in the
incompressible limit. An analysis of the thermodynamics behavior of this simple
model reveals a rich behavior, a generic sequence of phases from the empty
state for small container sizes, to the coaxial spool configuration at
intermediate sizes, ultimately giving way, via a second-order,
symmetry-breaking transition, to the twisted-solenoid structure above a

Hurricane Guillermo (1997) using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The
approach is to utilize the EnKF as a tool to only estimate the parameter values
of the model for a particular data set. The assimilation is performed using
dual-Doppler radar observations obtained during the period of rapid
intensification of Hurricane Guillermo. A unique aspect of Guillermo was that
during the period of radar observations strong convective bursts, attributable
to wind shear, formed primarily within the eastern semicircle of the eyewall.
To reproduce this observed structure within a hurricane model, background wind
shear of some magnitude must be specified; as well as turbulence and surface
parameters appropriately specified so that the impact of the shear on the
simulated hurricane vortex can be realized. To identify the complex nonlinear
interactions induced by changes in these parameters, an ensemble of model
simulations have been conducted in which individual members were formulated by
sampling the parameters within a certain range via a Latin hypercube approach.
The ensemble and the data, derived latent heat and horizontal winds from the
dual-Doppler radar observations, are utilized in the EnKF to obtain varying
estimates of the model parameters. The parameters are estimated at each time
instance, and a final parameter value is obtained by computing the average over
time. Individual simulations were conducted using the estimates, with the
simulation using latent heat parameter estimates producing the lowest overall
model forecast error.

produced rather well-collimated coherent beams in both backward and forward

approaches. The remote ASE-based lasers were shown to enable operation either
at ~391 and 337 nm using molecular nitrogen or at ~845 nm using molecular
oxygen as gain medium, depending on the employed pump lasers. To date, a
multi-wavelength laser in air that allows for dynamically switching the

Letter, we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, a harmonic-seeded

femtosecond laser pulses. Furthermore, population inversion in the
multi-wavelength remote laser occurs at an ultrafast time-scale (i.e., less

strong-field ionization of inner-valence electrons, which is fundamentally
different from the previously reported pumping mechanisms based either on
electron recombination of ionized molecular nitrogen or on resonant two-photon
excitation of atomic oxygen fragments resulting from resonant two-photon
dissociation of molecular oxygen. The bright multi-wavelength laser in air
opens the perspective for remote detection of multiple pollutants based on

Each individual is characterized by its opinions about a finite number of

Pairs of adjacent individuals interact at a rate equal to the fraction of

current models of galaxy evolution invoke very efficient supernova feedback.
This solution seems to suffer from several shortcomings however, like
predicting too little star formation in low mass galaxies at z=0. In this work,
we explore modifications to the star formation (SF) law as an alternative
solution to achieve a match to the stellar mass function. This is done by
applying semi-analytic models based on De Lucia & Blaizot, but with varying SF
laws, to the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations, within the formalism
developed by Neistein & Weinmann. Our best model includes lower SF efficiencies
than predicted by the Kennicutt-Schmidt law at low stellar masses, no sharp
threshold of cold gas mass for SF, and a SF law that is independent of cosmic
time. These simple modifications result in a model that is more successful than
current standard models in reproducing various properties of galaxies less
massive than 10^{10}Msun. The improvements include a good match to the observed
auto-correlation function of galaxies, an evolution of the stellar mass
function from z=3 to z=0 similar to observations, and a better agreement with
observed specific star formation rates. However, our modifications also lead to
a dramatic over-prediction of the cold mass content of galaxies. This shows
that finding a successful model may require fine-tuning of both star formation
and supernovae feedback, as well as improvements on gas cooling, or perhaps the
inclusion of a yet unknown process which efficiently heats or expels gas at
high redshifts.

of finite conductor. A repulsion of the critical zeros of these L-functions
away from the center of the critical strip was observed numerically by S. J.
Miller in 2006; such behaviour deviates qualitatively from the conjectural
limiting distribution of the zeros (for large conductors this distribution is
expected to approach the one-level density of eigenvalues of orthogonal
matrices after appropriate rescaling).Our purpose here is to provide a random
matrix model for Miller's surprising discovery. We consider the family of even
quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve. The main ingredient in our model is
a calculation of the eigenvalue distribution of random orthogonal matrices
whose characteristic polynomials are larger than some given value at the
symmetry point in the spectra. We call this sub-ensemble of SO(2N) the excised
orthogonal ensemble. The sieving-off of matrices with small values of the
characteristic polynomial is akin to the discretization of the central values
of L-functions implied by the formula of Waldspurger and Kohnen-Zagier.The
cut-off scale appropriate to modeling elliptic curve L-functions is
exponentially small relative to the matrix size N. The one-level density of the
excised ensemble can be expressed in terms of that of the well-known Jacobi
ensemble, enabling the former to be explicitly calculated. It exhibits an
exponentially small (on the scale of the mean spacing) hard gap determined by
the cut-off value, followed by soft repulsion on a much larger scale. Neither
of these features is present in the one-level density of SO(2N). When N tends
to infinity we recover the limiting orthogonal behaviour. Our results agree
qualitatively with Miller's discrepancy. Choosing the cut-off appropriately
gives a model in good quantitative agreement with the number-theoretical data.

Laboratory Cosmic Muons Detector. We modify the electronics and mechanics to
achieve a highly efficient gamma-ray and cosmic-ray detector. Each detector
module uses a one-inch-thick scintillator, attached to a photomultiplier tube
(PMT) and mounted on a solid aluminum frame. The detector uses scintillation to
transform passing radiation into detectable photons that are guided toward a
photocathode surface of the PMT, triggering the release of photoelectrons that
are then amplified to yield measurable electronic signals. The modules were
connected to an electronics section that compared the signals from the two PMTs
and logically determined if they were coincidence events. A data-collection
device was added for faster and prolonged count rates. A cobalt-60, which
produced two gamma rays and a beta particle has been used as a calibration
source. To investigate the isotropic behavior of radiation, two detection
modules were adjusted to different angles of rotation with respect to each
other, and the coincidence counts were measured. The coincidence counts from
the modules set at various angles were consistent throughout the angular
spectrum, and only lead shielding visibly reduced the number of counts from the
radioactive source. The inverse-square-law behavior of radiation has also been
considered. The results were such that the number of counts decreased as a
function of increasing distance from the source. Furthermore, positioning the
detector to point toward the sky in different orientations, we measured cosmic
ray muon flux as the angle from the vertical was decreased. In doing so, we
scanned different patches of the atmosphere. For the optimum operation during
the detection phase, we plateaued both PMTs to single out their best operating
gain voltage while eliminating false background noise signals.

high precision and volume galaxy surveys, in this paper we study the effects of
inhomogeneities on light propagation in a flat \Lambda CDM background. To this
end we use exact solutions of Einstein's equations (Meures & Bruni 2011) where,
starting from small fluctuations, inhomogeneities arise from a standard growing
mode and become non-linear. While the matter distribution in these models is
necessarily idealised, there is still enough freedom to assume an arbitrary
initial density profile along the line of sight. We can therefore model
over-densities and voids of various sizes and distributions, e.g. single
harmonic sinusoidal modes, coupled modes, and more general distributions in a
\Lambda CDM background. Our models allow for an exact treatment of the light
propagation problem, so that the results are unaffected by approximations and
unambiguous. Along lines of sight with density inhomogeneities which average
out on scales less than the Hubble radius, we find the distance redshift
relation to diverge negligibly from the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) result. On the contrary, if we observe along lines of sight which do not
have the same average density as the background, we find large deviations from
the FLRW distance redshift relation. Hence, a possibly large systematic might
be introduced into the analysis of cosmological observations, e.g. supernovae,
if we observe along lines of sight which are typically more or less dense than
the average density of the Universe. In turn, this could lead to wrong
parameter estimation: even if the Cosmological Principle is valid, the
identification of the true FLRW background in an inhomogeneous universe maybe
more difficult than usually assumed.

conventional opportunistic scheduling due to the absence of a central entity
that has knowledge of all the channel states. With DOS, stations contend for
the channel using random access; after a successful contention, they measure
the channel conditions and only transmit in case of a good channel, while
giving up the transmission opportunity when the channel conditions are poor.
The distributed nature of DOS systems makes them vulnerable to selfish users:
by deviating from the protocol and using more transmission opportunities, a
selfish user can gain a greater share of the wireless resources at the expense
of the well-behaved users. In this paper, we address the selfishness problem in
DOS from a game theoretic standpoint. We propose an algorithm that satisfies
the following properties: (i) when all stations implement the algorithm, the
wireless network is driven to the optimal point of operation, and (ii) one or
more selfish stations cannot gain any profit by deviating from the algorithm.
The key idea of the algorithm is to react to a selfish station by using a more
aggressive configuration that (indirectly) punishes this station. We build on
multivariable control theory to design a mechanism for punishment that on the
one hand is sufficiently severe to prevent selfish behavior while on the other
hand is light enough to guarantee that, in the absence of selfish behavior, the
system is stable and converges to the optimum point of operation. We conduct a
game theoretic analysis based on repeated games to show the algorithm's
effectiveness against selfish stations. These results are confirmed by
extensive simulations.

of spatial extremes. Several representations of max-stable random fields have
been proposed in the literature. For statistical inference it is often assumed
that there is no temporal dependence, i.e., the observations at spatial
locations are independent in time. We use two representations of stationary
max-stable spatial random fields and extend the concepts to the space-time
domain. In a first approach, we extend the idea of constructing max-stable
random fields as limits of normalized and rescaled pointwise maxima of
independent Gaussian random fields, which was introduced by Kabluchko,
Schlather and de Haan [2009], who construct max-stable random fields associated
to a class of variograms. We use a similar approach based on a well-known
result by H\""usler and Reiss and apply specific spatio-temporal covariance
models for the underlying Gaussian random field, which satisfy weak regularity
assumptions. Furthermore, we extend Smith's storm profile model to a space-time
setting and provide explicit expressions for the bivariate distribution
functions.
  The tail dependence coefficient is an important measure of extremal
dependence. We show how the spatio-temporal covariance function underlying the
Gaussian random field can be interpreted in terms of the tail dependence
coefficient. Within this context, we examine different concepts for
constructing spatio-temporal covariance models and analyse several specific
examples, including Gneiting's class of nonseparable stationary covariance

magnetic fields above 30 tesla. Here we report the observation of quantum
oscillations in URhGe revealing a tiny pocket of heavy quasiparticles that
shrinks continuously with increasing magnetic field, and finally disappears at
a topological Fermi surface transition close to or at the metamagnetic field.
The quasiparticle mass decreases and remains finite, implying that the Fermi

2.121 micron emission is observed. The line is hard to excite due to its large
excitation potential, and is most emissive in regions that have temperatures
that are nearly high enough to dissociate molecular hydrogen. I outline several
case studies. In the Helix planetary nebula strong emission is produced by
rapidly flowing molecular gas that is exposed to an intense ionizing radiation
field. This advective production of molecular hydrogen is a fundamentally
non-equilibrium process. In the filaments surrounding brightest cluster
galaxies in cool core clusters ionizing particles penetrate into magnetically
confined molecular cores and excite the gas. Finally, I outline ongoing work on
the Crab Nebula, where the first complete maps of molecular emission have only
recently been completed. Both ionizing particles and high-energy photons may be
important. Finally I speculate on the origin of the correlation between H2 / H
I intensity ratios and other properties found in Active Galaxies. This is
suggestive of a hardening of the radiation field along the Eigenvector 1
sequence. In all of this work I take the approach of understanding H2 emission

circularization. We derive approximate analytic models that describe the
evolution away from a general first order resonance that results from tidal
circularization in a two planet system and which can be shown to be a direct
consequence of the conservation of energy and angular momentum. We consider the
situation when the system is initially very close to resonance and also when
the system is between resonances. We also perform numerical simulations which
confirm these models and then apply them to two and four planet systems chosen
to have parameters related to the GJ581 and HD10180 systems. We also estimate
the tidal dissipation rates through effective quality factors that could result
in evolution to observed period ratios within the lifetimes of the systems.
Thus the survival of, or degree of departure from, close commensurabilities in

variability in transcription rate and hence has a profound effect on downstream

mitochondrial variability can sometimes dominate over other extrinsic noise
sources (such as cell cycle asynchronicity) and can significantly affect
large-scale observable properties such as cell cycle length and gene expression
levels. We also explore two recent regulatory network-based models for stem

transmitted forms a fair bit stream. However, simple source encoders such as
short Huffman codes generate bit streams that poorly match this assumption. As
a result, the channel input distribution does not match the original design
criteria. In this work, a simple method called half Huffman coding (halfHc) is
developed. halfHc transforms a Huffman code into a source code whose output is
more similar to a fair bit stream. This is achieved by permuting the codewords
such that the frequency of 1s at the output is close to 0.5. The permutations
are such that the optimality in terms of achieved compression ratio is
preserved. halfHc is applied in a practical example, and the resulting overall

coupling strength is beyond this critical value, the global attractor is a
two-dimensional disk composed of radial trajectories connecting a saddle

prove in particular non-linear stability of each synchronized equilibrium, and

K. This range includes the 15N(p,{\gamma})16O Gamow-peak energy of explosive
H-burning taking place in the external layer of a nova and the one of the hot
bottom burning (HBB) nucleosynthesis occurring in massive AGB stars. With the
present data, we are also able to confirm the result of the previous R-matrix

provide an acceptable match to the observed sample, with the log-normal
function providing statistically better agreement in general than the power-law
models. Moreover, the power-law models predict a parent population size that is
a factor of between two and ten times higher than for the log-normal models. We
note that the log-normal luminosity distribution found for the normal pulsar
population by Faucher-Gigu\`ere and Kaspi is consistent with the observed
luminosities of globular cluster pulsars. For Terzan~5, our simulations show
that the sample of detectable radio pulsars, and the diffuse radio flux
measurement, can be explained using the log-normal luminosity law with a parent
population of $\sim 150$ pulsars. Measurements of diffuse gamma-ray fluxes for
several clusters can be explained by both power-law and log-normal models, with
the log-normal distributions again providing a better match in general. In

Expansion (EPWE) reveal the presence of evanescent modes in periodic systems,

ranges of frequencies where a deaf band is traditionally predicted, an
evanescent mode with the excitable symmetry appears changing drastically the
interpretation of the transmission properties. On the other hand, the
simplicity of the sonic crystals in which only the longitudinal polarization
can be excited, is used to interpret, without loss of generality, the level
repulsion between symmetric and antisymmetric bands in sonic crystals as the
presence of an evanescent mode connecting both repelled bands. These evanescent
modes, obtained using EPWE, explain both the attenuation produced in this range
of frequencies and the transfer of symmetry from one band to the other in good
agreement with both experimental results and multiple scattering predictions.
Thus, the evanescent properties of the periodic system have been revealed

response dynamics for strategic games: at every time step a player is selected
uniformly at random and she chooses a new strategy according to a probability
distribution biased toward strategies promising higher payoffs. This process
defines an ergodic Markov chain, over the set of strategy profiles of the game,
whose unique stationary distribution is the long-term equilibrium concept for
the game. However, when the mixing time of the chain is large (e.g.,
exponential in the number of players), the stationary distribution loses its
appeal as equilibrium concept, and the transient phase of the Markov chain
becomes important. It can happen that the chain is ""metastable"", i.e., on a
time-scale shorter than the mixing time, it stays close to some probability
distribution over the state space, while in a time-scale multiple of the mixing
time it jumps from one distribution to another.

dynamics for some classes of coordination games. We first consider a pure
$n$-player coordination game that highlights the distinctive features of our
metastability notion based on distributions. Then, we study coordination games
on the clique without a risk-dominant strategy (which are equivalent to the
well-known Glauber dynamics for the Curie-Weiss model) and coordination games
on a ring (both with and without risk-dominant strategy).

the types and amounts of dust injected by AGB stars and SNae and the

C, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe in AGB stars and SNae that can be easily applied to
the gaseous ejecta, in order to determine the amount and kind of refractory
elements locally embedded into dust and injected into the ISM. The best
theoretical recipes available nowadays in literature to estimate the amount of
dust produced by SNae and AGB stars have been discussed and for SNae compared
to the observations to get clues on the problem. The condensation efficiencies
have been analyzed in the context of a classical chemical model of dust

clues coming from the observations. A new generation of dust formation models

dispersion error of the MRT-LBM. The dissipation relation precision is also
improved.And the stability of the MRT-LBM with the small bulk viscosity is
guaranteed. Von Neuman analysis of the linearized MRT-LBM is performed to
validate the optimized dispersion/dissipation relations considering
monochromatic wave solutions. Meanwhile, dispersion and dissipation errors of
the optimized MRT-LBM are quantitatively compared with the original MRT-LBM .

in this work an extension of the mass matrices so that the leptonic mixing
matrix becomes $U_{\rm PMNS}=V_L^{\ell\dagger}U_{\rm TBM}W$, where $V_L^\ell$
is a unitary matrix needed to diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix and
$W$ measures the deviation of the neutrino mixing matrix from the bimaximal
form. Hence, corrections to $U_{\rm TBM}$ arise from both charged lepton and
neutrino sectors. Following our previous work to assume a Qin-Ma-like
parametrization $V_{\rm QM}$ for the charged lepton mixing matrix $V_L^\ell$ in
which the {\it CP}-odd phase is approximately maximal, we study the
phenomenological implications in two different scenarios: $V_L^\ell=V_{\rm

preferable, though both scenarios are consistent with the data within $3\sigma$

complex objects of its kind. Our Mocassin model is composed of an extremely
dense circumstellar disk and a large pair of diffuse bipolar lobes, a
combination necessary to reproduce the observed spectrum. The masses of these
components gives a total nebular mass of 4.7Mo. Discrepancies between our model
fit and the observations are attributed to complex density inhomogeneities in
the nebula. The potential to resolve such discrepancies with more complex
models is confirmed by a range of models introducing small-scale structures.
Compared to solar abundances He is enhanced by 50%, C is slightly subsolar, O
is solar, and N is enhanced by a factor of 6. These imply a significant 3rd
dredge-up coupled with hot-bottom burning CN-cycle conversion of dredged-up C
to N.
  The central star is partly obscured by the edge-on circumstellar disk and its
properties are not well constrained. Emission from a number of high-ionization
`coronal' lines provides constraints on the form of the high-energy ionizing
flux. Using a solar abundance stellar atmosphere we are unable to fit all of
the observed line fluxes, but a substantially better fit was obtained using a
220,000K H-deficient stellar atmosphere with L*=14,300 Lo. The H-deficient
nature of the central star suggests it has undergone a late thermal pulse, and
fits to evolutionary tracks imply a central star mass of 0.73-0.82Mo.
Timescales for these tracks suggest the object left the top of the AGB ~2100
years ago, in agreement with studies of the recent mass-loss event that formed
the bipolar lobes. Based on the modelled nebular and central star masses we
estimate the initial mass of the central star to be 5.5Mo, in agreement with
that derived from evolutionary tracks.

Schr\""odinger (CCNLS) equations describing simultaneous propagation of multiple
fields in Kerr type nonlinear media. The correct bilinear equations of
$m$-CCNLS equations are obtained by using a non-standard type of Hirota's
bilinearization method and the more general bright one solitons with single
hump and double hump profiles including special flat-top profiles are obtained.
The solitons are classified as coherently coupled solitons and incoherently
coupled solitons depending upon the presence and absence of coherent
nonlinearity arising due to the existence of the co-propagating
modes/components. Further, by obtaining the more general two-soliton solutions
using this non-standard bilinearization approach we demonstrate that the
collision among coherently coupled soliton and incoherently coupled soliton
displays a non-trivial collision behaviour in which the former always undergoes
energy switching accompanied by an amplitude dependent phase-shift and change
in the relative separation distance, leaving the latter unaltered. But the
collision between coherently coupled solitons alone is found to be standard
elastic collision. Our study also reveals the important fact that the collision
between incoherently coupled solitons arising in the $m$-CCNLS system with
$m=2$ is always elastic, whereas for $m>2$ the collision becomes intricate and
for this case the $m$-CCNLS system exhibits interesting energy sharing
collision of solitons characterized by intensity redistribution, amplitude
dependent phase-shift and change in relative separation distance which is
similar to that of the multicomponent Manakov soliton collisions. This suggests
that the $m$-CCNLS system can also be a suitable candidate for soliton
collision based optical computing in addition to the Manakov system.

broadband enhanced transmission through stacked metallic multi-layers
perforated with coaxial annular apertures (CAAs). Different from previous
studies on extraordinary transmission that occurs at a single frequency, the
enhanced transmission of our system with two or three metallic layers can span
a wide frequency range with a bandwidth about 60% of the central frequency. The
phenomena arise from the excitation and hybridization of guided resonance modes
in CAAs among different layers. Measured transmission spectra are in good
agreement with calculations semi-analytically resolved by modal expansion
method.

given by a quarter of the area of its horizon. Earlier calculations in U(1)
loop quantum gravity have led to a dominant term proportional to the area, but
there was a correction involving the logarithm of the area. We find however
that SU(2) loop quantum gravity can provide an entropy that is strictly
proportional to the area as expected from black hole thermodynamics.

major Reinforcement Learning and Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms, when
using a function approximator for the value function. These divergence examples
differ from previous divergence examples in the literature, in that they are
applicable for a greedy policy, i.e. in a ""value iteration"" scenario. Perhaps
surprisingly, with a greedy policy, it is also possible to get divergence for
the algorithms TD(1) and Sarsa(1). In addition to these divergences, we also
achieve divergence for the Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms HDP, DHP and
GDHP.

"1107.5077","Ronald Adler","Ronald J. Adler","Genesis and the tipping pencil; why the Universe is flat","8 pages, 1 figure",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a room with five cosmologists there there may easily be ten theories of
cosmogenesis. Cosmogenesis is a popular topic for speculation because it is
philosophically deep and because such speculations are unlikely to be proven
wrong in the near future. The scenario we present here was intended mainly as a
pedagogical illustration or toy model, but it turns out to possibly have a more
serious and interesting result - a rationale for the spatial flatness of the
Universe. Our basic assumptions are that the cosmological scale factor obeys
the standard Friedman equation of general relativistic cosmology and that the
equation is dominated by a cosmological constant term and a curvature term; the
dynamics of the Universe is then (approximately) the same as that of a tipping
pencil. The scale factor cannot remain at an unstable initial value of zero and
must increase (i.e. the Universe must come into existence) according to the
uncertainty principle, that is due to quantum fluctuations; in other words we
propose in a precise but limited context an answer to Heidegger's famous
question ""Why is there something rather than nothing."" The mechanism is the
same as that whereby an idealized pencil balanced on its point cannot remain so
and must tip over. If it is moreover assumed that the Universe expands at the
minimum asymptotic rate consistent with the uncertainty principle then the
result is spatial flatness.
