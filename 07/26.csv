presently represents the best description of gravitation. It is however
challenged by observations at very large length scales, and already at the
solar system scale, tracking of the Pioneer 10/11 probes has failed to confirm
their expected behavior according to GR. Metric extensions of GR, which are
presented here, have the quality of preserving the fundamental properties of GR
while introducing scale dependent modifications. We show that they moreover
represent an appropriate family of gravitation theories to be compared with
observations when analysing gravity tests. We also discuss different tests
which could allow one to determine the metric extension of GR prevailing in the
solar system.

polydispersity can be challenging to characterize from optical microscopy or
computer simulation data due to inadequate sampling. As a result, it is common
to adopt an effective one-component description of the structure that ignores
the differences between particle types. Unfortunately, whether this kind of
simplified description preserves or averages out information important for
understanding the behavior of the fluid depends on the degree of polydispersity
and can be difficult to assess, especially when the corresponding
multicomponent description of the pair correlations is unavailable for
comparison. Here, we present a computer simulation study that examines the
implications of adopting an effective one-component structural description of a
polydisperse fluid. The square-well model that we investigate mimics key
aspects of the experimental behavior of suspended colloids with short-range,
polymer-mediated attractions. To characterize the partial pair-correlation
functions and thermodynamic excess entropy of this system, we introduce a Monte
Carlo sampling strategy appropriate for fluids with a large number of
pseudo-components. The data from our simulations at high particle
concentrations, as well as exact theoretical results for dilute systems, show
how qualitatively different trends between structural order and particle
attractions emerge from the multicomponent and effective one-component
treatments, even with systems characterized by moderate polydispersity. We
examine consequences of these differences for excess-entropy based scalings of
shear viscosity, and we discuss how use of the multicomponent treatment reveals
similarities between the corresponding dynamic scaling behaviors of attractive
colloids and liquid water that the effective one-component analysis does not

networks (GRN) from temporal expression profiles. In general, the main
limitations faced by GRN inference methods is the small number of samples with
huge dimensionalities and the noisy nature of the expression measurements. In
face of these limitations, alternatives are needed to get better accuracy on
the GRNs inference problem. This work addresses this problem by presenting an
alternative feature selection method that applies prior knowledge on its search
strategy, called SFFS-BA. The proposed search strategy is based on the
Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) algorithm, with the inclusion of a
scale-free (Barab\'asi-Albert) topology information in order to guide the
search process to improve inference. The proposed algorithm explores the
scale-free property by pruning the search space and using a power law as a
weight for reducing it. In this way, the search space traversed by the SFFS-BA
method combines a breadth-first search when the number of combinations is small
(<k> <= 2) with a depth-first search when the number of combinations becomes
explosive (<k> >= 3), being guided by the scale-free prior information.
Experimental results show that the SFFS-BA provides a better inference
similarities than SFS and SFFS, keeping the robustness of the SFS and SFFS
methods, thus presenting very good results.

intermediate O2 If*/WN6 spectral type. Based on a mosaic made from the 3.6

we studied the spatial location of the new emission line stars, finding that

generically misaligned with respect to the SM fermion mass matrices. The
presence of the fourth family typically enhances the misalignment effects and
we show that one should expect them to be highly non-symmetrical in the

known experimental precision measurements such as the oblique parameters and
$Z\to b {\bar b}$ or $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$. On the other hand, $\Delta F=1,2$
processes, mediated by tree-level Higgs exchange, as well as radiative
corrections to $b \to s \gamma$ and $\mu \to e\gamma$ put some generic pressure
on the allowed size of the flavor violating couplings. But more importantly,
these couplings will alter the Higgs decay patterns as well as those of the new

phenomenology in high energy colliders. These might become very important
indirect signals for these type of models as they would be present even when

nanoparticle incorporated into a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) as a function
of applied magnetic field, voltage V (-0.38 V < V < +0.26 V), and temperatures
(283 K< T< 363 K) . By analyzing the results within the framework of a modified
N\'eel-Brown formalism we determine the effective attempt time of the
nanoparticle and also the bias dependences of the in-plane and out-of-plane
spin torques. There is a significant linear modification of the effective
temperature with voltage due to the in-plane torque and a significant
contribution of a ""field like"" torque that is quadratic with voltage. The
methods presented here do not require complicated models for device heating or
calibration procedures, but instead directly measure how temperature, field,
and voltage influence the energy landscape and thermal fluctuations of a
two-state system. These results should have significant implications for
designs of future nanometer-scale magnetic random access memory elements and
provide a straightforward methodology to determine these parameters in other
MTJ device structures.

quantum mechanics. Unlike the toy-models previously studied in the literature,
our toy-model allows for an observer to have a full knowledge of a system's
real (ontic) state. This is achieved by introducing domains of disjointness,
that is by allowing ontic states to be ""non-orthogonal"". The observer can
perform tests which allow her to distinguish between the states in a single
domain of disjointness, but not between all ontic states at once. The
consequence of this assumption is that the ontic picture is extended to include
joint states of two or more systems. This effectively amounts to emergence of
entanglement in the model. We argue that these features, albeit being a
""non-classical"" element in the theory, support the view that quantum-mechanical
states are ontic states.

a manifold with boundary. In such a field theory, gauge invariance implies the
presence of anomalous chiral modes localized on the edge of the sample. We
assume a simple boundary structure, i.e., the absence of a reconstructed edge.
For the bulk, we consider a multiply connected planar geometry. We study
tunneling processes between two boundary components of the fluid and calculate
the tunneling current to lowest order in perturbation theory as a function of
dc bias voltage. Particular attention is paid to the special cases when the
edge modes propagate at the same speed, and when they exhibit two significantly
distinct propagation speeds. We distinguish between two ""geometries"" of
interference contours corresponding to the (electronic) Fabry-Perot and

in the current is absent when exactly one hole in the fluid corresponding to
one of the two edge components involved in the tunneling processes lies inside

limitations of traditional Prolog systems in dealing with recursion and
redundant sub-computations. We can distinguish two main categories of tabling
mechanisms: suspension-based tabling and linear tabling. While suspension-based
mechanisms are considered to obtain better results in general, they have more
memory space requirements and are more complex and harder to implement than
linear tabling mechanisms. Arguably, the SLDT and DRA strategies are the two
most successful extensions to standard linear tabled evaluation. In this work,
we propose a new strategy, named DRS, and we present a framework, on top of the
Yap system, that supports the combination of all these three strategies. Our
implementation shares the underlying execution environment and most of the data
structures used to implement tabling in Yap. We thus argue that all these
common features allows us to make a first and fair comparison between these
different linear tabling strategies and, therefore, better understand the
advantages and weaknesses of each, when used solely or combined with the
others.

counterparts to the eight transient sources without optical counterparts, and
the two transient sources with optical counterparts seen by Bower et al.
Neither of the sources with optical counterparts was detected in X-rays. One of
the eight optical non-detections is associated with a marginal (2.4 sigma)
X-ray detection in our Chandra image. A second optically-undetected Bower et

galaxy, or alternatively is undetected in X-rays and is a chance association
with the nearby X-ray source. The X-ray flux upper limits, and the one marginal
detection, are consistent with the interpretation of Ofek et al. that the
optically-undetected radio transients are flares from isolated old Galactic
neutron stars. The marginal X-ray detection has a hardness ratio which implies
a temperature too high for a simple one-temperature neutron star model, but
plausible multi-component fits are not excluded, and in any case the marginal
X-ray detection may be due to cosmic rays or particle background. The X-ray

multi-fractional scenario inspired by multi-fractal geometry, where the
dimension changes with the scale. This is related to the renormalization group
properties of fractional field theories, illustrated by the example of a scalar
field. Depending on the symmetries of the Lagrangian, one can define two
models. In one of them, the effective dimension flows from 2 in the ultraviolet
(UV) and geometry constrains the infrared limit to be four-dimensional. At the
UV critical value, the model is rendered power-counting renormalizable.
However, this is not the most fundamental regime. Compelling arguments of
fractal geometry require an extension of the fractional action measure to
complex order. In doing so, we obtain a hierarchy of scales characterizing
different geometric regimes. At very small scales, discrete symmetries emerge
and the notion of a continuous spacetime begins to blur, until one reaches a
fundamental scale and an ultra-microscopic fractal structure. This fine
hierarchy of geometries has implications for non-commutative theories and
discrete quantum gravity. In the latter case, the present model can be viewed
as a top-down realization of a quantum-discrete to classical-continuum
transition.

This transient was missed by galaxy-targeted surveys and was only found in
archival optical images obtained by CRTS and ASAS. It was detected shortly
after explosion and reached a bright optical maximum, Vmax = 13.6 mag (M_Vmax ~
-16.5). The shape of the light curve shows a plateau of 100 days, followed by a
drop of 1.4 mag in V-band to a decline with the approximate Co 56 decay slope,
consistent with 0.04 Msun of Ni 56 synthesized in the explosion. A spectrum
obtained 2 years after explosion shows a broad, boxy Halpha emission line,
which is unusual for type IIP supernovae. We detect the supernova in archival
Spitzer and WISE images obtained 8-14 months after explosion, which show clear
signs of warm dust emission. The dwarf irregular host galaxy has a low
gas-phase oxygen abundance, 12 + log(O/H) = 8.2 (~1/5 Solar), similar to those
of the SMC and the hosts of long gamma-ray bursts and luminous core-collapse
supernovae. We study the host environment using GALEX FUV, R-band, and Halpha
images and find that the supernova occurred in a large star-formation complex.
The morphology of the Halpha emission appears as a large shell (R = 350 pc)
surrounding the FUV and optical emission. We estimate an age of ~9 Myr and a
total mass of ~2 x 10^5 Msun for the star-formation complex. These properties
are consistent with the expanding Halpha supershells observed in well-studied
nearby dwarf galaxies, which are tell-tale signs of feedback from the
cumulative effect of massive star winds and supernovae. The age estimated for
the star-forming region suggests a relatively high-mass progenitor star with
initial mass of ~20 Msun. We discuss the implications of these findings in the
study of core-collapse supernova progenitors. (Abridged)

visible portion of the stream is 18 degrees long, lying roughly in the Galactic
Anticenter direction and extending from Hydra to Cancer. At an estimated
distance of 9.7 kpc, the stream is approximately 170 pc across on the sky. The
curvature of the stream implies a fairly eccentric box orbit that passes close
to both the Galactic center and to the sun, making it dynamically distinct from
the nearby Monoceros, Anticenter, and GD-1 streams. Within the stream is a
relatively strong, 2 degree-wide concentration of stars with a very similar
color-magnitude distribution that we designate Hydra I. Given its prominence
within the stream and its unusual morphology, we suggest that Hydra I is the
last vestige of the EBS's progenitor, possibly already unbound or in the final
throes of tidal dissolution. Though both Hydra I and the EBS have a relatively
high velocity dispersion, given the comparatively narrow width of the stream
and the high frequency of encounters with the bulge and massive constituents of
the disk that such an eccentric orbit would entail, we suggest that the
progenitor was likely a globular cluster, and that both it and the stream have
undergone significant heating over time.

the influence of baryonic processes and find that they leave a twofold effect
on the relation between the peak of the rotation curve and its position (Vmax
and Rmax). Satellites with a large baryon fraction experience adiabatic
contraction thus decreasing Rmax while leaving Vmax more or less unchanged.
Subhaloes with smaller baryon fractions undergo a decrease in Vmax possibly due
to outflows of material. Furthermore, the situation of finding subhaloes in
simulations that lie outside the confidence interval for possible hosts of the
bright MW dwarf spheroidals, appears to be far more prominent in cosmologies
with a high sigma8 normalisation and depends on the mass of the host. We
conclude that the problem cannot be simply solved by including baryonic
processes and hence demands further investigations.

larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias.
However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy
properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the
SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into
those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as
satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star
formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of
galaxies, f_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes,
there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f_q and rho. We use the
group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central
and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more
likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f_q-rho correlation
is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment,
which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass
central galaxies (Mgal <~ 10^10.0 Msol/h^2), there is no correlation between
f_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of
dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all
correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution
N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central
galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low
mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the
star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation
histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in
old halos. (Abridged)

isocurvature fluctuations between photons and non-relativistic particles to be
sub-dominant to adiabatic fluctuations. Perturbations in the relative number
densities of baryons and dark matter, however, are surprisingly poorly
constrained. In fact, baryon-density perturbations of fairly large amplitude
may exist if they are compensated by dark-matter perturbations, so that the
total density remains unchanged. These compensated isocurvature perturbations
(CIPs) leave no imprint on the CMB at observable scales, at linear order in
their amplitude. B modes in the CMB polarization are generated at reionization
through the modulation of the optical depth by CIPs, but this induced
polarization is small. The strongest known constraint $\lesssim 10%$ to the CIP
amplitude comes from galaxy cluster baryon fractions. Here it is shown that
modulation of the baryon density by the CIP at and before the decoupling of
Thomson scattering at $z\sim 1100$ gives rise to CMB effects several orders of
magnitude larger than those considered before. Polarization B modes are
induced, as are correlations between temperature/polarization
spherical-harmonic coefficients of different $lm$. It is shown that the CIP
field at the surface of last scatter can be measured with these higher-order
correlations. The sensitivity of ongoing and future experiments to these
fluctuations is estimated. Data from the WMAP, ACT, SPT, and Spider experiments
will be sensitive to fluctuations with amplitude $\sim 5-10%$. The Planck
satellite and Polarbear experiment will be sensitive to fluctuations with
amplitude $\sim 3%$. SPTPol, ACTPol, and future space-based polarization
methods will probe amplitudes as low as $\sim 0.4%-0.6%$. In the cosmic
variance limit, the lowest amplitude CIPs that could be detected with the CMB

cancellations occur in the spin-independent elastic neutralino-quark scattering
cross section, but do not impose any relations among the weak-scale MSSM
parameters. We show that direct detection cross section below 10^-44 cm^2
requires the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) neutralino to be close to
either a pure gaugino or pure Higgsino limit, with smaller cross sections
correlated with smaller admixture of the subdominant components. The current
XENON100 bound rules out essentially all models in which the lightest
neutralino has the Higgsino fraction between 0.2 and 0.8. Furthermore, smaller
direct detection cross sections correlate with stronger fine-tuning in the
electroweak symmetry breaking sector. In the gaugino LSP scenario, the current
XENON100 bound already implies some fine-tuning: for example, at least 10%
tuning is required if the LSP mass is above 70 GeV. In both gaugino and
Higgsino LSP scenarios, the direct dark matter searches currently being
conducted and designed should lead to a discovery if no accidental
cancellations or fine-tuning at a level below 1% is present.

is a very sensitive probe of the cosmic background evolution and of the growth
history of density perturbations, and could provide a powerful tool to
distinguish between a cosmological constant and a dynamical dark energy field.
In particular, the recent detection of very massive clusters of galaxies at
high redshifts has attracted significant interest as a possible indication of a
failure of the standard LCDM model. Several attempts have been made in order to
explain such detections in the context of non-Gaussian scenarios or interacting
dark energy models, showing that both these alternative cosmologies predict an
enhanced number density of massive clusters at high redshifts, possibly
alleviating the tension. However, all the models proposed so far also
overpredict the abundance of massive clusters at the present epoch, and are
therefore in contrast with observational bounds on the low-redshift halo mass
function. In this paper we present for the first time a new class of
interacting dark energy models that simultaneously account for an enhanced
number density of massive clusters at high redshifts and for both the standard
cluster abundance at the present time and the standard power spectrum
normalization at CMB. The key feature of this new class of models is the
""bounce"" of the dark energy scalar field on the cosmological constant barrier
at relatively recent epochs. We present the background and linear perturbations
evolution of the model, showing that the standard amplitude of density
perturbations is recovered both at CMB and at the present time, and we
demonstrate by means of large N-body simulations that our scenario predicts an
enhanced number of massive clusters at high redshifts without affecting the
present halo abundance. (Abridged)

physics. Many applications, including quantum information processing, depend on
understanding it; and fundamental theories going beyond quantum mechanics have
been suggested [1-3], where the breakdown of quantum theory appears as an
'intrinsic decoherence', mimicking environmental decoherence [4]. Such theories
cannot be tested until we have a handle on ordinary environmental decoherence
processes. Here we show that the theory for insulating electronic spin systems
can make accurate predictions for environmental decoherence in molecular-based
quantum magnets [5]. Experimental understanding of decoherence in molecular
magnets has been limited by short decoherence times, which make coherent spin
manipulation extremely difficult [6-9]. Here we reduce the decoherence by
applying a strong magnetic field. The theory predicts the contributions to the
decoherence from phonons, nuclear spins, and intermolecular dipolar
interactions, for a single crystal of the Fe8 molecular magnet. In experiments
we find that the decoherence time varies strongly as a function of temperature
and magnetic field. The theoretical predictions are fully verified
experimentally - there are no other visible decoherence sources. Our
investigation suggests that the decoherence time is ultimately limited by
nuclear spins, and can be extended up to about 500 microseconds, by optimizing
the temperature, magnetic field, and nuclear isotopic concentrations.

galaxies (ETG) within the hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM scenario, that is based on
the assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in ETGs is a proxy for
the specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_R$. Within our model we
reproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude in
the \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating ETGs have at least 10% of their
total stellar mass in a disc component. In agreement with \atl observations we
find that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ M_* > 10^{10.5}$
M$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall ETG population. We show in
detail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,
supporting the classification of ETGs into these two categories. Slow rotators
accrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and their
most massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during their
evolution. Fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on average
less than one major merger in their past.
  We find that the underlying physical reason for the different growth
histories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas cooling
in massive galaxies. Once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,
galaxies grow via infall from satellites. Frequent minor mergers thereby,
destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lower
the specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_R$
into the slow rotator regime. Abridged...

matches the spectral energy distribution and spatially resolved millimeter dust
continuum emission. Then, we refine the vertical structure of the model using
wide range of excitation conditions sampled by the CO lines, in particular the
rarely observed J=6--5 transition. By fitting 13CO data in this structure, we
further constrain the vertical distribution of CO to lie between a lower
boundary below which CO freezes out onto dust grains (T ~ 19 K) and an upper
boundary above which CO can be photodissociated (the hydrogen column density
from the disk surface is ~ 10^{21} cm-2). The freeze-out at 19 K leads to a
significant drop in the gas-phase CO column density beyond a radius of ~155 AU,
a ""CO snow line"" that we directly resolve. By fitting the abundances of all CO

An aircraft
(fighter) equipped with $n$ anti-aircraft missiles is intercepted by enemy
airplanes, the appearance of which follows a homogeneous Poisson process with
known intensity. If $j$ of the $n$ missiles are spent at an encounter they
destroy an enemy plane with probability $a(j)$, where $a(0) = 0 $ and
$\{a(j)\}$ is a known, strictly increasing concave sequence, e.g., $a(j) =
1-q^j, \; \, 0 < q < 1$. If the enemy is not destroyed, the enemy shoots the
fighter down with known probability $1-u$, where $0 \le u \le 1$. The goal of
the fighter is to shoot down as many enemy airplanes as possible during a given
time period $[0, T]$. Let $K (n, t)$ be the smallest optimal number of missiles
to be used at a present encounter, when the fighter has flying time $t$
remaining and $n$ missiles remaining. Three seemingly obvious properties of
$K(n, t)$ have been conjectured: [A] The closer to the destination, the more of
the $n$ missiles one should use, [B] the more missiles one has, the more one
should use, and [C] the more missiles one has, the more one should save for
possible future encounters. We show that [C] holds for all $0 \le u \le 1$,
that [A] and [B] hold for the ""Invincible Fighter"" ($u=1$), and that [A] holds
but [B] fails for the ""Frail Fighter"" ($u=0$), the latter through a surprising

Relativity, at least if matter obeys the strong energy condition rho + 3p > 0.
However quantum vacuum fluctuations generally violate this condition, as does
the eq. of state of cosmological dark energy. When quantum effects are
considered, black holes lead to a number of thermodynamic paradoxes associated
with the Hawking temperature and assumption of black hole entropy, which are
briefly reviewed. It is argued that the largest quantum effects arise from the
conformal scalar degrees of freedom generated by the trace anomaly of the
stress-energy tensor in curved space. At event horizons these can have
macroscopically large backreaction effects on the geometry, potentially
removing the classical event horizon of black hole and cosmological spacetimes,
replacing them with a quantum phase boundary layer, where the effective value
of the gravitational vacuum energy density can change. In the effective theory
including the quantum effects of the anomaly, the cosmological term becomes a
dynamical condensate, whose value depends upon boundary conditions at the
horizon. By taking a positive value in the interior of a fully collapsed star,
the effective cosmological term removes any singularity, replacing it with a
smooth dark energy de Sitter interior. The resulting gravitational vacuum
condensate star (or gravastar) configuration resolves all black hole paradoxes,
and provides a testable alternative to black holes as the final quantum
mechanical end state of complete gravitational collapse. The observed dark
energy of our universe likewise may be a macroscopic finite size effect whose
value depends not on Planck scale or other microphysics but on the cosmological
Hubble horizon scale itself.

heavily used techniques for analyzing the differences between nucleic acid
sequence samples sampled from a given environment. However, a classical
application of these techniques to distances computed between samples can lack
transparency because there is no ready interpretation of the axes of classical
PCA plots, and it is difficult to assign any clear intuitive meaning to either
the internal nodes or the edge lengths of trees produced by distance-based
hierarchical clustering methods such as UPGMA. We show that more interesting
and interpretable results are produced by two new methods that leverage the
special structure of phylogenetic placement data. Edge principal components
analysis enables the detection of important differences between samples that
contain closely related taxa. Each principal component axis is simply a
collection of signed weights on the edges of the phylogenetic tree, and these
weights are easily visualized by a suitable thickening and coloring of the
edges. Squash clustering outputs a (rooted) clustering tree in which each
internal node corresponds to an appropriate ""average"" of the original samples
at the leaves below the node. Moreover, the length of an edge is a suitably
defined distance between the averaged samples associated with the two incident
nodes, rather than the less interpretable average of distances produced by
UPGMA. We present these methods and illustrate their use with data from the
microbiome of the human vagina.

of freedom of quantum gravity. This idea can be made precise in AdS_3, where
the the stringy or gravitational exclusion principle asserts that certain
perturbative excitations are not present in the exact quantum spectrum. We show
that this effect is visible directly in the bulk gravity theory: the norm of
the offending linearized state is zero or negative. When the norm is negative,
the theory is signaling its own breakdown as an effective field theory; this
provides a perturbative bulk explanation for the stringy exclusion principle.
When the norm vanishes the bulk state is null rather than physical. This
implies that certain non-trivial diffeomorphisms must be regarded as gauge
symmetries rather than spectrum-generating elements of the asymptotic symmetry
group. This leads to subtle effects in the computation of one-loop determinants
for Einstein gravity, higher spin theories and topologically massive gravity in
AdS_3. In particular, heat kernel methods do not capture the correct spectrum

with the observations. Two other observations support this picture: an inverse
correlation between the flux in the power-law spectral component and the fitted
inner disk temperature, and a near-constant total photon flux, suggesting that
the inner disk is not ejected when a lower temperature is observed.

evidence that the blazar sequence is formed from two populations in the
synchrotron {\nu}peak - Lpeak plane, each forming an upper edge to an envelope
of progressively misaligned blazars, and connecting to an adjacent group of
radio galaxies having jets viewed at much larger angles to the line of sight.
When binned by jet kinetic power (Lkin; as measured through a scaling
relationship with extended radio power), we find that radio core dominance
decreases with decreasing synchrotron Lpeak, revealing that sources in the
envelope are generally more misaligned. We find population-based evidence of
velocity gradients in jets at low kinetic powers (~ 10^42-10^44.5 erg/s),
corresponding to FR I radio galaxies and most BL Lacs. These low jet power
'weak jet' sources, thought to exhibit radiatively inefficient accretion, are
distinguished from the population of non-decelerating, low synchrotron-peaking
(LSP) blazars and FR II radio galaxies ('strong' jets) which are thought to
exhibit radiatively efficient accretion. The two-population interpretation
explains the apparent contradiction of the existence of highly core-dominated,
low-power blazars at both low and high synchrotron peak frequencies, and
further implies that most intermediate synchrotron peak (ISP) sources are not
intermediate in intrinsic jet power between LSP and high synchrotron-peaking

networks, protein interactions in biological networks, and Internet traffic

Most of these applications rely on computing distances between node pairs,
which for large graphs can take minutes to compute using traditional algorithms
such as breadth-first-search (BFS). In this paper, we study ways to enable
scalable graph processing on today's massive graphs. We explore the design
space of graph coordinate systems, a new approach that accurately approximates
node distances in constant time by embedding graphs into coordinate spaces. We
show that a hyperbolic embedding produces relatively low distortion error, and
propose Rigel, a hyperbolic graph coordinate system that lends itself to
efficient parallelization across a compute cluster. Rigel produces
significantly more accurate results than prior systems, and is naturally
parallelizable across compute clusters, allowing it to provide accurate results
for graphs up to 43 million nodes. Finally, we show that Rigel's functionality
can be easily extended to locate (near-) shortest paths between node pairs.
After a one- time preprocessing cost, Rigel answers node-distance queries in
10's of microseconds, and also produces shortest path results up to 18 times
faster than prior shortest-path systems with similar levels of accuracy.

Delta=500, 1000, and 2500 rho_c, are consistent in slope and normalization with
previous results derived under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE).
We find an intrinsic scatter in M_wl at fixed Y_sph of 20%, larger than both
previous measurements of M_HSE-Y_sph scatter as well as the scatter in true
mass at fixed Y_sph found in simulations. Moreover, the scatter in our
lensing-based scaling relations is morphology dependent, with 30-40% larger
M_wl for undisturbed compared to disturbed clusters at the same Y_sph at r_500.
Further examination suggests that the segregation may be explained by the
inability of our spherical lens models to faithfully describe the
three-dimensional structure of the clusters, in particular, the structure along
the line-of-sight. We find that the ellipticity of the brightest cluster
galaxy, a proxy for halo orientation, correlates well with the offset in mass
from the mean scaling relation, which supports this picture. This provides
empirical evidence that line-of-sight projection effects are an important
systematic uncertainty in lensing-based scaling relations.

parsec-scale structures were revealed for three out of the five sources with

nonthermal jets. FBQS J1644+2619 with an inverted spectrum showed a prominent
one-sided linear structure, indicating Doppler beaming with an intrinsic jet
speed of >0.74c. FBQS J1629+4007, also with an inverted spectrum, showed rapid
flux variability, indicating Doppler beaming with an intrinsic jet speed of
>0.88c. Thus, we found convincing evidence that these two NLS1s can generate at
least mildly or highly relativistic jets, which may make them apparently radio
loud even if they are intrinsically radio quiet. On the other hand, the other
three NLS1s had steep spectra and two of them showed significantly diffuse
pc-scale structures, which were unlikely to be strongly beamed. Thus, some
NLS1s have the ability to generate jets strong enough to make them
intrinsically radio loud without Doppler beaming. NLS1s as a class show a
number of extreme properties and radio-loud ones are very rare. We build on
these radio results to understand that the central engines of radio-loud NLS1s
are essentially the same as that of other radio-loud AGNs in terms of the
formation of nonthermal jets.

addressed in the context of the Euler equation for an incompressible inviscid

constitute the center of the Lie-Poisson algebra underlying the Hamiltonian
formulation, and this leads to a study of the symplectic operator defining the
Poisson bracket. The kernel of the symplectic operator, for this typical
example of an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system for media in terms of
Eulerian variables, is analyzed. For two-dimensional flows, a rigorously
solvable system is formulated. The nonlinearity of the Euler equation makes the
symplectic operator inhomogeneous on phase space (the function space of the
state variable), and it is seen that this creates a singularity where the
nullity of the symplectic operator (the ""dimension"" of the center) changes.
Singular Casimir elements stemming from this singularity are unearthed using a
generalization of the functional derivative that occurs in the Poisson bracket.

may be achieved by specific and non-specific interactions, and typically
requires the clustering of many adhesion bonds into ""adhesion domains"". One
potential mediator of the early stages of the aggregation process is the
Casimir-type forces between adhesion sites induced by the membrane thermal
fluctuations. In this review, I will present a theoretical analysis of
fluctuation induced aggregation of adhesion sites in supported membranes. I
will first discuss the influence of a single attachment point on the spectrum
of membrane thermal fluctuations, from which the free energy cost of the
attachment point will be deduced. I will then analyze the problem of a
supported membrane with two adhesion points. Using scaling arguments and Monte
Carlo simulations, I will demonstrate that two adhesion points attract each
other via an infinitely long range effective potential that grows
logarithmically with the pair distance. Finally, I will discuss the many-body
nature of the fluctuation induced interactions. I will show that while these
interactions alone are not sufficient to allow the formation of aggregation
clusters, they greatly reduce the strength of the residual interactions
required to facilitate cluster formation. Specifically, for adhesion molecules
interacting via a short range attractive potential, the strength of the direct
interactions required for aggregation is reduced by about a factor of two to
below the thermal energy $k_BT$.

A network of coupled neurons, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), serves as a
robust self-sustained circadian pacemaker. Synchronization of this timer to the
environmental light-dark cycle is crucial for an organism's fitness. In a
recent theoretical and experimental study it was shown that coupling governs
the entrainment range of circadian clocks. We apply the theory of coupled
oscillators to analyse how diffusive and mean-field coupling affects the
entrainment range of interacting cells. Mean-field coupling leads to amplitude
expansion of weak oscillators and, as a result, reduces the entrainment range.
We also show that coupling determines the rigidity of the synchronized SCN
network, i.e. the relaxation rates upon perturbation. %(Floquet exponents). Our
simulations and analytical calculations using generic oscillator models help to
elucidate how coupling determines the entrainment of the SCN. Our theoretical
framework helps to interpret experimental data.

National Laboratory have revealed strong modification of the jet structure in

hard scattered partons with the hot and dense QCD matter. The study of
heavy-quark (charm and bottom) production in such collisions provides key tests
of parton energy-loss models and, thus, yields profound insight into the
properties of the produced matter. The high-pT yield of heavy-flavor decay
electrons exhibits an unexpected large suppression. Since those single
electrons have contributions from charm and bottom decays an experimental
method is needed to investigate them separately. Heavy-flavor particle
correlations provide information about the underlying production mechanism. In
this contribution, a review on recent measurements on azimuthal correlations of
single electrons and open charmed mesons at RHIC and perspectives of such
measurements at the CERN-Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented. Moreover,
it has been shown that next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD processes, such as gluon

research studies the time-frequency properties of the superorbital modulation
of SMC X-1 based on the observations made by the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) onboard
the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE).We analyzed the entire ASM database
collected since 1996. The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), developed for
non-stationary and nonlinear time series analysis, was adopted to derive the
instantaneous superorbital frequency. The resultant Hilbert spectrum is
consistent with the dynamic power spectrum while it shows more detailed
information in both the time and frequency domains. The RXTE observations
manifest that the superorbital modulation period was mostly betweenn ~50 d and
~65 d, whenas it changed to ~45 d around MJD 50,800 and MJD 54,000. Our
analysis further indicates that the instantaneous frequency changed in a time
scale of hundreds of days between ~MJD 51,500 and ~MJD 53,500. Based on the
instantaneous phase defined by HHT, we folded the ASM light curve to derive a
superorbital profile, from which an asymmetric feature and a low state with
barely any X-ray emissions (lasting for ~0.3 cycles) were observed. We also
calculated the correlation between the mean period and the amplitude of the
superorbital modulation. The result is similar to the recently discovered
relationship between the superorbital cycle length and the mean X-ray flux for

charged surfactants was investigated by light scattering experiments and by
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The copolymer was poly(sodium
acrylate)-b-poly(acrylamide) and the surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (DTAB). In a previous report, we had shown that the copolymers and the
surfactants co-assembled spontaneously into colloidal complexes. Depending of
the charge ratio Z = [DTA+]/[COO-], the complexes were either single surfactant
micelles decorated by copolymers, or core-shell hierarchical structures. ITC
was performed in order to investigate the thermodynamics of the complex
formation. Titrations of copolymers by surfactants and of surfactants by
copolymers revealed that the electrostatic co-assembly was an endothermic
reaction, suggesting a process dominated by the entropy of the counterions.
Here we found that the thermodynamic quantities associated with the reaction
depended on the mixing order. When surfactants were added stepwise to
copolymers, the titration was associated with the formation of single micelles
decorated by a unique polymer. Above a critical charge ratio, the micelles
rearranged themselves into 100 nm colloidal complexes in a collective process
which displayed the following features : i) the process was very slow as
compared to the timescale of Brownian diffusion, ii) the thermodynamic
signature was a endothermic peak and iii) the stoichiometry between the
positive and negative charges was modified from n = 0.48 (single micelles) to
0.75 (core-shell complexes). The amount of polyelectrolytes needed for the
complex formation exceeded the number required to compensate the net micellar
charge, confirming the evidence of overcharging in the complex formation.

nature of the maser emission in some NLS1s where water maser emission has been
detected. We observed a sample of NLS1 galaxies with the Green Bank Telescope
in a search for water maser emission at 22 GHz. We also reduced and analysed
archival Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array data and produced 22-GHz
spectra for the five NLS1 galaxies with detected maser emission. In particular,
we imaged the maser and nuclear radio continuum of NGC5506 at subarcsec scales
with the Very Large Array. We discovered maser emission in two NLS1 galaxies:
IGRJ16385-2057, and IRAS03450+0055. In addition to the three previously known
maser detections in the NLS1s Mrk766, NGC4051, and NGC5506, this yields a water
maser detection rate in NLS1 galaxies of ~7% (5/71). This value rises
significantly to ~21% (5/24) when considering only NLS1 galaxies at recessional
velocities less than 10000 km/s. For NGC4051 and NGC5506, we find that the
water maser emission is located within 5 and 12 pc, respectively, of nuclear
radio continuum knots, which are interpreted as core-jet structures.

two ways. First, the position detection probabilities of particles described by
a non-Gaussian wave-packet projected upwards against gravity around the
classical turning point and also around the point of initial projection are
calculated. These probabilities exhibit mass-dependence at both these points,
thereby reflecting the quantum violation of the weak equivalence principle.
Secondly, the mean arrival time of freely falling particles is calculated using
the quantum probability current, which also turns out to be mass dependent.
Such a mass-dependence is shown to be enhanced by increasing the
non-Gaussianity parameter of the wave packet, thus signifying a stronger
violation of the weak equivalence principle through a greater departure from
Gaussianity of the initial wave packet. The mass-dependence of both the
position detection probabilities and the mean arrival time vanish in the limit
of large mass. Thus, compatibility between the weak equivalence principle and
quantum mechanics is recovered in the macroscopic limit of the latter. A
selection of Bohm trajectories is exhibited to illustrate these features in the
free fall case.

simply discarded to avoid lengthscales which are difficult to model
theoretically. We introduce a new technique which enables the extraction of
useful information from the bispectrum of galaxies well beyond the conventional
limits of perturbation theory. Our results strongly suggest that this method
increases the range of scales where the relation between the bispectrum and
power spectrum in tree-level perturbation theory may be applied, from k_max ~
0.1 h/Mpc to ~ 0.7 h/Mpc. This leads to correspondingly large improvements in
the determination of galaxy bias. Since the clipped matter power spectrum
closely follows the linear power spectrum, there is the potential to use this
technique to probe the growth rate of linear perturbations and confront
theories of modified gravity with observation.

transfers mass via Roche-lobe overflow onto a black hole (BH) or a weakly
magnetized neutron star (NS). It is believed that both the solid surface and
the magnetic field of an NS can affect the accretion flow and show some
observable effects. Using the disk emission dominant data, we compare the disk
evolution of the two types of systems from low luminosity to super-Eddington
luminosity. As the luminosity decreases the disk in the NS LMXB 4U1608--522
begins to leave the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) at much higher
luminosity ($\sim$ 0.1 $L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$), compared with BH LMXBs at much
lower luminosity ($\sim$ 0.03 $L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$), due to the interaction
between the NS magnetosphere and accretion flow. However, as the luminosity
increases above a critical luminosity, the disks in BH and NS LMXBs trace the
same evolutionary pattern, because the magnetosphere is restricted inside ISCO,
and then both the NS surface emission and (dipole) magnetic field do not
significantly affect the secular evolution of the accretion disk, that is
driven by the increased radiation pressure in the inner region. We further
suggest that the NS surface emission provides additional information of
accretion disk, not available in BH systems. Through the observed NS surface
emission, we argue that the disk thickness $H/R$ is less than $0.3-0.4$, and
that the significant outflow from inner disk edge exists at luminosity close to
Eddington luminosity.

observe only a weak interaction between the precursor molecule and the

does not lead to significant changes in the chemical bonding. In contrast, we
find a spontaneous dissociation of the precursor molecule on the partially

observed upon removal of one of the CO ligands from the precursor molecule.
Irrespective of the hydroxylation, the precursor molecule prefers binding of
more than one of its CO ligands. In the light of these results, implications

(LO) to the level of white phase noise by maintaining (not destroying by
projective measurement) the coherence of the ensemble pseudo-spin of atoms over
many measurement cycles. This scheme uses weak measurement to monitor the phase
in Ramsey method and repeat the cycle without initialization of phase and we
call, ""atomic phase lock (APL)"" in this paper. APL will achieve white phase
noise as long as the noise accumulated during dead time and the decoherence are
smaller than the measurement noise. A numerical simulation confirms that with
APL, Allan deviation is averaged down at a maximum rate that is proportional to
the inverse of total measurement time, tau^-1. In contrast, the current atomic
clocks that use projection measurement suppress the noise only down to the
level of white frequency, in which case Allan deviation scales as tau^-1/2.
Faraday rotation is one of the possible ways to realize weak measurement for
APL. We evaluate the strength of Faraday rotation with 171Yb+ ions trapped in a
linear rf-trap and discuss the performance of APL. The main source of the
decoherence is a spontaneous emission induced by the probe beam for Faraday
rotation measurement. One can repeat the Faraday rotation measurement until the
decoherence become comparable to the SNR of measurement. We estimate this
number of cycles to be ~100 cycles for a realistic experimental parameter.

astronomical dust grains, based on solid-state physics. The model uses a
description of the Disordered Charge Distribution (DCD) combined with the
presence of Two-Level Systems (TLS) defects in the amorphous solid composing
the grains. The goal of this paper is to confront this new model to
astronomical observations of different Galactic environments in the FIR/submm,
in order to derive a set of canonical model parameters to be used as a Galactic
reference to be compared to in future Galactic and extragalactic studies. We
confront the TLS model with existing astronomical data. We consider the average
emission spectrum at high latitudes in our Galaxy as measured with FIRAS and
WMAP, as well as the emission from Galactic compact sources observed with
Archeops, for which an inverse relationship between the dust temperature and
the emissivity spectral index has been evidenced. We show that, unlike models
previously proposed which often invoke two dust components at different
temperatures, the TLS model successfully reproduces both the shape of the
Galactic SED and its evolution with temperature as observed in the Archeops
data. The best TLS model parameters indicate a charge coherence length of
\simeq 13 nm and other model parameters in broad agreement with expectations
from laboratory studies of dust analogs. We conclude that the millimeter excess
emission, which is often attributed to the presence of very cold dust in the
diffuse ISM, is likely caused solely by TLS emission in disordered amorphous
dust grains. We discuss the implications of the new model, in terms of mass
determinations from millimeter continuum observations and the expected
variations of the emissivity spectral index with wavelength and dust
temperature. The implications for the analysis of the Herschel and Planck

be viewed as a hybrid combination of Lagrangian and Eulerian methods. The
(Eulerian) boundaries across which we consider (Lagrangian) transport are
kinematically defined by appropriately chosen streamlines of the mean flow. By
evaluating the impact of the mean-eddy interaction on transport, the TIME
method can be used as a diagnostic tool for transport processes that occur
during a specified time interval along a specified boundary segment.
  We introduce two types of TIME functions: one that quantifies the
accumulation of flow properties and another that measures the displacement of
the transport geometry. The spatial geometry of transport is described by the
so-called pseudo-lobes, and temporal evolution of transport by their dynamics.
In the case where the TIME functions are evaluated along a separatrix, the
pseudo-lobes have a relationship to the lobes of Lagrangian transport theory.
In fact, one of the TIME functions is identical to the Melnikov function that
is used to measure the distance, at leading order in a small parameter, between
the two invariant manifolds that define the Lagrangian lobes. We contrast the
similarities and differences between the TIME and Lagrangian lobe dynamics in
detail. An application of the TIME method is carried out for inter-gyre
transport in the wind-driven oceanic circulation model and a comparison with
the Lagrangian transport theory is made.

studied by linking the signals of the instantaneous flux field to the dynamical
variability of the flow. This linkage also reveals how the variability of the
flow contributes to the transport. The spatio-temporal analysis of the flux
diagram can be used to assess the efficiency of the variability in transport
processes. We apply the method to the double-gyre ocean circulation model in
the situation where the Rossby-wave mode dominates the dynamic variability. The
spatio-temporal analysis shows that the inter-gyre transport is controlled by
the circulating eddy vortices in the fast eastward jet region, whereas the
basin-scale Rossby waves have very little impact.

Quantum Gravity. For every operator spin network diagram we construct a
corresponding operator spin foam. Admitting all the spin networks of LQG and
all possible diagrams leads to a clearly defined large class of operator spin
foams. In this way our framework provides a proposal for a class of 2-cell
complexes that should be used in the spin foam theories of LQG. Within this
class, our diagrams are just equivalent to the spin foams. The advantage,
however, in the diagram framework is, that it is self contained, all the
amplitudes can be calculated directly from the diagrams without explicit
visualization of the corresponding spin foams. The spin network diagram
operators and amplitudes are consistently defined on their own. Each diagram
encodes all the combinatorial information. We illustrate applications of our
diagrams: we introduce a diagram definition of Rovelli's surface amplitudes as
well as of the canonical transition amplitudes. Importantly, our operator spin
network diagrams are defined in a sufficiently general way to accommodate all
the versions of the EPRL or the FK model, as well as other possible models. The
diagrams are also compatible with the structure of the LQG Hamiltonian
operators, what is an additional advantage. Finally, a scheme for a complete

the population. Yet for an isolated population of established (and not very
large) size, a more relevant measure may be the population \emph{extinction
risk} due to the interplay of adverse extrinsic variations and intrinsic noise
of birth, death and switching processes. Applying a WKB approximation to the
pertinent master equation of such a two-population system, we quantify the
extinction risk, and find the most likely path to extinction under both
favorable and adverse conditions. Analytical results are obtained both in the
biologically relevant regime when the switching is rare compared with the birth

that rare switches are most beneficial in reducing the extinction risk.

Interstellar dust grains, because of their catalytic properties, are
crucial to the formation of H2, the most abundant molecule in the Universe. The
formation of molecular hydrogen strongly depends on the ability of H atoms to
stick on dust grains. In this study we determine the sticking coefficient of H
atoms chemisorbed on graphitic surfaces, and estimate its impact on the forma-
tion of H2. Methods. The sticking probability of H atoms chemisorbed onto
graphitic surfaces is obtained using a mixed classical-quantum dynamics method.
In this, the H atom is treated quantum- mechanically and the vibrational modes
of the surface are treated classically. The implications of sticking for the
formation of H2 are addressed by using Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that
follow how atoms stick, move and associate with each other on dust surfaces of
different temper- ature. Results. In our model, molecular hydrogen forms very
efficiently for dust temperatures lower than 15 K through the involvement of
physisorbed H atoms. At dust temperatures higher than 15 K and gas temperatures
lower than 2000 K, H2 formation differs strongly if the H atoms com- ing from
the gas phase have to cross a square barrier (usually considered in previous
studies) or a barrier obtained by DFT calculations to become chemisorbed. The
product of sticking times efficiency can be increased by many orders of
magnitude when realistic barriers are considered. If graphite phonons are taken
into account in the dynamics calculations, then H atoms stick better on the
surface at high energies, but the overall H2 formation efficiency is only
slightly affected. Our results suggest that H2 formation can proceed
efficiently in photon dominated regions, X-ray dominated regions, hot cores and
in the early Universe when the first dust is available.

process can keep the disk atmospheres dusty for the lifetime of the disk and
how does the particle properties change as a function of height above the
midplane. We use a Monte Carlo code to follow the mass and porosity evolution
of the particles in time. The used collision model is based on laboratory
experiments performed on dust aggregates. As the experiments cannot cover all
possible collision scenarios, the largest uncertainty of our model is the
necessary extrapolations we had to perform. We simultaneously solve for the
particle growth and motion. Particles can move vertically due to settling and
turbulent mixing. We assume that the vertical profile of the gas density is
fixed in time and only the solid component evolves. We find that the used
collision model strongly influences the masses and sizes of the particles. The
laboratory experiment based collision model greatly reduces the particle sizes
compared to models that assume sticking at all collision velocities. We find
that a turbulence parameter of alpha = 10^-2 is needed to keep the dust
atmospheres dusty, but such strong turbulence can produce only small particles
at the midplane which is not favorable for planetesimal formation models. We
also see that the particles are larger at the midplane and smaller at the upper
layers of the disk. At 3-4 pressure scale heights micron-sized particles are
produced. These particle sizes are needed to explain the 10 micron feature of
disk SEDs. Turbulence may therefore help to keep small dust particles in the
disk atmosphere.

star muLeo. For a subsample of 162 stars, we also derive [Mg/H] from spectral
synthesis around the MgI triplet at 6319A. The Fe and Mg metallicity
distributions are both asymmetric, with median values of +0.16 and +0.21
respectively. The iron distribution is clearly bimodal, as revealed both by a
deconvolution (from observational errors) and a Gaussian decomposition. The
decomposition of the observed Fe and Mg metallicity distributions into Gaussian
components yields two populations of equal sizes (50% each): a metal-poor
component centred around [Fe/H]=-0.30 and [Mg/H]=-0.06 with a large dispersion
and a narrow metal-rich component centred around [Fe/H]=+0.32 and [Mg/H]=+0.35.
The metal poor component shows high [Mg/Fe] ratios (around 0.3) whereas stars
in the metal rich component are found to have near solar ratios. Babusiaux et
al. (2010) also find kinematical differences between the two components: the
metal poor component shows kinematics compatible with an old spheroid whereas
the metal rich component is consistent with a population supporting a bar. In
view of their chemical and kinematical properties, we suggest different
formation scenarios for the two populations: a rapid formation timescale as an
old spheroid for the metal poor component (old bulge) and for the metal rich
component, a formation over a longer time scale driven by the evolution of the
bar (pseudo-bulge).

and secondly we compute its algebraic degree. Our primary aim is to minimize
the algebraic degree, while, at the same time, taking into account the amount
of operations needed to compute our predicate of interest.
  In our predicate analysis we show that the Incircle predicate can be answered
by evaluating the signs of algebraic expressions of degree at most 6; this is
half the algebraic degree we get when we evaluate the Incircle predicate using
the current state-of-the-art approach. In the most demanding cases of our
predicate evaluation, we reduce the problem of answering the Incircle predicate
to the problem of computing the sign of the value of a linear polynomial (in
one variable), when evaluated at a known specific root of a quadratic
polynomial (again in one variable). Another important aspect of our approach is
that, from a geometric point of view, we answer the most difficult case of the
predicate via implicitly performing point locations on an appropriately defined
subdivision of the place induced by the Voronoi circle implicated in the
Incircle predicate.

be cell-bound in the stationary setup, incubation at increasing flow velocities
increasingly antagonized the attachment of both types of surface-modified

grafting with WGA resulted in a pronounced anchoring effect. This was indicated
by a mean number of 747 {\pm} 241 mm-2 and 104 {\pm} 44 mm-2 attached particles

series measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a level
hitherto possible only for the Sun, the results from Kepler will vastly
increase our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. Here
we report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of most
interest for detection of exoplanets via transits. By design the data from
moderately bright Kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levels
of noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamental
limitations such as Poisson statistics and any instrument noise. The noise
levels attained by Kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50% the target levels for
solar-type, quiet stars. We provide a decomposition of observed noise for an
ensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (Poisson and
readout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to the

restrictive hypotheses on the associated spectrum. In this paper, we
reinvestigate the ""Spectral implies Tiling"" part of Fuglede's conjecture for
the three interval case. We first show that the ""Spectral implies Tiling"" for
two intervals follows from the simple fact that two distinct circles have at
most two points of intersections. We then attempt this for the case of three
intervals and except for one situation are able to prove ""Spectral implies
Tiling"". Finally, for the exceptional case, we show a connection to a problem
of generalized Vandermonde varieties.

for magnetic fields and relativistic particles in cluster outskirts come from
observations of so-called radio relics, which are megaparsec-sized regions of

to light ratios, we had found that the theory is able to account for the
systematics that is observed in the entire set of galactic rotation curves

our study to incorporate a further 27 galaxies of which 25 are dwarf galaxies

been accounted for by the conformal gravity theory. Since one of the primary
ingredients in the theory is a universal contribution to galactic motions
coming from matter exterior to the galaxies, and thus independent of them, our
study reinforces one of the central concepts of the conformal gravity studies,
namely that invoking dark matter should be viewed as being nothing more than an
attempt to describe global physics contributions in purely local galactic
terms.

the \textit{mean} current vanishes because of fluctuations. In particular, we
show that a current with Gaussian white noise takes the system to a unique

Tsallis escort $q$-distributions. Considering the fully developed turbulence as

to the log-normal model which removes its shortcomings with regard to the
decreasing higher order moments and the Novikov inequality, and obtain

of recent papers for several key quantities, such as the expected delivery time
of a unicast message, or the flooding time (a measure of how fast information
spreads). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing results
is derived under a mobility model which is able to reproduce the power
law+exponential tail dichotomy of the pairwise node inter-contact time
distribution which has been observed in traces of several real opportunistic
networks.
  The contributions of this paper are two-fold: first, we present a simple
pairwise contact model -- called the Home-MEG model -- for opportunistic
networks based on the observation made in previous work that pairs of nodes in
the network tend to meet in very few, selected locations (home locations); this
contact model is shown to be able to faithfully reproduce the power
law+exponential tail dichotomy of inter-contact time. Second, we use the
Home-MEG model to analyze flooding time in opportunistic networks, presenting
asymptotic bounds on flooding time that assume different initial conditions for
the existence of opportunistic links.
  Finally, our bounds provide some analytical evidences that the speed of
information spreading in opportunistic networks can be much faster than that
predicted by simple geometric mobility models.

Reynolds number we present an analogy with the kinetic theory of gases, with
dipoles made of quasi-rigid and 'dressed' vortex tubes as frictionless,
incompressible but deformable quasi-particles. Their movements are governed by
Helmholtz' elementary vortex rules applied locally. A contact interaction or
'collision' leads either to random scatter of a trajectory or to the formation
of two likewise rotating, fundamentally unstable whirls forming a dissipative
patch slowly rotating around its center of mass which is almost at rest. This
approach predicts von Karman's constant as 1/sqrt(2 pi) = 0.399 and the
spatio-temporal dynamics of energy-containing time and length scales
controlling turbulent mixing [Baumert 2009]. A link to turbulence spectra was
missing so far. In the present paper it is shown that the above image of random
vortex-dipole movements is compatible with Kolmogorov's turbulence spectra if
dissipative patches, beginning as two likewise rotating eddies, evolve locally
into a space-filling bearing in the sense of Herrmann [1990], i.e. into an
""Apollonian gear"". Its parts and pieces are incompressible and flexibly
deformable vortex tubes which are frictionless, excepting the dissipative scale
of size zero. For steady and locally homogeneous conditions our approach
predicts the dimensionless pre-factor in the 3D Eulerian wavenumber spectrum as
[(4 pi)^2/3]/3 = 1.8, and in the Lagrangian frequency spectrum as 2. Our
derivations rest on geometry, methods from many-particle physics, and on
