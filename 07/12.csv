proposed to be a signature of the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. Recent
modeling of the SiO emission across C-shocks predicts variations in the SiO
line intensity and line shape at the precursor and intermediate-velocity
regimes in only few years. We present high-angular resolution (3.8""x3.3"")
images of the thermal SiO J=2-1 emission toward the L1448-mm outflow in two
epochs (November 2004-February 2005, March-April 2009). Several SiO
condensations have appeared at intermediate velocities (20-50 km/s) toward the
red-shifted lobe of the outflow since 2005. Toward one of the condensations
(clump D), systematic differences of the dirty beams between 2005 and 2009
could be responsible for the SiO variability. At higher velocities (50-80
km/s), SiO could also have experienced changes in its intensity. We propose
that the SiO variability toward L1448-mm is due to a real SiO enhancement by
young C-shocks at the internal working surface between the jet and the ambient
gas. For the precursor regime (5.2-9.2 km/s), several narrow and faint SiO
components are detected. Narrow SiO tends to be compact, transient and shows
elongated (bow-shock) morphologies perpendicular to the jet. We speculate that
these features are associated with the precursor of C-shocks appearing at the
interface of the new SiO components seen at intermediate velocities.

uncorrelated beam. If a correlated beam with two small eigen-emittances can be
produced, removal of the correlations via appropriate optics will lead to two
small emittance values, provided non-linear effects are not too large. We study
how such a beam may be produced using minimal linear correlations. We find it

difficult to realize in practice. We identify linear correlations that may lead

These observations provided an unprecedented opportunity to study nearly
pristine material from the surface and what was until recently the interior of
an ecliptic comet - cometary surface having experienced only two prior
perihelion passages, and including material that was totally fresh. The spectra
were modeled using a variety of mineral types including both amorphous and
crystalline components. We find that the degree of silicate crystallinity, ~
35%, is somewhat lower than most other comets with strong emission features,
while its abundance of amorphous carbon is higher. Both suggest that SW3 is
among the most chemically primitive solar system objects yet studied in detail,
and that it formed earlier or farther from the sun than the bulk of the comets
studied so far. The similar dust compositions of the two fragments suggests
that these are not mineralogically heterogeneous, but rather uniform throughout
their volumes. Atomic abundances derived from the spectral models indicates a
depletion of O compared to solar photospheric values, despite the inclusion of
water ice and gas in the models. Atomic C may be solar or slightly sub-solar,
but its abundance is complicated by the potential contribution of spectrally
featureless mineral species to the portion of the spectra most sensitive to the
derication of the C abundance. We find a relatively high bolometric albedo, ~
0.13 for the dust, considering the large amount of dark carbonaceous material,

emission features.

in situ chemical processes during the disk phase, but also by the history of
the gas and dust before it accreted from the natal envelope. In order to
understand the disk's chemical composition at the time of planet formation,
especially in the midplane, one has to go back in time and retrace the
chemistry to the molecular cloud that collapsed to form the disk and the
central star. Here we present a new astrochemical model that aims to do just
that. The model follows the core collapse and disk formation in two dimensions,
which turns out to be a critical upgrade over older collapse models. We predict
chemical stratification in the disk due to different physical conditions
encountered along different streamlines. We argue that the disk-envelope
accretion shock does not play a significant role for the material in the disk
at the end of the collapse phase. Finally, our model suggests that complex
organic species are formed on the grain surfaces at temperatures of 20 to 40 K,

Although there are many approaches to assess and repair a single inconsistent
knowledge base, the heterogeneous nature of Multi-Context Systems poses
problems which have not yet been addressed in a satisfying way: How to identify
and explain a inconsistency that spreads over multiple knowledge bases with
different logical formalisms (e.g., logic programs and ontologies)? What are
the causes of inconsistency if inference/information exchange is non-monotonic
(e.g., absent information as cause)? How to deal with inconsistency if access
to knowledge bases is restricted (e.g., companies exchange information, but do
not allow arbitrary modifications to their knowledge bases)? Many traditional
approaches solely aim for a consistent system, but automatic removal of
inconsistency is not always desireable. Therefore a human operator has to be
supported in finding the erroneous parts contributing to the inconsistency. In
my thesis those issues will be adressed mainly from a foundational perspective,
while our research project also provides algorithms and prototype
implementations.

RA combines the flexibility and robustness needed for reliable communications

important observations. First, it is not so significant to approximate the
channel but rather the rate, such that the optimal scheduling decision can be
mimicked at the base station. Second, a fixed transmit codebook at the
transmitter is often better when therefore the channel state information is
more accurate. In the RA scheme the transmit and feedback codebook are
separated and user rates are delivered to the base station subject to a
controlled uniform error. The scheme is analyzed and proved to have better
performance below a certain interference plus noise margin and better behavior
than the classical Jindal formula. LTE system simulations sustain the analytic
results showing performance gains of up to 50% or 70% compared to zeroforcing
when using multiple antennas at the base station and multiple antennas or a
single antenna at the terminals, respectively. A new feedback protocol is
developed which inherently considers the transmit codebook and which is able to

degree of alignment between the equators of stars and the orbits of the planets

reveal the same information from the photometric discovery data, with no need
for follow-up. A spot model fit to the global light curve, parametrized by the
spin orientation of the star, predicts when the planet will transit the spots.
Observing several spot crossings during different transits then leads to
constraints on the spin-orbit alignment. In cases where stellar spots are
small, the stellar inclination, and hence the true alignment, rather than just
the sky projection, can be obtained. This method has become possible with the
advent of space telescopes such as CoRoT and Kepler, which photometrically
monitor transiting planets over a nearly continuous, long time baseline. We
apply our method to CoRoT-2, and find the projected spin-orbit alignment angle,
lambda= 4.7 deg +/- 12.3 deg, in excellent agreement with a previous
determination that employed the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The large spots of
the parent star, CoRoT-2, limit our precision on the stellar inclination: i_s =
84 deg +/- 36 deg, where i_s < 90 deg (> 90 deg) indicates the rotation axis is
tilted towards (away from) the line of sight.

thus more prone to speedy coagulation and planet formation. Pre-existing
planetary systems are compressed by gas inflows leading to a natural occurrence
of close-in misaligned hot Jupiters and short-period eccentric planets. The
likelihood of such events mainly depends on the gas content of the cluster and
is thus expected to be highest in the youngest star clusters.

the additional uncertainty from large logarithms due to the jet boundary
cancels when neighboring bins are added. This procedure is tested for H + 0, 1

dimensions, defined as a superposition of chiral spirals oriented in different
directions. We divide a two-dimensional Fermi sea into distinct wedges,
characterized by the opening angle 2Theta and depth Q ~ pF, where pF is the
Fermi momentum. In each wedge, the energy is lowered by forming a single chiral
spiral. The optimal values for Theta and Q are chosen by balancing this gain in
energy versus the cost of deforming the Fermi surface (which dominates at large
Theta) and patch-patch interactions (dominant at small Theta). Using a
non-local four-Fermi interaction model, we estimate the gain and cost in energy
by expanding in terms of 1/Nc (where Nc is the number of colors), lqcd/Q, and
Theta. Due to a form factor in our non-local model, at small 1/Nc the mass gap
(chiral condensate) is large, and the interaction among quarks and the
condensate local in momentum space. Consequently, interactions between
different patches are localized near their boundaries, and it is simple to
embed many chiral spirals. We identify the dominant and subdominant terms at
high density and categorize formulate an expansion in terms of lqcd/Q or Theta.
The kinetic term in the transverse directions is subdominant, so that
techniques from (1+1)-dimensional systems can be utilized. To leading order in
1/Nc and lqcd/Q, the total gain in energy is ~ pF lqcd^2 with Theta ~
(lqcd/pF)^{3/5}. Since Theta decreases with increasing pF, there should be
phase transitions associated with the change in the wedge number. We also argue
the effects of subdominant terms at lower density where the large-Nc
approximation is more reliable.

width and infinite length. The 3D spin glass is represented as an ensemble of
disordered 1D spatial spin-chains (SSC) where interactions are random between
spin-chains (nonideal ensemble of 1D SSCs). It is proved that at the limit of
Birkhoff's ergodic hypothesis performance 3D spin glasses can be generated by
Hamiltonian of disordered 1D SSC with random environment. Disordered 1D SSC is
defined on a regular lattice where one randomly oriented spin is put on each
node of lattice. Also it is supposed that each spin randomly interacts with six
nearest-neighboring spins (two spins on lattice and four in the environment).
The recurrent transcendental equations are obtained on the nodes of spin-chain
lattice. These equations combined with the Silvester conditions allow step by
step construct spin-chain in the ground state of energy where all spins are in
minimal energy of classical Hamiltonian. On the basis of these equations an
original high-performance parallel algorithm is developed for 3D spin glasses
simulation. Distributions of different parameters of unperturbed spin glass are
calculated. In particular, it is analytically proved and by numerical
calculations shown that the distribution of spin-spin interaction constant in
Heisenberg nearest-neighboring Hamiltonian model as opposed to widely used
Gauss-Edwards- Anderson distribution satisfies L\'evy alpha-stable distribution
law which does not have variance. A new formula is proposed for construction of
partition function in kind of one-dimensional integral on energy distribution
of 1D SSCs

processes (MDPs) provide models for systems with both probabilistic and
nondeterministic behaviors. We consider turn-based stochastic games with two
classical quantitative objectives: discounted-sum and long-run average
objectives. The game models and the quantitative objectives are widely used in
probabilistic verification, planning, optimal inventory control, network
protocol and performance analysis. Games and MDPs that model realistic systems
often have very large state spaces, and probabilistic abstraction techniques
are necessary to handle the state-space explosion. The commonly used
full-abstraction techniques do not yield space-savings for systems that have
many states with similar value, but does not necessarily have similar
transition structure. A semi-abstraction technique, namely Magnifying-lens
abstractions (MLA), that clusters states based on value only, disregarding
differences in their transition relation was proposed for qualitative
objectives (reachability and safety objectives). In this paper we extend the
MLA technique to solve stochastic games with discounted-sum and long-run
average objectives. We present the MLA technique based abstraction-refinement
algorithm for stochastic games and MDPs with discounted-sum objectives. For
long-run average objectives, our solution works for all MDPs and a sub-class of

nuclearity properties in this setting raised many stability problems. In this
paper we examine the preservation of these nuclearity properties including
exactness, local liftability and the double commutant expectation property
under basic algebraic operations such as quotient, duality, coproducts and
tensor products. We show that, in the finite dimensional case, exactness and
lifting property are dual pairs, that is, an operator system $S$ is exact if
and only if the dual operator system $S^d$ has the lifting property. Moreover,
the lifting property is preserved under quotients by null subspaces. Again in
the finite dimensional case we prove that every operator system has the
k-lifting property in the sense that whenever $f:S -> A/I$ is a unital and
completely positive map, where A is a C*-algebra and I is an ideal, then $f$
possess a unital k-positive lift on A, for every k. This property provides a
novel proof of a classical result of Smith and Ward on the preservation of
matricial numerical ranges of an operator.
  The Kirchberg conjecture naturally falls into this context. We show that the
Kirchberg conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the five dimensional
universal operator system generated by two contraction ($S_2$) has the double
commutant expectation property. In addition to this we give several equivalent
statements to this conjecture regarding the preservation of various nuclearity
properties under basic algebraic operations. We show that the Smith Ward
problem is equivalent to the statement that every three dimensional operator
system has the lifting property (or exactness). If we suppose that both the
Kirchberg conjecture and the Smith Ward problem have an affirmative answer then
this implies that every three dimensional operator system is C*-nuclear.

obtained in each individual experiment, is tackled by solving models. After an
introduction we review the many dynamical models proposed over the years. A
flexible and rather realistic model is introduced, describing the measurement
of the $z$-component of a spin through interaction with a magnetic memory
simulated by a Curie--Weiss magnet, including $N \gg1$ spins weakly coupled to
a phonon bath. Initially prepared in a metastable paramagnetic state, it may
transit to its up or down ferromagnetic state, triggered by its coupling with
the tested spin, so that its magnetization acts as a pointer.
  A detailed solution of the dynamical equations is worked out. Conditions are
found, which ensure that the process satisfies the features of ideal
measurements. Various imperfections are discussed, as well as attempts of
incompatible measurements. The first steps consist in the solution of the
Hamiltonian dynamics for the spin-apparatus density matrix $D(t)$. On a longer
time scale, the trend towards equilibrium of the magnet produces a final state
$D(t_{\rm f})$ that involves correlations between the system and the
indications of the pointer, thus ensuring registration. A difficulty lies in a
quantum ambiguity: There exist many incompatible decompositions of the density
matrix $\scriptD(t_{\rm f})$. This difficulty is overcome by dynamics due to
suitable interactions within the apparatus.
  Any subset of runs thus reaches over a brief delay a stable state which
satisfies the same hierarchic property as in classical probability theory.
Standard quantum statistical mechanics alone appears sufficient to explain the
occurrence of a unique answer in each run. Finally, pedagogical exercises are
proposed while the statistical interpretation is promoted for teaching.

with how they form. Here, we review the theory and observations of cluster
disruption, both the suggested initial rapid dissolution phase (infant
mortality) and the longer timescale processes that affect clusters after they
emerge from their progenitor GMCs. Over the past decade, the standard paradigm
that has developed is that all/most stars are formed in clusters and that the
vast majority of these groups are disrupted over short timescales (< 10 Myr).
This is thought to be due to the removal of the left over gas from the
star-formation process, known as infant mortality. However, recent results have
suggested that the fraction of stars that form in clusters has been
overestimated, with the majority being formed in unbound groups (i.e.
associations) which expand and disrupt without the need of invoking gas
removal. Dynamical measurements of young massive clusters in the Galaxy suggest
that clusters reach a stable equilibrium at very young (<3 Myr) ages,
suggesting that gas expulsion has little effect on the cluster. After the early
dynamical phase, clusters appear to be long lived and stable objects. We use
the recent WFC3 image of the cluster population in M83 to test empirical
disruption laws and find that the lifetime of clusters strongly depends on
their ambient environment. While the role of cluster mass is less well
constrained (due to the added parameter of the form of the cluster mass
function), we find evidence suggesting that higher mass clusters survive
longer, and that the cluster mass function (at least in M83, outside the
nuclear region) is truncated above ~10^5Msun.

addresses those topics by deriving steady-state solutions for clusters in which
radiative cooling, electron thermal conduction, and thermal feedback fueled by

cool-core clusters in terms of steady-state models. It finds that the core
configurations of many cool-core clusters have entropy levels just below those
of conductively balanced solutions in which magnetic fields have suppressed
electron thermal conduction to ~1/3 of the full Spitzer value, suggesting that
AGN feedback is triggered when conduction can no longer compensate for

solvers for a class of semilinear elliptic interface problems. We are
particularly interested in nonlinear problems with discontinuous diffusion
coefficients, such as the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation and its
regularizations. The algorithm we study consists of the standard
SOLVE-ESTIMATE-MARK-REFINE procedure common to many adaptive finite element
algorithms, but where the SOLVE step involves only a full solve on the coarsest
level, and the remaining levels involve only single Newton updates to the
previous approximate solution. We summarize a recently developed AFEM
convergence theory for inexact solvers, and present a sequence of numerical
experiments that give evidence that the theory does in fact predict the
contraction properties of AFEM with inexact solvers. The various routines used
are all designed to maintain a linear-time computational complexity.

well-studied supernova 1987A produced by the blue supergiant in the Large
Magellanic Cloud. We study a peculiar supernova 2000cb and compare it with the
supernova 1987A. We carried out hydrodynamic simulations of the supernova in an
extended parameter space to describe its light curve and spectroscopic data.
The hydrogen H-alpha and H-beta lines are modeled using a time-dependent
approach. We constructed the hydrodynamic model by fitting the photometric and
spectroscopic observations. We infer a presupernova radius of 35 Rsun, an
ejecta mass of 22.3 Msun, an explosion energy of 4.4x10^{51} erg, and a
radioactive Ni-56 mass of 0.083 Msun. The estimated progenitor mass on the main
sequence lies in the range of 24-28 Msun. The early H-alpha profile on day 7 is
consistent with the density distribution found from hydrodynamic modeling,
while the H-alpha line on day 40 indicates an extended Ni-56 mixing up to a
velocity of 8400 km/s. We emphasize that the dome-like light curves of both
supernova 2000cb and supernova 1987A are entirely powered by radioactive decay.
This is unlike normal type IIP supernovae, the plateau of which is dominated by
the internal energy deposited after the shock wave propagation through the
presupernova. We find signatures of the explosion asymmetry in the photospheric
and nebular spectra. The explosion energy of supernova 2000cb is higher by a
factor of three compared to supernova 1987A, which poses a serious problem for
explosion mechanisms of type IIP supernovae.

rounds. The games are concurrent: in each round, the two players choose their
moves simultaneously; the current state and the moves determine the successor.
We consider omega-regular winning conditions given as parity objectives. We
consider the qualitative analysis problems: the computation of the almost-sure
and limit-sure winning set of states, where player 1 can ensure to win with
probability 1 and with probability arbitrarily close to 1, respectively. In
general the almost-sure and limit-sure winning strategies require both
infinite-memory and infinite-precision. We study the bounded-rationality
problem for qualitative analysis of concurrent parity games, where the strategy
set player 1 is restricted to bounded-resource strategies. In terms of
precision, strategies can be deterministic, uniform, finite-precision or
infinite-precision; and in terms of memory, strategies can be memoryless,
finite-memory or infinite-memory. We present a precise and complete
characterization of the qualitative winning sets for all combinations of
classes of strategies. In particular, we show that uniform memoryless
strategies are as powerful as finite-precision infinite-memory strategies, and
infinite-precision memoryless strategies are as powerful as infinite-precision
finite-memory strategies. We show that the winning sets can be computed in
O(n^{2d+3}) time, where n is the size of the game and 2d is the number of
priorities, and our algorithms are symbolic. The membership problem of whether
a state belongs to a winning set can be decided in NP cap coNP. While this
complexity is the same as for the simpler class of turn-based games, where in
each state only one of the players has a choice of moves, our algorithms, that
are obtained by characterization of the winning sets as mu-calculus formulas,
are considerably more involved.

soft and hard AGN host galaxies at z ~ 1 due to color contamination from
point-source AGN emission. We use a cloning simulation to develop a calibration
between concentration and this color contamination and use this to correct host
galaxy colors.
  The mean u - R color of the unobscured/soft hosts beyond ~6 kpc is
statistically equivalent to that of the obscured/hard hosts (the soft sources
are 0.09 +/- 0.16 magnitudes bluer). Furthermore, the rest-frame V - J colors
of the obscured and unobscured hosts beyond ~6 kpc are statistically
equivalent, suggesting that the two populations have similar distributions of
dust extinction. For the WFC3/IR sample, the mean NUV - R color gradients of
unobscured and obscured sources differ by less than ~0.5 magnitudes for r > 1.1

the star formation rate beyond ~1 kpc.
  These observations favor a unification scenario for intermediate-luminosity
AGNs in which obscuration is determined geometrically. Scenarios in which the

solutions of Schr\""{o}dinger's equation for few-electron problems. We extend
the method's scope to wave functions with non-zero angular momentum and test it
on several challenging problems. One group of tests involves the determination
of the nonrelativistic electric dipole oscillator strength for the helium
$1^1$S $\to 2^1$P transition. The result achieved, $0.27616499(27)$, is
comparable to the best in the literature.
  Another group of test applications is comprised of well-studied leading order
finite nuclear mass and relativistic corrections for the helium ground state. A
straightforward computation reaches near state-of-the-art accuracy without
requiring the implementation of any special-purpose numerics.
  All the relevant quantities tested in this paper -- energy eigenvalues,
S-state expectation values and bound-bound dipole transitions for S and P
states -- converge exponentially with increasing resolution and do so at
roughly the same rate. Each individual calculation samples and weights the
configuration space wave function uniquely but all behave in a qualitatively
similar manner. Quantum mechanical matrix elements are directly and reliably
calculable with pseudospectral methods.
  The technical discussion includes a prescription for choosing coordinates and
subdomains to achieve exponential convergence when two-particle Coulomb
singularities are present. The prescription does not account for the wave
function's non-analytic behavior near the three-particle coalescence which
should eventually hinder the rate of the convergence. Nonetheless the effect is
small in the sense that ignoring the higher-order coalescence does not appear
to affect adversely the accuracy of any of the quantities reported nor the rate
at which errors diminish.

semi-empirical potential of van Beest, Kramer and van Santen to construct the
Hugoniot of quartz. Our scheme mimics the real world experimental set up by
using a flyer-plate impactor to initiate the shock wave and is the first shock
wave simulation that uses a geom- etry optimised system of a polar slab in a
3-dimensional system employing periodic boundary conditions. Our scheme also
includes the relaxation of the surface dipole in the polar quartz slab which is
an essential pre-requisite to a stable simulation. The original BKS potential
is unsuited to shock wave calculations and so we propose a simple modification.
With this modification, we find that our calculated Hugoniot is in good
agreement with experimental shock wave data up to 25 GPa, but significantly
diverges beyond this point. We conclude that our modified BKS potential is
suitable for quartz under representative pressure conditions of the Earth core,
but unsuitable for high-pressure shock wave simulations. We also find that the
BKS potential incorrectly prefers the {\beta}-quartz phase over the
{\alpha}-quartz phase at zero-temperature, and that there is a {\beta}

inflationary stage, related to the Standard Model Higgs field, but also a late
period of Dark Energy domination, associated with an almost massless dilaton. A
number of parameters can be fixed by inflationary physics, allowing to make
specific predictions for any subsequent period. In particular, we derive a
relation between the tilt of the primordial spectrum of scalar fluctuations,
$n_s$, and the present value of the equation of state parameter of dark energy,
$\omega_{DE}^0$. We find bounds for the scalar tilt, $n_s<0.97$, the associated
running, $-0.0006<d\ln n_s/d\ln k\lesssim-0.00015$, and for the
scalar-to-tensor ratio, $0.0009\lesssim r<0.0033$, which will be critically
tested by the results of the Planck mission. For the equation of state of dark

taking account of spin relaxation of conduction electrons. The theory is
developed by calculating spin and charge transport driven by two kinds of gauge
fields; one is the ordinary electromagnetic field $A^{\rm em}_{\mu}$, and the
other is the effective gauge field $A^{z}_{\mu}$ induced by dynamical magnetic
texture. The latter acts in the spin channel and gives rise to a spin motive
force. It is found that the current induced as a linear response to
$A^{z}_{\mu}$ is not gauge-invariant in the presence of spin-flip processes.
This fact is intimately related to the non-conservation of spin via Onsager
reciprocity, so is robust, but indicates a theoretical inconsistency. This
problem is resolved by considering the time dependence of spin-relaxation
source terms in the ""rotated frame"", as in the previous study on Gilbert
damping [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 76}, 063710 (2007)]. This effect restores the
gauge invariance while keeping spin non-conservation. It also gives a
dissipative spin motive force expected as a reciprocal to the dissipative spin
torque (""$\beta$-term"").

Surprisingly, we find pervasive temporal asymmetries in the statistics of such
stationary processes with the consequence that the computational resources
necessary to generate a process in the forward and reverse temporal directions
are generally not the same. In fact, an exhaustive survey indicates that most
stationary processes are irreversible. We study the ensuing relations between
model topology in different representations, the process's statistical
properties, and its reversibility in detail. A process's temporal asymmetry is
efficiently captured using two canonical unifilar representations of the
generating model, the forward-time and reverse-time epsilon-machines. We
analyze example irreversible processes whose epsilon-machine presentations
change size under time reversal, including one which has a finite number of
recurrent causal states in one direction, but an infinite number in the
opposite. From the forward-time and reverse-time epsilon-machines, we are able
to construct a symmetrized, but nonunifilar, generator of a process---the
bidirectional machine. Using the bidirectional machine, we show how to directly
calculate a process's fundamental information properties, many of which are

Though the original proof of this result was nonconstructive, several
constructive proofs have subsequently been found. Most of these constructive
proofs rely on Givens rotations, and none have been shown to be able to produce
every example of such a matrix. We introduce a new construction method that is
able to do so. This method is based on recent advances in finite frame theory
which show how to construct frames whose frame operator has a given prescribed
spectrum and whose vectors have given prescribed lengths. This frame
construction requires one to find a sequence of eigensteps, that is, a sequence
of interlacing spectra that satisfy certain trace considerations. In this
paper, we show how to explicitly construct every such sequence of eigensteps.
Here, the key idea is to visualize eigenstep construction as iteratively
building a staircase. This visualization leads to an algorithm, dubbed Top
Kill, which produces a valid sequence of eigensteps whenever it is possible to
do so. We then build on Top Kill to explicitly parametrize the set of all valid
eigensteps. This yields an explicit method for constructing all self-adjoint
matrices with a given spectrum and diagonal, and moreover all frames whose
frame operator has a given spectrum and whose elements have given lengths.

also holds together the individual graphene sheets in multilayer samples. Here
we use a pressurized blister test to directly measure the adhesion energy of

0.45 \pm 0.02 J/m2 for monolayer graphene and 0.31 \pm 0.03 J/m2 for samples
containing 2-5 graphene sheets. These values are larger than the adhesion
energies measured in typical micromechanical structures and are comparable to
solid/liquid adhesion energies. We attribute this to the extreme flexibility of
graphene, which allows it to conform to the topography of even the smoothest
substrates, thus making its interaction with the substrate more liquid-like

importance of stochastic fluctuations has been appreciated for chemotaxis, it
is currently believed that deterministic long-range fluid dynamical effects
govern cell-cell and cell-surface scattering - the elementary events that lead
to swarming and collective swimming in active suspensions and to the formation
of biofilms. Here, we report the first direct measurements of the bacterial
flow field generated by individual swimming Escherichia coli both far from and
near to a solid surface. These experiments allowed us to examine the relative
importance of fluid dynamics and rotational diffusion for bacteria. For
cell-cell interactions it is shown that thermal and intrinsic stochasticity
drown the effects of long-range fluid dynamics, implying that physical
interactions between bacteria are determined by steric collisions and
near-field lubrication forces. This dominance of short-range forces closely
links collective motion in bacterial suspensions to self-organization in driven
granular systems, assemblages of biofilaments, and animal flocks. For the
scattering of bacteria with surfaces, long-range fluid dynamical interactions
are also shown to be negligible before collisions; however, once the bacterium
swims along the surface within a few microns after an aligning collision,
hydrodynamic effects can contribute to the experimentally observed, long
residence times. As these results are based on purely mechanical properties,
they apply to a wide range of microorganisms.

extended emission. This can result from intrinsic source size effects or
scatter broadening in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM), in excess of the expected
(1+z)^0.5 angular diameter scaling of brightness temperature limited sources
due to cosmological expansion. We report here 4.9 GHz and 8.4 GHz observations
and data analysis for a sample of 140 compact, flat-spectrum sources which may
allow us to determine the origin of this angular diameter-redshift relation by
exploiting their different wavelength dependences. In addition to using ISS as
a cosmological probe, the observations provide additional insight into source
morphologies and the characteristics of ISS. As in the MASIV Survey, the
variability of the sources is found to be significantly correlated with
line-of-sight H-alpha intensities, confirming its link with ISS. For 25
sources, time delays of about 0.15 to 3 days are observed between the
scintillation patterns at both frequencies, interpreted as being caused by a
shift in core positions when probed at different optical depths. Significant
correlation is found between ISS amplitudes and source spectral index; in
particular, a large drop in ISS amplitudes is observed at spectral indices of <
-0.4 confirming that steep spectrum sources scintillate less. We detect a
weakened redshift dependence of ISS at 8.4 GHz over that at 4.9 GHz, with the

computational complexity needed to compute expected values of functions of the

exploiting a coupling of the requisite processes that is easy to simulate while
providing a small variance for the estimator. Further, and in a stark departure
from other implementations of multi-level Monte Carlo, we show how to produce
an unbiased estimator that is significantly less computationally expensive than
the usual unbiased estimator arising from exact algorithms in conjunction with
crude Monte Carlo. We thereby dramatically improve, in a quantifiable manner,
the basic computational complexity of current approaches that have many names

Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, discrete event simulation, dynamic Monte Carlo,
kinetic Monte Carlo, the n-fold way, the next reaction method,the
residence-time algorithm, the stochastic simulation algorithm, Gillespie's
algorithm, and tau-leaping. The new algorithm applies generically, but we also
give an example where the coupling idea alone, even without a multi-level
discretization, can be used to improve efficiency by exploiting system
structure. Stochastically modeled chemical reaction networks provide a very

ion run, during which nearly 10 inverse microbarns of luminosity were
delivered. Soft physics results include charged particle multiplicities and
collective flow. The charged particle multiplicity, which tracks initial state
entropy production, increases by a factor of two relative to the top RHIC
energy, with a centrality dependence very similar to that already measured at
RHIC. Measurements of elliptic flow out to large transverse momentum also show
similar results to what was measured at RHIC, but no significant pseudorapidity
dependence. Extensions of these measurements to higher harmonics have also been
made, and can be used to explain structures in the two-particle correlation
functions that had long been attributed to jet-medium interactions. New hard
probe measurements include single muons, jets and high $p_T$ hadrons. Single
muons at high momentum are used to extract the yield of $W^{\pm}$ bosons and
are found to be consistent within statistical uncertainties with binary
collision scaling. Conversely, jets are found to be suppressed in central
events by a factor of two relative to peripheral events, with no significant
dependence on the jet energy. Fragmentation functions are also found to be the
same in central and peripheral events. Finally, charged hadrons have been
measured out to 30 GeV, and their centrality dependence relative to peripheral
events is similar to that found for jets.

galactic nuclei (AGNs). We examine the properties of infrared (IR) emission
from the inner edge of the dusty torus in AGNs, which are powered by super- or
sub-Eddington accretion flows around black holes, by considering the dependence
of the polar angle on the radiation flux of accretion flows (Watarai et al.
2005). We find that for super-Eddington AGNs, of which the mass accretion rate
is more than 10^2 times larger than the Eddington rate, the ratio of the AGN IR
luminosity and the disc bolometric luminosity is less than 10^-2, unless the
half opening angle of the torus (theta_torus) is small (theta_torus <65
degree). This is due to the self-occultation effect, whereby the
self-absorption at the outer region of the super-Eddington flow dilutes the
illumination of the torus. Such a small luminosity ratio is not observed in
sub-Eddington AGNs, whose mass accretion rate is comparable to or no more than
10 times larger than the Eddington mass accretion rate, except for extremely
thin tori (theta_torus >85 degree). We also consider the properties of the
near-IR (NIR) emission radiated from hot dust >1000 K. We find that
super-Eddington AGNs have a ratio of the NIR luminosity to the bolometric
luminosity, L_NIR,AGN/L_bol,disc, at least one order of magnitude smaller than
for sub-Eddington AGNs for a wide range of half opening angle (theta_torus > 65
degree), for various types of dusty torus model. Thus, a relatively low
L_NIR,AGN/L_bol,disc is a property that allows identification of candidate
super-Eddington AGNs. Lastly, we discuss the possibility that NIR-faint quasars
at redshift z=6 discovered by a recent deep SDSS survey may be young quasars
whose black holes grow via super-Eddington accretion.

further applied to any independent set system defined by the intersection of a

Symmetry Subgroup Problem (HSSP), which is a generalization of the well-studied
Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP). Given a group acting on a set and an oracle
whose level sets define a partition of the set, the task is to recover the
subgroup of symmetries of this partition inside the group. The HSSP provides a
unifying framework that, besides the HSP, encompasses a wide range of algebraic
oracle problems, including quadratic hidden polynomial problems. While the HSSP
can have provably exponential quantum query complexity, we obtain efficient
quantum algorithms for various interesting cases. To achieve this, we present a
general method for reducing the HSSP to the HSP, which works efficiently in
several cases related to symmetries of polynomials. The HSSP therefore connects
in a rather surprising way certain hidden polynomial problems with the HSP.
Using this connection, we obtain the first efficient quantum algorithm for the
hidden polynomial problem for multivariate quadratic polynomials over fields of
constant characteristic. We also apply the new methods to polynomial function
graph problems and present an efficient quantum procedure for constant degree
multivariate polynomials over any field. This result improves in several ways
the currently known algorithms.

exhibit flaring activity and strong aperiodic variability on time scales
comparable to or shorter than their pulsation period. Such a behavior shows
that the accretion flow in the vicinity of the accretor must be highly
non-stationary. Observational study of this phenomenon is often problematic as
it requires very high statistics of X-ray data and a specific analysis
technique. Aims: In our research we used high-resolution data taken with RXTE
and INTEGRAL on a sample of bright transient and persistent pulsars, to perform
an in-depth study of their variability on time scales comparable to the
pulsation period - ""pulse-to-pulse variability"". Methods: The high-quality data
allowed us to collect individual pulses of different amplitude and explore
their X-ray spectrum as a function of pulse amplitude. The described approach
allowed us for the first time to study the luminosity-dependence of pulsars'
X-ray spectra in observations where the averaged (over many pulse cycles)
luminosity of the source remains constant. Results: In all studied pulsars we
revealed significant spectral changes as a function of the pulse height both in
the continuum and in the cyclotron absorption features. The sources appear to
form two groups showing different dependencies of the spectrum on pulse height.
We interpret such a division as a manifestation of two distinct accretion
regimes that are at work in different pulsars.

of the dependence structure between the components of multidimensional binary
responses. The key for the dependence modelling is the covariance matrix of an
underlying latent multivariate Gaussian. Most approaches to MLE in multivariate
probit regression rely on MCEM algorithms to avoid computationally intensive
evaluations of multivariate normal orthant probabilities. As an alternative to
the much used Gibbs sampler a new SMC sampler for truncated multivariate
normals is proposed. The algorithm proceeds in two stages where samples are
first drawn from truncated multivariate Student $t$ distributions and then
further evolved towards a Gaussian. The sampler is then embedded in a MCEM
algorithm. The sequential nature of SMC methods can be exploited to design a
fully sequential version of the EM, where the samples are simply updated from
one iteration to the next rather than resampled from scratch. Recycling the
samples in this manner significantly reduces the computational cost. An
alternative view of the standard conditional maximisation step provides the
basis for an iterative procedure to fully perform the maximisation needed in
the EM algorithm. The identifiability of MPM is also thoroughly discussed. In
particular, the likelihood invariance can be embedded in the EM algorithm to
ensure that constrained and unconstrained maximisation are equivalent. A simple
iterative procedure is then derived for either maximisation which takes
effectively no computational time. The method is validated by applying it to
the widely analysed Six Cities dataset and on a higher dimensional simulated
example. Previous approaches to the Six Cities overly restrict the parameter
space but, by considering the correct invariance, the maximum likelihood is
quite naturally improved when treating the full unrestricted model.

to extend the previous adiabatic study, exploring the consequences of radiative

approximation for radiatively damped propagation. The results indicate that the
mode conversion pathways identified in the adiabatic study are maintained in
the presence of damping. The wave energy fluxes are highly sensitive to the
form of the height dependence of the radiative damping time. While simulations
starting from 0.2 Mm result in modest flux attenuation compared to the
adiabatic results, short damping times expected in the low photosphere
effectively suppress gravity waves in simulations starting at the base of the
photosphere. It is difficult to reconcile our results and observations of
propagating gravity waves with significant energy flux at photospheric heights
unless they are generated in situ, and even then, why they are observed to be
propagating as low as 70 km where gravity waves should be radiatively

mass shift that depends only on the part of the energy density with no field

subexponential time algorithms unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.

and complex development are arguably the most mysterious. Although larval
echinoderms are bilaterally symmetric, the adult body seems to abandon the
larval body plan and to develop independently a new structure with different
symmetries. The prevalent pentamer structure, the asymmetry of Loven's rule and
the variable location of the periproct and madrepore present enormous
difficulties in homologizing structures across the major clades, despite the
excellent fossil record. This irregularity in body forms seems to place
echinoderms outside the other deuterostomes. Here I propose that the
predominant five-ray structure is derived from a hexamer structure that is
grounded directly in the structure of the bilaterally symmetric larva. This
hypothesis implies that the adult echinoderm body can be derived directly from
the larval bilateral symmetry and thus firmly ranks even the adult echinoderms
among the bilaterians. In order to test the hypothesis rigorously, a model is
developed in which one ray is missing between rays IV-V (Loven's schema) or
rays C-D (Carpenter's schema). The model is used to make predictions, which are
tested and verified for the process of metamorphosis and for the morphology of
recent and fossil forms. The theory provides fundamental insight into the
M-plane and the Ubisch', Loven's and Carpenter's planes and generalizes them
for all echinoderms. The theory also makes robust predictions about the

the ionization level in the foreground PDLA, and provides an interesting

  shortened abstract",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201117687",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modeling the formation of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune is a long-lasting
problem in planetary science. Due to gas-drag, collisional damping, and
resonant shepherding, the planetary embryos repel the planetesimals away from
their reach and thus they stop growing (Levison et al. 2010). This problem
persists independently of whether the accretion took place at the current
locations of the ice giants or closer to the Sun. Instead of trying to push the
runaway/oligarchic growth of planetary embryos up to 10-15 Earth masses, we
envision the possibility that the planetesimal disk could generate a system of
planetary embryos of only 1-3 Earth masses. Then we investigate whether these
embryos could have collided with each other and grown enough to reach the
masses of current Uranus and Neptune. Our results point to two major problems.
First, there is typically a large difference in mass between the first and the
second most massive core formed and retained beyond Saturn. Second, in many
simulations the final planetary system has more than two objects beyond Saturn.
The growth of a major planet from a system of embryos requires strong damping
of eccentricities and inclinations from the disk of gas. But strong damping
also favors embryos and cores to find a stable resonant configuration, so that
systems with more than two surviving objects are found. In addition to these
problems, in order to have substantial mutual accretion among embryos, it is
necessary to assume that the surface density of the gas was several times
higher than that of the minimum-mass solar nebula. However this contrasts with
the common idea that Uranus and Neptune formed in a gas-starving disk, which is
suggested by the relatively small amount of hydrogen and helium contained in
the atmospheres of these planets. Only one of our simulations ""by chance""
successfully reproduced the structure of the outer Solar System.

In order to study the association of the origin of ultra high energy

such a sample, of about 6 000 black holes, within the local Universe, inside
the GZK (Greisen Zatsepin Kuzmin) limit, around 100 Mpc. Methods. The starting
point is the 2 micron all sky survey, with the next steps as: test its com-
pleteness down to low flux densities, confine it to redshifts z < 0.025, limit
it to early Hubble type galaxies, test with B-V colors and with the FIR/Radio
ratio the possible separation in classes of sources for the ultra high energy
cosmic rays, use the spheroidal stellar component - black hole mass
relationship to derive black hole masses, and test them with known black hole
masses. Results. The statistics are consistent with the mass function of black
hole masses, with a rel- atively flat distribution to about 10^8 Msol, and
thereafter a very steep spectrum. Our sample cuts off just below 10^7 Msol,
indicating a gap for lower masses, below somewhere near 10^6 Msol. We construct
the sky distribution for all black holes above 10^7 Msol, 10^8 Msol, and 3 x

  Existence, Efficient Computation, and Structure","31 pages",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider structural and algorithmic questions related to the Nash dynamics
of weighted congestion games. In weighted congestion games with linear latency
functions, the existence of (pure Nash) equilibria is guaranteed by potential
function arguments. Unfortunately, this proof of existence is inefficient and
computing equilibria is such games is a {\sf PLS}-hard problem. The situation
gets worse when superlinear latency functions come into play; in this case, the
Nash dynamics of the game may contain cycles and equilibria may not even exist.
Given these obstacles, we consider approximate equilibria as alternative
solution concepts. Do such equilibria exist? And if so, can we compute them
efficiently?
  We provide positive answers to both questions for weighted congestion games
with polynomial latency functions by exploiting an ""approximation"" of such
games by a new class of potential games that we call $\Psi$-games. This allows
us to show that these games have $d!$-approximate equilibria, where $d$ is the
maximum degree of the latency functions. Our main technical contribution is an
efficient algorithm for computing O(1)-approximate equilibria when $d$ is a
constant. For games with linear latency functions, the approximation guarantee
is $\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}+O(\gamma)$ for arbitrarily small $\gamma>0$; for
latency functions with maximum degree $d\geq 2$, it is $d^{2d+o(d)}$. The
running time is polynomial in the number of bits in the representation of the
game and $1/\gamma$. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also show the
following structural statement for weighted congestion games with polynomial
latency functions of maximum degree $d\geq 2$: polynomially-long sequences of
best-response moves from any initial state to a $d^{O(d^2)}$-approximate
equilibrium exist and can be efficiently identified in such games as long as
$d$ is constant.

characterisation of the non-Gaussianity produced by radio point sources and by
infrared (IR) sources in the frequency range of the cosmic microwave background
from 30 to 350 GHz. We propose a simple prescription to infer the angular
bispectrum from the power spectrum of point sources considering independent
populations of sources, with or without clustering. We test the accuracy of our
prediction using publicly available all-sky simulations of radio and IR sources
and find very good agreement. We further characterise the configuration
dependence and the frequency behaviour of the IR and radio bispectra. We show
that the IR angular bispectrum peaks for squeezed triangles and that the
clustering of IR sources enhances the bispectrum values by several orders of
magnitude at scales l \sim 100. At 150 GHz the bispectrum of IR sources starts
to dominate that of radio sources on large angular scales, and it dominates
over the whole multipole range at 350 GHz. Finally, we compute the bias on f_NL
induced by radio and IR sources. We show that the positive bias induced by
radio sources is significantly reduced by masking the sources. We also show,
for the first time, that the form of the IR bispectrum mimics a primordial
'local' bispectrum f_NL. The IR sources produce a negative bias which becomes
important for Planck-like resolution and at high frequencies (Delta f_NL ~ -6
at 277 GHz and Delta f_NL \sim -60-70 at 350 GHz). Most of the signal being due
to the clustering of faint IR sources, the bias Delta f_NL^IR is not reduced by
masking sources above a flux limit and may, in some cases, even be increased
due to the reduction of the shot-noise term.

timelike splitting functions for the evolution of fragmentation functions in
perturbative QCD. These quantities have been derived by studying physical
evolution kernels for photon- and Higgs-exchange structure functions in deep
inelastic scattering and their counterparts in semi-inclusive annihilation,
together with constraints from the momentum sum rule and the supersymmetric
limit. For this purpose we have also calculated the second-order coefficient
functions for one-hadron inclusive Higgs decay in the heavy-top limit. A
numerically tolerable uncertainty remains for the quark-gluon splitting
function, which does not affect the endpoint logarithms for small and large
momentum fractions. We briefly discuss these limits and illustrate the
numerical impact of the third-order corrections. Compact and accurate
parametrizations are provided for all third-order timelike splitting functions.

to have strong CO emission. Clear detections in CN and HCO$^{+}$ transitions

account for the molecular observations. This conclusion is consistent with that
of \citet{Ferl09} in their study of gas traced by optical and infrared

empirical point of view the predictions of the ESR model depend on some

evolution models since they determine stellar evolution parameters such as
stellar spin-down and increase in stellar luminosity through the lifetime of a
star. Due to the lack of direct observations of stellar winds from Sun-like
stars stellar X-ray luminosity and stellar level of activity are commonly used
as a proxy for estimating stellar mass loss rates. However, such an intuitive
activity --- mass loss rate relation is not well defined. In this paper, I
study the mass loss rate of the Sun as a function of its activity level. I
compare in-situ solar wind measurements with the solar activity level
represented by the solar X-ray flux. I find no clear dependency of the solar
mass flux on solar X-ray flux. Instead, the solar mass loss rate is scattered
around an average value of $2\cdot10^{-14}\;M_\odot\;yr^{-1}$. This
independency of the mass loss rate on level of activity can be explained by the
fact that the activity level is governed by the large modulations in the solar
close magnetic flux, while the mass loss rate is governed by the rather
constant open magnetic flux. I derive a simple expression for stellar mass loss
rates as a function of the stellar ambient weak magnetic field, the stellar
radius, the stellar escape velocity, and the average height of the Alfv\'en
surface. This expression predicts stellar mass loss rates of
$10^{-15}-10^{-12}\;M_\odot\;yr^{-1}$ for Sun-like stars.

columnar ordering is found for intermediate Hund's coupling J_H. At smaller

Ferromagnetism appears at large J_H. Ferromagnetic correlations are enhanced
with electron doping while large hole doping stabilizes checkerboard
antiferromagnetism, explaining the change in magnetic interactions upon
substitution of Fe by Co or Mn. For intermediate and large values of U,
Hartree-Fock shows similar results as strong coupling though with a double

measured in preparation for a search for the eEDM. The small magnetic moment
$\mu_H = 8.5(5) \times 10^{-3} \ \mu_B$ displays the predicted cancellation of
spin and orbital contributions in a ${}^3 \Delta_1$ paramagnetic molecular
state, providing a significant advantage for the suppression of magnetic field
noise and related systematic effects in the eEDM search. In addition, the
induced electric dipole moment is shown to be fully saturated in very modest
electric fields ($<$ 10 V/cm). This feature is favorable for the suppression of
many other potential systematic errors in the ThO eEDM search experiment.

without clear signs of star formation. Aims: We investigate the dynamical
properties of the gas within the Coalsack. Methods: The two highest extinction
regions were mapped with the APEX telescope in 13CO(2-1) comprising a region of
~1 square degree. Results: In addition to the well-known, nearby gas component
around -4km/s, we identified additional molecular gas components - in
particular a second extended molecular cloud at a velocity of ~-30km/s and an
estimated distance of ~3.1kpc - that dominate the column density and visual
extinction distributions in the northeastern part of the Coalsack. Although
comprising ~2600Msun, the mass of this distant cloud is distributed over an
extent of ~73pc, much larger than typical high-mass infrared dark clouds. Its
filamentary structure is consistent with a compressible gaseous
self-gravitating cylinder, and its low mass per length indicates that it may be
stable against gravitational collapse. We find barely any mid-infrared emission
in archival MSX data, which is indicative of almost no star-formation activity
in the near and far cloud complexes. The nearby clouds have narrow, almost
thermal velocity dispersions with median values between 0.2 and 0.4km/s, which
is also consistent with low star-formation activity. Only Tapia's Globule 2
exhibits a velocity dispersion increase toward the extinction peak and
peak-velocity gradients over the core, which is indicative of a state of
elevated dynamical properties. Conclusions: The Coalsack is not one single
coherent structure, but consists of several cloud complexes nearby as well as
at several kpc distance. All studied clouds appear as starless low-turbulence
regions that may not even collapse in the future. Only one globule exhibits
more dynamical signatures and is a good candidate for present/future star
formation.

iBGP overlay in an Autonomous System (AS) in the Internet subject to a natural
notion of correctness derived from the standard ""hot-potato"" routing rules. For
both natural versions of the problem (where we measure the size of an overlay
by either the number of edges or the maximum degree) we prove that it is
NP-hard to approximate to a factor better than $\Omega(\log n)$ and provide
approximation algorithms with ratio $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$. In addition, we give
a slightly worse $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$-approximation based on primal-dual
techniques that has the virtue of being both fast and good in practice, which
we show via simulations on the actual topologies of five large Autonomous
Systems.
  The main technique we use is a reduction to a new connectivity-based network
design problem that we call Constrained Connectivity. In this problem we are
given a graph $G=(V,E)$, and for every pair of vertices $u,v \in V$ we are
given a set $S(u,v) \subseteq V$ called the safe set of the pair. The goal is
to find the smallest subgraph $H$ of $G$ in which every pair of vertices $u,v$
is connected by a path contained in $S(u,v)$. We show that the iBGP problem can
be reduced to the special case of Constrained Connectivity where $G = K_n$ and
safe sets are defined geometrically based on the IGP distances in the AS. We
also believe that Constrained Connectivity is an interesting problem in its own
right, so provide stronger hardness results ($2^{\log^{1-\epsilon} n}$-hardness
of approximation) and integrality gaps ($n^{1/3 - \epsilon}$) for the general
case. On the positive side, we show that Constrained Connectivity turns out to
be much simpler for some interesting special cases other than iBGP: when safe
sets are symmetric and hierarchical, we give a polynomial time algorithm that
computes an optimal solution.

is amazingly close to unity and strongly implies that this packing is maximally
dense. This construction is based on a generalized organizing principle for
polyhedra that lack central symmetry. Moreover, we find that the holes in this

of space by regular tetrahedra and truncated tetrahedra. We also numerically
study the equilibrium melting properties of what apparently is the densest

different sets of stellar templates, to re-assess the spectral resolution of
the MILES stellar library and models. We have also re-calibrated the zero-point
flux level of the models using a new calibration scheme. (Results) The end
result is an even more homogeneously calibrated stellar library than the
originally released one, with a measured spectral resolution of ~2.5\AA, almost
constant with wavelength, for both the MILES stellar library and models.
Furthermore, the new absolute flux calibration for the spectra excellently
agrees with predictions based on independent photometric libraries.

by a core-collapse supernova, can lead to self-induced neutrino flavor
conversions. While this is a nonlinear phenomenon, the onset of these
conversions can be examined through a standard stability analysis of the
linearized equations of motion. The problem is reduced to a linear eigenvalue
equation that involves the neutrino density, energy spectrum, angular
distribution, and matter density. In the single-angle case, we reproduce
previous results and use them to identify two generic instabilities: The system
is stable above a cutoff density (""cutoff mode""), or can approach an asymptotic
instability for increasing density (""saturation mode""). We analyze multi-angle
effects on these generic types of instabilities and find that even the
saturation mode is suppressed at large densities. For both types of modes, a
given multi-angle spectrum typically is unstable when the neutrino and electron
densities are comparable, but stable when the neutrino density is much smaller
or much larger than the electron density. The role of an instability in the SN
context depends on the available growth time and on the range of affected
modes. At large matter density, most modes are off-resonance even when the
system is unstable.

The first one is to perform a set of gravitation experiments at the Solar
System scale. Experimental tests of gravitation have always shown good
agreement with General Relativity. There are however drivers to continue
testing General Relativity, and to do so at the largest possible scales. From a
theoretical point of view, Einstein's theory of gravitation shows
inconsistencies with a quantum description of Nature and unified theories
predict deviations from General Relativity. From an observational point of
view, as long as dark matter and dark energy are not observed through other
means than their gravitational effects, they can be considered as a
manifestation of a modification of General Relativity at cosmic scales. The
scientific objectives are to: (i) test the gravitation law at the Solar System
scale; (ii) measure the Eddington parameter; and (iii) investigate the
navigation anomalies during fly-bys. To fulfil these objectives, the following
components are to be on board the spacecraft: (i) the Gravity Advanced Package
(GAP), which is an electrostatic accelerometer to which a rotating stage is
added; (ii) radio-science; (iii) laser ranging, to improve significantly the
measure of the Eddington parameter. The second set of objectives is to enhance
our knowledge of Neptune and Triton. Several instruments dedicated to
planetology are foreseen: camera, spectrometer, dust and particle detectors,
and magnetometer. Depending on the ones kept, the mission could provide
information on the gravity field, the atmosphere and the magnetosphere of the
two bodies as well as on the surface geology of Triton and on the nature of the
planetary rings around Neptune.

determining those structures of the fully deformed pencils that are inherited
through the interaction between structural properties of the dispersionless
pencils (in particular exactness or homogeneity) and suitable finiteness
conditions on the central invariants (like polynomiality). This approach
enables us to gain some information about each term of the deformation to all
orders in $\epsilon$. Concretely, we show that deformations of exact Poisson
pencils of hydrodynamic type with polynomial central invariants can be put, via
a Miura transformation, in a special form, that provides us with a tool to map
a fully deformed Poisson pencil with polynomial central invariants of a given
degree to a fully deformed Poisson pencil with constant central invariants to
all orders in $\epsilon$. In particular, this construction is applied to the so
called $r$-KdV-CH hierarchy that encompasses all known examples with
non-constant central invariants. As far as homogeneous Poisson pencils of
hydrodynamic type is concerned, we prove that they can also be put in a special
form, if the central invariants are homogeneous polynomials. Through this we
can compute the homogeneity degree about the tensorial component appearing in
each order in $\epsilon$, namely the coefficient of the highest order
derivative of the $\delta$.

structures. Field-dependent studies showed that the onset and nature of this
structural transition can be controlled with an applied magnetic field, and
revealed evidence for a field-tuned quantum phase transition to a tetragonal
spin-disordered phase for H||[1-10]. Pressure-dependent Raman measurements
showed that the magnetic easy axis direction in Mn3O4 can be controlled---and
the ferrimagnetic transition temperature increased---with applied pressure.
Finally, combined pressure- and magnetic-field-tuned Raman measurements
revealed a rich magnetostructural phase diagram---including a pressure- and
field-induced magnetically frustrated tetragonal phase in the PH phase
diagram---that can be generated in Mn3O4 with applied pressure and magnetic
field.

networks relies on finding the configurations of fluxes and chemical potentials
satisfying stoichiometric (mass balance) and thermodynamic (energy balance)
constraints. Efficient methods to explore such states are crucial to predict
reaction directionality, calculate physiologic ranges of variability, estimate
correlations, and reconstruct the overall energy balance of the network from
the underlying molecular processes. While different techniques for sampling the
space generated by mass balance constraints are currently available,
thermodynamics is generically harder to incorporate. Here we introduce a method
to sample the free energy landscape of a reaction network at steady state. In
its most general form, it allows to calculate distributions of fluxes and
concentrations starting from trial functions that may contain prior biochemical
information. We apply our method to the human red blood cell's metabolic
network, whose space of mass-balanced flux states has been sampled extensively
in recent years. Specifically, we profile its thermodynamically feasible flux
configurations, characterizing in detail how fluctuations of fluxes and
potentials are correlated. Based on this, we derive the cell's energy balance
in terms of entropy production, chemical work done and thermodynamic
efficiency.

generalizations and extra-utilities to the tools for free-form design schemes.
Unfortunately, such advantages are often overshadowed by the complexity of the
resulting algorithms. In this work, we show that for the case of Muntz spaces
with integer exponents, the notion of Chebyshev blossom leads to elegant
algorithms whose complexities are embedded in the combinatorics of Schur
functions. We express the blossom and the pseudo-affinity property in Muntz
spaces in term of Schur functions. We derive an explicit expression of the
Chebyshev-Bernstein basis via an inductive argument on nested Muntz spaces. We
also reveal a simple algorithm for the dimension elevation process. Free-form
design schemes in Muntz spaces with Young diagrams as shape parameter will be
discussed.
