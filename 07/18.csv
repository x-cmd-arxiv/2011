Since most
renewable sources are intermittent in nature, it is a challenging task to
integrate renewable energy resources into the power grid infrastructure. In
this grid integration, communication systems are crucial technologies, which
enable the accommodation of distributed renewable energy generation and play
extremely important role in monitoring, operating, and protecting both
renewable energy generators and power systems. In this paper, we review some
communication technologies available for grid integration of renewable energy
resources. Then, we present the communication systems used in a real renewable
energy project, Bear Mountain Wind Farm (BMW) in British Columbia, Canada. In
addition, we present the communication systems used in Photovoltaic Power
Systems (PPS). Finally, we outline some research challenges and possible
solutions about the communication systems for grid integration of renewable
energy resources.

interest in its own right. In addition, the fact that molecular hydrogen plays
a key role in the formation of the first stars and galaxies means that if we
want to understand the formation of these objects, we must first develop a good
understanding of the chemical evolution of the gas. In this review, I first
give a brief introduction to the chemistry occurring in the gas prior to the
formation of the first stars and galaxies, and then go on to discuss in more
detail the main chemical processes occurring during the gravitational collapse
of gas from intergalactic to protostellar densities, and how these processes

manifold (with corners) is an important tool for resolving singularities,
degeneracies and competing notions of homogeneity. These constructions are
shown to be particular cases of `generalized boundary blow-up' in which a new
manifold and blow-down map are constructed from, and conversely determine,
combinatorial data at the boundary faces in the form of a refinement of the
`basic monoidal complex' of the manifold. This data specifies which notion of
homogeneity is realized at each of the boundary hypersurfaces in the blown-up
space.
  As an application of this theory, the existence of fiber products is examined
for the natural smooth maps in this context, the b-maps. Transversality of the
b-differentials is shown to ensure that the set-theoretic fiber product of two
maps is a `binomial variety'. Properties of these (extrinsically defined)
spaces, which generalize manifolds but have mild singularities at the boundary,
are investigated and a condition on the basic monoidal complex is found under
which the variety has a smooth structure. Applied to b-maps this additional
condition with transversality leads to a universal fiber product in the context
of manifolds with corners. Under the transversality condition alone the fiber
product is resolvable to a smooth manifold by generalized blow-up and then has
a weaker form of the universal mapping property requiring blow-up of the
domain.

After using the general relativistic expression for the electromagnetic scalar
potential in the magnetar magnetosphere, we find that larger compactness
parameters of the star as well as larger inclination angles between the
rotation axis and the magnetic moment produce death-lines well above the
majority of known magnetars. This is consistent with the observational evidence
of no regular radio emission from the magnetars in the frequency range typical
for the ordinary pulsars. On the contrary, when oscillations of the magnetar
are taken into account, the death-lines shift downward and the conditions
necessary for the generation of radio emission in the magnetosphere are met.
Present observations showing a close connection between the burst activity of
magnetars and the generation of the radio emission in the magnetar

the phase space. But, in contrast with standard relaxation dynamics (of van der

from slow to fast dynamics occurs because the slow dynamics has a finite time
singularity breaking the assumption of slowness. This makes a new kind of

melts using molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis involves constructing
Voronoi tessellations in the equilibrated configurations of the polymeric
melts. In this work, we focus on the effects of temperature and polymer
backbone rigidity on the packing. We found that the Voronoi polyhedra near the
chain ends are of higher volumes than those constructed around the other sites
along the backbone. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the backbone rigidity
(tuned by fixing the bond angles) affect the Voronoi cell distribution in a
significant manner, especially at lower temperatures. For the melts consisting
of chains with fixed bond angles, the Voronoi cell distribution was found to be
wider than that for the freely jointed chains without any angular restrictions.
As the temperature is increased, the effect of backbone rigidity on the Voronoi
cell distributions diminishes and becomes similar to that of the freely jointed
chains. Demonstrated dependencies of the distribution of the Voronoi cell
volumes on the nature of the polymers are argued to be important for
efficiently designing the polymeric materials for various energy applications.

extends over 6-10 kpc in 4 galaxies, resolved compact emission (r<3 kpc) is
detected in 5 galaxies, and extended regions of Halpha emission are observed in

G.
  We show that for a fixed non-trivial group word w and large enough G we have
w(G)^3=G, namely every element of G is a product of 3 values of w. For various
families of finite quasisimple groups, including covers of alternating groups,
we obtain a stronger result, namely w(G)^2=G. However, in contrast with the
case of simple groups, we show that w(G)^2 need not equal G for all large G. If

expectancy. Using the radiances observed by NASA's Multi-angle Imaging

Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at a spatial resolution of 17.6 km x 17.6 km. A
systematic study of aerosols and their impact on public health, especially in
highly-populated urban areas, requires a finer-resolution estimate of the

  We embed MISR's operational weighted least squares criterion and its forward
simulations for AOD retrieval in a likelihood framework and further expand it
into a Bayesian hierarchical model to adapt to a finer spatial scale of 4.4 km
x 4.4 km. To take advantage of AOD's spatial smoothness, our method borrows
strength from data at neighboring pixels by postulating a Gaussian Markov
Random Field prior for AOD. Our model considers both AOD and aerosol mixing
vectors as continuous variables. The inference of AOD and mixing vectors is
carried out using Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling methods. Retrieval
uncertainties are quantified by posterior variabilities. We also implement a
parallel MCMC algorithm to reduce computational cost. We assess our retrievals
performance using ground-based measurements from the AErosol RObotic NETwork

package, gDPM v2.0. It utilizes the parallel computation ability of a GPU to
achieve high efficiency, while maintaining the same particle transport physics
as in the original DPM code and hence the same level of simulation accuracy. In
GPU computing, divergence of execution paths between threads can considerably
reduce the efficiency. Since photons and electrons undergo different physics
and hence attain different execution paths, we use a simulation scheme where
photon transport and electron transport are separated to partially relieve the
thread divergence issue. High performance random number generator and hardware
linear interpolation are also utilized. We have also developed various
components to handle fluence map and linac geometry, so that gDPM can be used
to compute dose distributions for realistic IMRT or VMAT treatment plans. Our
gDPM package is tested for its accuracy and efficiency in both phantoms and
realistic patient cases. In all cases, the average relative uncertainties are
less than 1%. A statistical t-test is performed and the dose difference between

structures that look morphologically different from usual bright-rimmed clouds
(BRCs). Of particular interest is a concentration of thin and long elephant
trunk-like structures in the southeastern part of IC 1848E. Some of them have
an apparently associated star (or two stars) at their very tip. We conducted
$VI_{c}$ photometry of several of these stars. Their positions on the
$V/(V-I_{c})$ color-magnitude diagram as well as the physical parameters
obtained by SED fittings indicate that they are low-mass pre-main-sequence
stars having ages of mostly one Myr or less. This strongly suggests that they
formed from elongated, elephant trunk-like clouds. We presume that such
elephant trunk-like structures are genetically different from BRCs, on the
basis of the differences in morphology, size distributions, and the ages of the
associated young stars. We suspect that those clouds have been caused by
hydrodynamical instability of the ionization/shock front of the expanding HII
region. Similar structures often show up in recent numerical simulations of the
evolution of HII regions. We further hypothesize that this mechanism makes a
third mode of triggered star formation associated with HII regions, in addition
to the two known mechanisms, i.e., collect-and-collapse of the shell
accumulated around an expanding HII region and radiation-driven implosion of
BRCs originated from pre-existing cloud clumps.

the order book, that generalizes previous work on the impact of market orders.
Two different modeling routes can be considered, which are equivalent when only
market orders are taken into account. One model posits that each event type has
a temporary impact (TIM). The ""history dependent impact"" model (HDIM), on the
other hand, assumes that only price-changing events have a direct impact,
itself modulated by the past history of all events through an ""influence
matrix"" that measures how much, on average, an event of a given type affects
the immediate impact of a price-changing event of the same sign in the future.
We find in particular that aggressive market orders tend to reduce the impact
of further aggressive market orders of the same sign (and increase the impact
of aggressive market orders of opposite sign). We discuss the relative merits
of TIM and HDIM, in particular concerning their ability to reproduce accurately
the price diffusion pattern. We find that in spite of theoretical
inconsistencies, TIM appears to fare better than HDIM when compared to
empirical data. We ascribe this paradox to an uncontrolled approximation used
to calibrate HDIMs, calling for further work on this issue.

model (MUED) and improve it utilizing the multijet + lepton mode at the LHC.
Since the MUED has a nearly degenerate spectrum, most events only have soft
jets and small Emiss. The signature is challenging to search. We apply MT2 for
the event selection and set the invisible particle mass of MT2 (test mass) to
zero. The test mass is much smaller than the invisible particle mass of MUED.
In that case, MT2 of the signal can be large depending on Up-Stream Radiations
(USR) which includes initial state radiations (ISR). On the other hand, MT2 of
the background is mainly below the top quark mass. Hence, the signal is
extracted from the background in the high MT2 region. Since we use the leading
jets for MT2, there is a combinatorics effect. We found the effect also
enhances the signal to background ratio for high MT2. We perform a detailed
simulation with the Matrix Element correction to the QCD radiations. The
discovery potential of the MUED is improved by the MT2 cut, and especially, the
improvement is significant for the most degenerate parameter we consider,
{\Lambda}R = 10.

in the GeV photon energy range; a detailed look at the temporal characteristics
of the observed gamma-ray emission reveals in addition possible flux
variability in both sources. No statistically significant gamma-ray detection
of the other BLRGs was however found in the considered dataset. Though the
sample size studied is small, what appears to differentiate 3C 111 and 3C 120
from the BLRGs not yet detected in gamma-rays is the particularly strong
nuclear radio flux. This finding, together with the indications of the
gamma-ray flux variability and a number of other arguments presented, indicate
that the GeV emission of BLRGs is most likely dominated by the beamed radiation
of relativistic jets observed at intermediate viewing angles. In this paper we
also analyzed a comparison sample of high accretion-rate Seyfert 1 galaxies,
which can be considered radio-quiet counterparts of BLRGs, and found none were
detected in gamma-rays. A simple phenomenological hybrid model applied for the
broad-band emission of the discussed radio-loud and radio-quiet type 1 active
galaxies suggests that the relative contribution of the nuclear jets to the
accreting matter is > 1 percent on average for BLRGs, whilst <0.1 percent for
Seyfert 1 galaxies.

state. However, despite impressive experimental results confirming the
existence of the quantum spin Hall state, the quantum spin Hall effect has not
yet been detected. After a short overview of what was originally suggested as
the quantum spin Hall effect (quantum spin conductance determined by the
topological Chern number) the paper analyzes the crucial role of the boundary
condition on the observation of the effect and finally discusses whether and
how the quantum spin Hall effect could be observed.

coefficients have the Yukawa type corrections with respect to the usual
Newtonian gravitational potential. The inverse square law experiments restrict
the parameters of the model: $a/\sqrt{\omega_1}\lesssim 6\times10^{-3}\

parameter $\gamma$ is equal to 1 with very high accuracy. Thus, our model
satisfies the gravitational experiments (the deflection of light and the time
delay of radar echoes) at the same level of accuracy as General Relativity. We
demonstrate also that our background matter provides the stable
compactification of the internal space in the case $\omega_1>0$. However, if

dynamics of large-scale waves at the rapidly rotating stellar tachoclines in
the presence of toroidal magnetic field. Dispersion relations and latitudinal

Rossby waves tend to be located at poles, but high-frequency magnetic Poincare
waves are concentrated near the equator in rapidly rotating stars. These
results have important implications for the evolution of the stellar wind in

enhancement of magnetic flux at high latitudes of tachoclines in rapidly

magnetic buoyancy in the form of tubes and appear as starspots at polar

  Our algorithms have been programmed as new modules for the Kenzo system,

  - construction of the effective homology of K(G,1) from a given finite free

  - construction of the effective homology of K(A,1) for every finitely

the [NeV], [OIV], [NeIII], and [SIV] lines, whose fluxes correlate well with
each other, to probe gas photoionized by the AGN. We found that the widths of
the lines are, on average, increasing with the ionization potential of the
species that emit them. No correlation of the line width with the critical
density of the corresponding transition was found. The velocity dispersion of
the gas, sigma, is systematically higher than that of the stars, sigma_*, in
the AGN host galaxy, and it scales with the mass of the central black hole,
M_BH. Further correlations between the line widths and luminosities L, and
between L and M_BH, are suggestive of a three dimensional plane connecting
log(M_BH) to a linear combination of log(sigma) and log(L). Such a plane can be
understood within the context of gas motions that are driven by AGN feedback
mechanisms, or virialized gas motions with a power-law dependence of the NLR

higher angular resolution of these surveys compared to previous studies (e.g.,
the Leiden Dwingeloo Survey), we resolve Complex GCN into lots of individual
tiny clumps, that mostly have relatively broad line widths of more than 15
km/s. We do not detect a diffuse extended counterpart, which is unusual for an
HVC complex. In total 243 clumps were identified and parameterized which allows
us to statistically analyze the data. Cold-line components (i.e., w < 7.5 km/s)
are found in about 5% only of the identified cloudlets. Our analysis reveals
that Complex GCN is likely built up of several subpopulations that do not share
a common origin. Furthermore, Complex GCN might be a prime example for warm-gas
accretion onto the Milky Way, where neutral HI clouds are not stable against
interaction with the Milky Way gas halo and become ionized prior to accretion.

comparison to the data of the NA60 Collaboration shows that the measured

radiation of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) via off-shell
quark-antiquark annihilation, quark annihilation with additional gluon
Bremsstrahlung and the gluon-Compton scattering mechanisms. In particular, the
spectra in the intermediate mass range (1 GeV < M < 2.5 GeV) are dominated by
quark-antiquark annihilation in the nonperturbative QGP. Also, the observed
softening of the transverse mass spectra at intermediate masses (1 GeV < M <
2.5 GeV) is approximately reproduced. Furthermore, for dileptons of low masses
(M < 0.6 GeV), we find a sizable contribution from the quark annihilation with
additional gluon bremsstrahlung, thus providing another possible window for
probing the properties of the sQGP.

framework of point stochastic processes. The neuron receives excitatory input
impulses from a Poisson stream, and inhibitory impulses from the feedback line
with a delay. We investigate here, how does the presence of inhibitory feedback
affect the output firing statistics. Using binding neuron (BN) as a model, we
derive analytically the exact expressions for the output interspike intervals
(ISI) probability density, mean output ISI and coefficient of variation as
functions of model's parameters for the case of threshold 2. Using the leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) model, as well as the BN model with higher thresholds,
these statistical quantities are found numerically. In contrast to the
previously studied situation of no feedback, the ISI probability densities
found here both for BN and LIF neuron become bimodal and have discontinuity of
jump type. Nevertheless, the presence of inhibitory delayed feedback was not
found to affect substantially the output ISI coefficient of variation. The ISI
coefficient of variation found ranges between 0.5 and 1. It is concluded that
introduction of delayed inhibitory feedback can radically change neuronal
output firing statistics. This statistics is as well distinct from what was
found previously (Vidybida & Kravchuk, 2009) by a similar method for excitatory
neuron with delayed feedback.

reached ~5.14 Crab in the 15-50 keV range. Unfortunately, due to Sun
constraints it could not be observed by most X-ray satellites. The outburst was
preceded by four weaker outbursts associated with the periastron passage of the
neutron star. The fourth of them, in August 2009, presented a peculiar
double-peaked light curve, with a first peak lasting about 9 days that reached
a (15-50 keV) flux of 440 mCrab. The flux then decreased to less than 220
mCrab, and increased again reaching 440 Crab around the periastron. The
outburst was monitored with INTEGRAL, RXTE, and Suzaku TOO observations. One
orbital period (~111 days) after the 2009 giant outburst, a new and
unexpectedly bright outburst took place (~1.4Crab in the 15-50 keV range). It
was monitored with TOO obs ervations with INTEGRAL, RXTE, Suzaku, and Swift.
First results of the spectral and timing analysis of these observations are
presented, with a specific focus on the cyclotron lines present in the system
and its variation with the mass accretion rate.

the state-of-the-art model of da Cunha (2008) we can accurately calculate their
mass, SFR, and extinction, as well as estimate their infrared luminosity and
dust content. We compare our findings with samples of field galaxies,
early-stage interacting pairs, and cluster galaxies with similar data. We find
that classifying the groups as dynamically ""old"" or ""young"", depending on
whether or not at least one quarter of their members are early-type systems, is
physical and consistent with past classifications of HCGs based on their atomic
gas content. [...ABRIDGED...] We also examine their SF properties, UV-optical
and mid-IR colors, and we conclude that all the evidence point to an
evolutionary scenario in which the effects of the group environment and the
properties of the galaxy members are not instantaneous. Early on, the influence
of close companions to group galaxies is similar to the one of galaxy pairs in
the field. However, as the time progresses, the effects of tidal torques and
minor merging, shape the morphology and star formation history of the group
galaxies, leading to an increase of the fraction of early-type members and a
rapid built up of the stellar mass in the remaining late-type galaxies.

so on. But probability cannot be defined within QM-A. Nevertheless, because of
its astonishing success, it seems reasonable to require (1) that the
mathematics of an interpretation be limited to the highly successful QM-A and
(2) that ""matter"" be composed of state vectors alone. But the probability law
requires, in essence, that one version of the observer be singled out. The most
straightforward way to accomplish this under (1) and (2) is to assume there is
an aspect of the observer-the Mind-which is outside the laws of quantum
mechanics and perceives just one version of reality. Under that assumption, the

a position detection system to track the motion of the probe. Signal collection
for motion detection is often carried out using the backscattered light off the
probe - however, this mode has problems of low S/N due to the small
back-scattering cross-sections of the micro-probes typically used. The position
sensors often used in these cases are quadrant photodetectors. To ensure
maximum sensitivity of such detectors, it would help if the detector size
matched with the detection beam radius after the condenser lens (which for
backscattered detection would be the trapping objective itself). To suit this
condition, we have used a miniature displacement sensor whose dimensions makes
it ideal to work with 1:1 images of micron-sized trapped probes in the
back-scattering detection mode. The detector is based on the quadrant photo-IC
in the optical pick-up head of a compact disc player. Using this detector, we
measured absolute displacements of an optically trapped 1.1 um probe with a
resolution of ~10 nm for a bandwidth of 10 Hz at 95% significance without any
sample or laser stabilization. We characterized our optical trap for different
sized probes by measuring the power spectrum for each probe to 1% accuracy, and
found that for 1.1 um diameter probes, the noise in our position measurement
matched the thermal resolution limit for averaging times up to 10 ms. We also
achieved a linear response range of around 385 nm with crosstalk between axes
~4% for 1.1 um diameter probes. The detector has extremely high bandwidth (few
MHz) and low optical power threshold - other factors that can lead to it's
widespread use in photonic force microscopy.

conducting fluid submitted to a uniform magnetic field, for low magnetic
Reynolds number, in the quasi- static approximation. We interpret disagreeing
previous predictions between linearized theory and simulations: in the linear
limit, the kinetic energy of transverse velocity components, normal to the
magnetic field, decays faster than the kinetic energy of the axial component,
along the magnetic field (Moffatt (1967)); whereas many numerical studies
predict a final state characterised by dominant energy of transverse velocity
components. We investigate the corresponding nonlinear phenomenon using Direct
Numerical Simulations of freely-decaying turbulence, and a two-point
statistical spectral closure based on the Eddy Damped Quasi-Normal Markovian
model. The transition from the three-dimensional turbulent flow to a
""two-and-a-half-dimensional"" flow (Montgomery & Turner (1982)) is a result of
the combined effects of short-time linear Joule dissipation and longer time
nonlinear creation of polarisation anisotropy. It is this combination of linear
and nonlinear effects which explains the disagreement between predictions from
linearized theory and results from numerical simulations. The transition is
characterized by the elongation of turbulent structures along the applied
magnetic field, and by the strong anisotropy of directional two-point
correlation spectra, in agreement with experimental evidence. Inertial
equatorial transfers in both DNS and the model are presented to describe in
detail the most important equilibrium dynamics. Spectral scalings are
maintained in high Reynolds number turbulence attainable only with the EDQNM

focus especially on the evolution of the free magnetic energy, the location of
the excess of energy, and the distribution of electric currents in the corona.
For this purpose, we use an idealised active region characterised by four main
polarities and a satellite polarity allowing us to specify a complex topology
and sheared arcades to the coronal magnetic field but no twisted flux bundles.
We investigate the changes in the geometry and connectivity of field lines, the
magnetic energy and current density content as well as the evolution of null
points. Increasing the photospheric current density in the magnetic
configuration does not dramatically change the energy-storage processes within
the active region even if the magnetic topology is slightly modified. We
conclude that for reasonable values of the photospheric current density (the
force-free parameter alpha < 0.25 Mm-1), the magnetic configurations studied do
change but not dramatically: i) the original null point stays nearly at the
same location, ii) the field-line geometry and connectivity are slightly
modified, iii) even if the free magnetic energy is significantly increased, the
energy storage happens at the same location. This extensive study of different
force-free models for a simple magnetic configuration shows that some
topological elements of an observed active region, such as null points, can be
reproduced with confidence only by considering the potential-field
approximation. This study is a preliminary work aiming at understanding the
effects of electric currents generated by characteristic photospheric motions
on the structure and evolution of the coronal magnetic field.

one of 5 types of which four, L, N, P/Q and R were said to be high threshold

aspects of L-type currents. L-type channels are now distinguished according to
their structure as one of four main subtypes 1.1-1.4. L-type calcium currents
play many fundamental roles in cellular dynamical processes including
pacemaking in neurons and cardiac cells, the activation of transcription
factors involved in synaptic plasticity and in immune cells. The
half-activation potentials of L-type currents have been ascribed values as low
as -50 mV and as high as near 0 mV. The inactivation of I_L has been found to
be both voltage (VDI) and calcium-dependent (CDI) and the latter component may
involve calcium-induced calcium release. CDI is often an important aspect of
dynamical models of cell electrophysiology. We describe the basic components in
modeling I_L including activation and both voltage and calcium dependent
inactivation and the two main approaches to determining the current. We review,
by means of tables of values from over 65 representative studies, the various
details of the dynamical properties associated with I_L that have been found
experimentally or employed in the last 25 years in deterministic modeling in
various nervous system and cardiac cells. Distributions and statistics of
several parameters related to activation and inactivation are obtained. There
are few reliable experimental data on L-type calcium current kinetics for cells

attempt to describe nature within classical physics requires the presence of
Lorentz-invariant classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation so as to
account for the Casimir forces between parallel conducting plates at low
temperatures. Furthermore, conformal symmetry carries solutions of Maxwell's
equations into solutions. In an inertial frame, conformal symmetry leaves
zero-point radiation invariant and does not connect it to non-zero-temperature;
time-dilating conformal transformations carry the Lorentz-invariant zero-point
radiation spectrum into zero-point radiation and carry the thermal radiation
spectrum at non-zero temperature into thermal radiation at a different
non-zero-temperature. However, in a non-inertial frame, a time-dilating
conformal transformation carries classical zero-point radiation into thermal
radiation at a finite non-zero-temperature. By taking the no-acceleration
limit, one can obtain the Planck radiation spectrum for blackbody radiation in
an inertial frame from the thermal radiation spectrum in an accelerating frame.
Here this connection between zero-point radiation and thermal radiation is
illustrated for a scalar radiation field in a Rindler frame undergoing
relativistic uniform proper acceleration through flat spacetime in two
spacetime dimensions. The analysis indicates that the Planck radiation spectrum
for thermal radiation follows from zero-point radiation and the structure of
relativistic spacetime in classical physics.

encircling it gives rise to the Berry phase. Without the RWA, the conical
intersection is absent and therefore the Berry phase vanishes. It is believed
that this is a first example showing how the application of the RWA in the

a negative curvature (U-shape) sitting at the bottom of a cavity. The cavity is
located just above the polar crown filament material. We thus observe the inner
part of the cavity above the filament as depicted in the classical three part
Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) model composed of a filament, a cavity and a CME
front. The filament (in this case a polar crown filament) is part of the cavity
and makes a continuous structuring from the filament to the CME front depicted

cavity as a density depletion sitting above denser polar crown filament plasma
drained down the cavity due to gravity. As part of the polar crown filament,
plasma at different temperatures (ranging from 50000K to 0.6 MK) is observed at

the surface genus which, for example, produces significant changes in the
degree distribution and in the clustering coefficient. The global properties of
the graph are also strongly affected by the surface genus which is constraining
the degree of interwoveness, changing the scaling properties from
large-world-kind (small genus) to small- and ultra-small-world-kind (large
genus). Two elementary moves allow the exploration of all networks embeddable

(the spacetime), the leaf space of codimension-1 foliations (related to
noncommutative algebras) and quantization. At first we relate a small exotic
R^4 to codimension-1 foliations of the 3-sphere unique up to foliated
cobordisms and characterized by the real-valued Godbillon-Vey invariant.
Special care is taken for the integer case which is related to flat
PSL(2,R)-$bundles. Then we discuss the leaf space of the foliation using
noncommutative geometry. This leaf space contains the hyperfinite III_1 factor
of Araki and Woods important for quantum field theory (QFT) and the I_{\infty}
factor. Using Tomitas modular theory, one obtains a relation to a factor
II_{\infty} algebra given by the horocycle foliation of the unit tangent bundle
of a surface S of genus g>1. The relation to the exotic R^4 is used to
construct the (classical) observable algebra as Poisson algebra of functions
over the character variety of representations of the fundamental group
\pi_{1}(S) into the SL(2,C). The Turaev-Drinfeld quantization (as deformation
quantization) of this Poisson algebra is a (complex) skein algebra which is
isomorphic to the hyperfinite factor II_{1} algebra determining the factor
II_{\infty}=II_{1}\otimes I_{\infty} algebra of the horocycle foliation.
Therefore our geometrically motivated hyperfinite III_1 factor algebra comes
from the quantization of a Poisson algebra. Finally we discuss the states and
operators to be knots and knot concordances, respectively.

  standard model","19 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the standard three-component differential equation model for the
growth of an HIV virion population in an infected host in the absence of drug
therapy. The dynamical properties of the model are determined by the set of
values of six parameters which vary across host populations. There may be one
or two critical points whose natures play a key role in determining the outcome
of infection and in particular whether the HIV population will persist or
become extinct. There are two cases which may arise. In the first case, there
is only one critical point P_1 at biological values and this is an
asymptotically stable node. The system ends up with zero virions and so the
host becomes HIV-free. In the second case, there are two critical points P_1
and P_2 at biological values. Here P_1 is an unstable saddle point and P_2 is
an asymptotically stable spiral point with a non-zero virion level. In this
case the HIV population persists unless parameters change. We let the parameter
values take random values from distributions based on empirical data, but
suitably truncated, and determine the probabilities of occurrence of the
various combinations of critical points. From these simulations the probability
that an HIV infection will persist, across a population, is estimated. It is
found that with conservatively estimated distributions of parameters, within
the framework of the standard 3-component model, the chances that a within host
HIV population will become extinct is between 0.6% and 6.9%. With less
conservative parameter estimates, the probability is estimated to be as high as
24%. The many factors related to the transmission and possible spontaneous
elimination of the virus are discussed.

which are believed to be the result of the pollution of an otherwise normal
star by material from an evolved companion on the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB). We aim to derive carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine abundances for
the first time from the infrared spectra of the barium red giant star HD 123396
to quantitatively test AGB nucleosynthesis models for producing barium stars
via mass accretion. High-resolution and high S/N infrared spectra were obtained
using the Phoenix spectrograph mounted at the Gemini South telescope. The
abundances were obtained through spectrum synthesis of individual atomic and
molecular lines, using the MOOG stellar line analysis program, together with
Kurucz's stellar atmosphere models. The analysis was classical, using 1D
stellar models and spectral synthesis under the assumption of local
thermodynamic equilibrium. We confirm that HD 123396 is a metal-deficient
barium star ([Fe/H] = -1.05), with A(C) = 7.88, A(N) = 6.65, A(O) = 7.93, and
A(Na) = 5.28 on a logarithmic scale where A(H) = 12, leading to [(C+N)/Fe] ~
0.5. The A(CNO) group, as well as the A(Na) abundances, is in excellent
agreement with those previously derived for this star using high resolution
optical data. We also found A(F) = 4.16, which implies [F/O] = 0.39, a value
that is substantially higher than the F abundances measured in globular
clusters of a similar metallicity, noting that there are no F measurements in
field stars of comparable metallicity. The observed abundance pattern of the
light elements (CNO, F and Na) recovered here as well as the heavy elements
(s-process) studied elsewhere suggest that the surface composition of HD 123396
is well fitted by the predicted abundance pattern of a 1.5Msun AGB model star
with Z = 0.001.

yet it is of crucial importance for the modeling of planet formation, disk
chemistry, radiative transfer and observations. The initial growth of dust from
sub-micron sized grains to planetesimals and also the radial transport of dust
in disks around young stars is the topic of this thesis. Circumstellar dust is
subject to radial drift, vertical settling, turbulent mixing, collisional
growth, fragmentation and erosion.
  We approach this subject from three directions: analytical calculations,
numerical simulations, and comparison to observations. We describe the physical
and numerical concepts that go into a model which is able to simulate the
radial and size evolution of dust in a gas disk which is viscously evolving
over several million years. The resulting dust size distributions are compared
to our analytical predictions and a simple recipe for obtaining steady-state
dust size distributions is derived. With the numerical model at hand, we show
that grain fragmentation can explain the fact that circumstellar disks are
observed to be dust-rich for several million years. Finally, we investigate the
challenges that observations present to the theory of grain evolution, namely
that grains of millimeter sizes are observed at large distances from the star.
We have found that under the assumption that radial drift is ineffective, we
can reproduce some of the observed spectral indices and fluxes. Fainter objects
point towards a reduced dust-to-gas ratio or lower dust opacities.

Rev. B83. 165210 (2011)] has
shown need for correction and modification of current implementation of the k.p
method and operator ordering scheme using the interaction parameters defined
under double group consideration. This manuscript examines the difference in
treatment of spin-orbit interaction under the single and double group
formulations. We show that the restriction to the adapted double group bases,
brought about by the imposition of single group selection rule in calculating
the k.p interaction, is not appropriate. In addition, the unitary
transformation employed in the literature to diagonalise the intra-band spin
orbit interaction in semiconductors with diamond lattice can not remove the
inter-band terms. It leads to a bases set for valence band ordered differently
from D_3/2^+ in the O(3) group thus invalidating any correlation of magnetic
quantum number to the z component of angular momentum. Under the double group
consideration, spin-orbit interaction affects all the zone centre states and
offers a mechanism for changing the relative positions of various zone centre
states in the conduction band. In addition to the mixing caused by k
independent spin orbit terms, formation of hybridised orbitals under double
group rules also produce mixing. This can lead to inversion in materials such
as \alpha-tin. The re-arrangement of conduction band zone centre states leads
to a negative \gamma_2 in most materials with respect to the valence band bases
having the same order as D_3/2^+ in the O(3) group. The double group
formulation is also required in the description of Zeeman interaction,
including the S.B term, for the mixed zone centre states. It provides a
correspondence between second order interaction parameters and the Luttinger
invariants. ...

the shell of the SNR, we consider whether the interaction between SNR G35.6-0.4

without producing a GeV counterpart. If so, the pair of SNR/TeV source with no
GeV detection would be reminiscent of other similarly-aged SNRs, such as some
of the TeV hotspots near W28, for which cosmic-ray diffusion may be used to
explain their multi-frequency phenomenology. However, for HESS J1858+020, we
found that although the phase space in principle allows for such GeV--TeV

heralded single photon state engineering, quantum interference, fast state
preparation of two entangled photons and feedback control of quantum
interference. These results point the way to a single platform that will enable
the integration of nonlinear single photon sources and fast reconfigurable
circuits for future photonic quantum information science and technology.

collisions in the granular source model of quark-gluon plasma droplets. The
pion transverse momentum spectra and HBT radii of the granular sources agree
well with the experimental data of the $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV Au-Au and
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb most central collisions. In the granular source
model the larger initial system breakup time may lead to the larger HBT radii
$R_{\rm out}$, $R_{\rm side}$, and $R_{\rm long}$. However, the large droplet
transverse expansion and limited average relative emitting time of particles in
the granular source lead to small ratios of the transverse HBT radii $R_{\rm
out}/R_{\rm side}$.

superimposed axisymmetric RF and solenoid field maps. The algorithm constructs
the transfer matrix directly from one dimensional RF and solenoid field maps
without computing numerical derivatives or eigenfunction expansions of the
field map data. In addition, this method accurately describes the dynamics of
low energy particles starting from a solenoid immersed cathode, allowing the
method to be used to simulate transport through both RF and electrostatic guns.
Comparison of particle tracking with the transfer matrix and direct integration
of the equations of motion through several field set-ups shows excellent
agreement between the two methods.

two-dimensional electron gas with defects. The excitations are expressed in
terms of the wake field of a charged particle moving in plasma. The result
explicitly addresses the efficiency of the photon-to-plasmon conversion and the
type of excitation. While strong absorption of the radiation by the excitations
is reached at larger plasmon wave numbers, intense persistent plasma waves are
created at optimal ones. The latter wave numbers depend on the spectrum of
plasmons and the distance that the waves are required to travel without being
substantially attenuated. Their type, which can be traveling or standing, is
governed by the geometry of the defects and the polarization of the radiation.
We identify such types of traveling plasmons as circular plasmons, excited at
dot defects, and traverse plasmons, excited at straight wire defects and
traveling away from (toward) the wires if their group velocity is positive
(negative). Nonlinear excitations are also accounted for. In particular, we
analyze the zeroth harmonic, linear in the microwave intensity, which has the
character of a frozen charge density wave. The interference of elementary wakes
from defects arranged in truncated periodic sets can produce amplified
plasmons, which are easily portrayed.

in the context of strings compactified on K3 surfaces, we develop techniques to
combine groups of symmetries from different K3 surfaces to larger 'overarching'
symmetry groups.
  We construct a bijection between the full integral homology lattice of K3 and
the Niemeier lattice of type (A_1)^24, which is simultaneously compatible with
the finite symplectic automorphism groups of all Kummer surfaces lying on an
appropriate path in moduli space connecting the square and the tetrahedral
Kummer surfaces. The Niemeier lattice serves to express all these symplectic
automorphisms as elements of the Mathieu group M_24, generating the
'overarching finite symmetry group' (Z_2)^4:A_7 of Kummer surfaces. This group
has order 40320, thus surpassing the size of the largest finite symplectic
automorphism group of a K3 surface by orders of magnitude. For every Kummer
surface this group contains the group of symplectic automorphisms leaving the
Kaehler class invariant which is induced from the underlying torus. Our results
are in line with the existence proofs of Mukai and Kondo, that finite groups of
symplectic automorphisms of K3 are subgroups of one of eleven subgroups of
M_23, and we extend their techniques of lattice embeddings for all Kummer
surfaces with Kaehler class induced from the underlying torus.
