most features of the simulations with quantitative deviations concerning the
shear induced timescales. We attribute these deviations to an underestimation
of the overshoot scenario in the theory.

waveform mode phases evolve together in lock-step through inspiral and merger,
supporting the previous waveform description in terms of an adiabatically rigid

further apply the late-time merger-ringdown model for the rotational frequency

suggests that the major features of these waveforms can be described with
reference only to the intrinsic parameters associated with the state of the
final black hole formed in the merger. We provide an explicit model for the
merger-ringdown radiation, and demonstrate that this model agrees to fitting
factors better than 95% with the original numerical waveforms for system masses

gravitational-wave detection of intermediate-mass black-hole mergers.

of three. The outliers are suggested to be stars where formation of a dust

observations may have been reobserved by Spitzer as a cooler puff at a greater
distance from the RCB. RCBs which experience more frequent optical declines
have, in general, a circumstellar environment containing puffs subtending a
larger solid angle at the star and a quasi-constant infrared flux. Yet, the

Hamiltonian takes into account interaction-driven tunneling processes, which
are shown to play a principal role at high filling factors, when the standard
hopping rate parameter turns out to be negative. By calculating the energy and

replaced by an effective hopping rate parameter containing the additional
contribution an interaction-driven hopping rate. Such a contribution turns out
to be crucial at high filling factors, since it preserves the positivity of the

regimes inertial and kinetic on the efficiency of particle acceleration. We use
2.5D PIC simulations to study how particles are accelerated when DAW, triggered
by a solar flare, propagates in transversely inhomogeneous plasma that mimics

(along the magnetic field), in density gradient regions is ~20% by the time
when DAW develops 3 wavelengths and is increasing to ~30% by the time DAW
develops 13 wavelengths. In all considered cases ions are heated in transverse
to the magnetic field direction and fraction of the heated particles is ~35%.
(ii) The case of R-circular, L- and R- elliptical polarisation DAWs, with the
electric field in the non-ignorable transverse direction exceeding several
times that of in the ignorable direction, produce more pronounced parallel
electron beams and transverse ion beams in the ignorable direction. In the
inertial regime such polarisations yield the fraction of accelerated electrons
~20%. In the kinetic regime this increases to ~35%. (iii) The parallel electric
field that is generated in the density inhomogeneity regions is independent of
m_i/m_e and exceeds the Dreicer value by 8 orders of magnitude. (iv) Electron
beam velocity has the phase velocity of the DAW. Thus electron acceleration is
via Landau damping of DAWs. For the Alfven speeds of 0.3c the considered
mechanism can accelerate electrons to energies circa 20 keV. (v) The increase
of mass ratio from m_i/m_e=16 to 73.44 increases the fraction of accelerated

This spectral feature is attributed to the inter-site excitation from the local

the essential role of exchange splitting of the conducting electrons. Based on

showed that even a tiny amount of isocurvature perturbation, if not accounted

observations such as those provided by the Planck mission, affect Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations interpretation and introduce biases in the recovered dark
energy properties that are larger than forecasted statistical errors from
future surveys. Extending on this work, here we adopt a general fiducial
cosmology which includes a varying dark energy equation of state parameter and
curvature. Beside Baryon Acoustic Oscillations measurements, we include the
information from the shape of the galaxy power spectrum and consider a joint
analysis of a Planck-like Cosmic Microwave Background probe and a future,
space-based, Large Scale Structure probe not too dissimilar from recently
proposed surveys. We find that this allows one to break the degeneracies that
affect the Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
combination. As a result, most of the cosmological parameter systematic biases
arising from an incorrect assumption on the isocurvature fraction parameter
$f_{iso}$, become negligible with respect to the statistical errors. We find
that the Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure combination
gives a statistical error $\sigma(f_{iso}) \sim 0.008$, even when curvature and
a varying dark energy equation of state are included, which is smaller than the
error obtained from Cosmic Microwave Background alone when flatness and
cosmological constant are assumed. These results confirm the synergy and
complementarity between Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure,

analytical model for off-resonant Faraday rotation. The model, applicable to
all hot alkali metal vapours, is seen to predict the rotation observed in
caesium, at temperatures as high as 115 $^{\circ}$C, to within 1% accuracy for
probe light detuned by greater than 2 GHz from the $D_{2}$ lines. We also
demonstrate the existence of a weak probe intensity limit, below which the
effect of hyperfine pumping is negligible. Following the identification of this
regime we validate a more comprehensive model for the absorption and dispersion
in the vicinity of the $D_{2}$ lines, implemented in the form of a computer
code. We demonstrate the ability of this model to predict Doppler-broadened
spectra to within 0.5% rms deviation for temperatures up to 50 $^{\circ}$C.

method (PERM), a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with resampling, to various
problems in polymer physics. PERM produces samples according to any given
prescribed weight distribution, by growing configurations step by step with
controlled bias, and correcting ""bad"" configurations by ""population control"".
The latter is implemented, in contrast to other population based algorithms
like e.g. genetic algorithms, by depth-first recursion which avoids storing all
members of the population at the same time in computer memory. The problems we
discuss all concern single polymers (with one exception), but under various
conditions: Homopolymers in good solvents and at the $\Theta$ point, semi-stiff
polymers, polymers in confining geometries, stretched polymers undergoing a
forced globule-linear transition, star polymers, bottle brushes, lattice
animals as a model for randomly branched polymers, DNA melting, and finally --
as the only system at low temperatures, lattice heteropolymers as simple models
for protein folding. PERM is for some of these problems the method of choice,
but it can also fail. We discuss how to recognize when a result is reliable,
and we discuss also some types of bias that can be crucial in guiding the
growth into the right directions.

18 +- 6 solar masses, and that of core 3 are 15 +- 7 solar masses and 11 +- 3
solar masses. The spectrum of core 3 shows blue-skewed self-absorption, which
suggests gas infall -- a collapsing core. The observed broad linewidths of the
seven gas cores indicate non-thermal motions. These non-thermal motions can be
interactions with nearby outflows or due to the initial turbulence; the former
is observed, while the role of initial turbulence is less certain. Finally, the
virial masses of the gas cores are larger than the LTE masses, which for a
bound core implies a requirement on the external pressure of ~ 10^8 K/cm^3. The

Pd0.75Co0.25 and Pd0.5Co0.5 alloys, as well as of the surface segregated
Pd/Pd0.75Co0.25 alloy. We find the hybridization of dPd and dCo electronic
states to be the main factor controlling the electrocatalytic properties of
Pd/Pd0.75Co0.25. Namely the dPd - dCo hybridization causes low energy shift of
the surface Pd d-band with respect to that for Pd(111). This shift weakens
chemical bonds between the ORR intermediates and the Pd/Pd0.75Co0.25 surface,
which is favorable for the reaction. Non-segregated Pd0.75Co0.25 and Pd0.5Co0.5
surfaces are found to be too reactive for ORR due to bonding of the
intermediates to the surface Co atoms. Analysis of the ORR free energy
diagrams, built for the Pd and Pd/Pd0.75Co0.25, shows that the co-adsorption of
the ORR intermediates and water changes the ORR energetics significantly and
makes ORR more favorable. We find the onset ORR potential estimated for the

agreement with experiment. The relevance of this finding to the real reaction

phases but require no CP violation. So far a single true TP asymmetry has been
measured in $K_L\to \pi^+\pi^- e^+e^-$. A general discussion is presented for
T-odd TP asymmetries in four-body decays. It is shown that TP asymmetries
vanish for two identical and kinematically indistinguishable particles in the
final state. Two examples are $D^0\to K^-\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+$ and $D^+\to
K^-\pi^+\pi^+\pi^0$. A non-zero TP asymmetry can be expected when non-trivial
kinematic correlations exist, as in the decay $K_L \to e^+ e^- e^+ e^-$. Triple
product asymmetries measured in charmed particle decays indicate an interesting
pattern of final-state interactions. We reiterate a discussion of TP
asymmetries in $B$ meson decays to two vector mesons each decaying to a
pseudoscalar pair, extending results to decays where one vector meson decays
into a lepton pair. We derive expressions for time-dependent TP asymmetries for
neutral B decays to flavorless states in terms of the neutral $B$ mass
difference $\Delta m$ and the width-difference $\Delta\Gamma$. Time-integrated
true CP violating asymmetries, measurable for untagged $B_s$ decays, are shown
to be suppressed by neither $\Gamma_s/\Delta m_s$ nor $\Delta\Gamma_s/\Gamma_s$
if transversity amplitudes for CP-even and CP-odd states involve different weak
phases. In contrast, fake asymmetries require flavor tagging and are suppressed
by the former ratio when time-integrated. We apply our results to $B\to
K^*\phi$ and $B_s\to\phi\phi$ data and suggest an application for $B_s\to

due to the combined power of having many stars with essentially the same
distance, age, and initial composition. This makes clusters excellent test
benches for verification of stellar evolution theory. To fully exploit this
potential, it is vital that the star sample is uncontaminated by stars that are
not members of the cluster. Techniques for determining cluster membership
therefore play a key role in the investigation of clusters. We present results
on three clusters in the Kepler field of view based on a newly established
technique that uses asteroseismology to identify fore- or background stars in
the field, which demonstrates advantages over classical methods such as
kinematic and photometry measurements. Four previously identified seismic
non-members in NGC6819 are confirmed in this study, and three additional
non-members are found -- two in NGC6819 and one in NGC6791. We further
highlight which stars are, or might be, affected by blending, which needs to be
taken into account when analysing these Kepler data.

contaminating light, eccentricity, correlated noise, and numerical integration
over long exposure times. The physical properties are derived using constraints
from five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. An alternative
approach using a calibration from eclipsing binary star systems is explored and
found to give comparable numbers. My results are in good agreement with
published properties for most of the transiting systems, but discrepancies are
identified for CoRoT-5, CoRoT-8, CoRoT-13, Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. Many of the
errorbars quoted in the literature are underestimated. Refined orbital
ephemerides are given for CoRoT-8 and for the Kepler planets. Asteroseismic
constraints on the density of the host stars are in good agreement with the
photometric equivalents for HD 17156 and TrES-2, but not for HAT-P-7 and

Whilst most would benefit from further photometry and spectroscopy, HD 17156,
HD 80606, HAT-P-7 and TrES-2 are now extremely well characterised. HAT-P-11 is
an exceptional candidate for studying starspots. The orbital ephemerides of

X-ray, optical and radio wavelengths from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), called the
afterglow, is likely produced by the external forward shock model. In this
model, the GRB jet interacts with the circum-stellar medium and drives a shock
that heats the medium, which radiates via synchrotron emission. In this work,
we carried out a detailed analysis of the late time afterglow data of GRB
090902B using a very careful accounting of the Inverse Compton losses. We find
that in the context of the external forward shock model, the only viable option
to explain the X-ray and optical data of GRB 090920B is to have the electron
energy distribution deviate from a power-law shape and exhibit some slight
curvature immediately downstream of the shock front (we explored other models
that rely on a single power-law assumption, but they all fail to explain the
observations). We find the fraction of the energy of shocked plasma in magnetic
field to be ~10^{-6} using late time afterglow data, which is consistent with
the value obtained using early gamma-ray data. Studies like the present one
might be able to provide a link between GRB afterglow modeling and numerical
simulations of particle acceleration in collisionless shocks. We also provide
detailed calculations for the early (< 10^3 s) high energy (> 100 MeV) emission

investigated the possibility that the ~10 keV excess observed in the spectrum

morphological classifications from the RC3 and the Galaxy Zoo, the bluer colors
of BAT AGN are mainly due to a higher fraction of mergers and massive spirals
than in the comparison samples. BAT AGN in massive galaxies (log M_*>10.5) have
a 5 to 10 times higher rate of spiral morphologies than in SDSS AGN or inactive
galaxies. We also see enhanced far-IR emission in BAT AGN suggestive of higher
levels of star formation compared to the comparison samples. BAT AGN are
preferentially found in the most massive host galaxies with high concentration
indexes indicative of large bulge-to-disk ratios and large supermassive black
holes. The narrow-line BAT AGN have similar intrinsic luminosities as the SDSS
NL Seyferts based on measurements of [O III]. There is also a correlation
between the stellar mass and X-ray emission. The BAT AGN in mergers have bluer
colors and greater ultra hard X-ray emission compared to the BAT sample as
whole. In agreement with the Unified Model of AGN, and the relatively unbiased
nature of the BAT sources, the host galaxy colors and morphologies are
independent of measures of obscuration such as X-ray column density or Seyfert
type. The high fraction of massive spiral galaxies and galaxy mergers in BAT
AGN suggest that host galaxy morphology is related to the activation and
fueling of local AGN.

exert no forces inside of cool clouds), that the cosmic-ray density does not
increase within clouds (it may slightly decrease in general, and decrease by an
order of magnitude in some cases), and that cosmic-ray heating (via Alfven-wave

approach, in opposition to the more classical 'mechanical' approach to fluid
flows. In this heuristic review, we describe why the apparent dichotomy between
those approaches has slowly faded away over the years. To support our
discussion, we give an overview of different interpretations of a single
equation, the diffusive Johnson-Segalman (dJS) equation, in the context of
shear-banding. We restrict ourselves to dJS, but we show that the equation can
be written in various equivalent forms usually associated with opposite
approaches. We first review briefly the origin of the dJS model and its initial
rheological interpretation in the context of shear-banding. Then we describe
the analogy between dJS and reaction-diffusion equations. In the case of
anisotropic diffusion, we show how the dJS governing equations for steady shear
flow are analogous to the equations of the dynamics of a particle in a quartic
potential. Going beyond the existing literature, we then draw on the Lagrangian
formalism to describe how the boundary conditions can have a key impact on the
banding state. Finally, we reinterpret the dJS equation again and we show that
a rigorous effective free energy can be constructed, in the spirit of early
thermodynamic interpretations or in terms of more recent approaches exploiting

order corrections is therefore needed for the nonlinear evolution. The
renormalization group improved resummed equation in the presence of the
saturation boundary is investigated, and the corresponding saturation scale is
extracted. A significant reduction of the saturation scale is found, and we
observe that the onset of the saturation corrections is delayed to higher
rapidities. This seems to be related to the characteristic feature of the
resummed splitting function which at moderately small values of x possesses a
minimum.

supermassive black holes (SMBH) have to be assembled within the first eight
hundred million years. Under our standard galaxy formation scenario such fast
growth implies large gas densities providing sustained accretion at critical or
supercritical rates onto an initial black hole seed. It has been a long
standing question whether and how such high black hole accretion rates can be
achieved and sustained at the centers of early galaxies. Here we use our new
cosmological hydrodynamic simulation (MassiveBlack) covering a volume (0.75
\Gpc)^3 appropriate for studying the rare first quasars to show that steady
high density cold gas flows responsible for assembling the first galaxies
produce the high gas densities that lead to sustained critical accretion rates
and hence rapid growth commensurate with the existence of ~10^9 solar mass
black holes as early as z~7. We find that under these conditions quasar
feedback is not effective at stopping the cold gas from penetrating the central
regions and hence cannot quench the accretion until the host galaxy reaches
M_halo > 10^{12} solar masses. This cold-flow driven scenario for the formation
of quasars implies that they should be ubiquitous in galaxies in the early
universe and that major (proto)galaxy mergers are not a requirement for
efficient fuel supply and growth, particularly for the earliest SMBHs.

BHs in high-mass halos tend to be unusually bright due to extended periods of
Eddington growth caused by high density cold flows into the halo center. We
further use these luminosity functions to make predictions for the number
density of quasars in upcoming surveys, predicting there should be ~119+-28

fully consistent with current constraints for Sloan quasars (r_0~17 h^{-1} Mpc
at z=4 for quasars above m_i = 20.2), and grows slowly with redshift up to z=6

depends weakly on luminosity for low L_BH, but gets stronger at higher L_BH as
the BHs are found in higher mass halos.

  Responses","8 Pages, 3 figures, 7 equations",,,,"physics.comp-ph cs.CV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Template-based signal detection most often relies on computing a correlation,
or a dot product, between an incoming data stream and a signal template. Such a
correlation results in an ongoing estimate of the magnitude of the signal in
the data stream. However, it does not directly indicate the presence or absence
of the signal. The problem is really one of model-testing, and the relevant
quantity is the Bayesian evidence (marginal likelihood) of the signal model.
Given a signal template and an ongoing data stream, we have developed an
evidence-based filter that computes the Bayesian evidence that a signal is
present in the data. We demonstrate this algorithm by applying it to
brain-machine interface (BMI) data obtained by recording human brain electrical
activity, or electroencephalography (EEG). A very popular and effective
paradigm in EEG-based BMI is based on the detection of the P300 evoked brain
response which is generated in response to particular sensory stimuli. The goal
is to detect the presence of a P300 signal in ongoing EEG activity as
accurately and as fast as possible. Our algorithm uses a subject-specific P300
template to compute the Bayesian evidence that a applying window of EEG data
contains the signal. The efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated by
comparing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the evidence-based
filter to the usual correlation method. Our results show a significant
improvement in single-trial P300 detection. The evidence-based filter promises
to improve the accuracy and speed of the detection of evoked brain responses in
BMI applications as well the detection of template signals in more general
signal processing applications

new evidence for a reversal in the redshift-dependent fraction of star forming
galaxies with detectable Lyman alpha emission in the redshift range 6.3 < z <
8.8. Our earlier surveys with the DEIMOS spectrograph demonstrated a
significant increase with redshift in the fraction of line emitting galaxies
over the interval 4 < z < 6, particularly for intrinsically faint systems which
dominate the luminosity density. Using the longer wavelength sensitivities of
LRIS and NIRSPEC, we have targeted 19 Lyman break galaxies selected using
recent WFC3/IR data whose photometric redshifts are in the range 6.3 < z < 8.8
and which span a wide range of intrinsic luminosities. Our spectroscopic
exposures typically reach a 5-sigma sensitivity of < 50 A for the rest-frame
equivalent width (EW) of Lyman alpha emission. Despite the high fraction of
emitters seen only a few hundred million years later, we find only 2 convincing
and 1 possible line emitter in our more distant sample. Combining with
published data on a further 7 sources obtained using FORS2 on the ESO VLT, and
assuming continuity in the trends found at lower redshift, we discuss the
significance of this apparent reversal in the redshift-dependent Lyman alpha
fraction in the context of our range in continuum luminosity. Assuming all the
targeted sources are at their photometric redshift and our assumptions about
the Lyman alpha EW distribution are correct, we would expect to find so few
emitters in less than 1% of the realizations drawn from our lower redshift
samples. Our new results provide further support for the suggestion that, at
the redshifts now being probed spectroscopically, we are entering the era where
the intergalactic medium is partially neutral.

also the full multipole expansion of the Coulomb potential. The dynamics of
proton nuclear and Coulomb breakup is compared to that of an equiva- lent
neutron of larger binding energy in order to elucidate the differences with the
well understood neutron breakup mechanism. A number of experimentally
measurable observables such as parallel momentum distributions, proton angular
distributions and total breakup cross sections are calculated. With respect to
nuclear breakup it is found that a proton behaves exactly as a neutron of
larger binding energy. The extra 'effective energy' is due to the combined
core-target Coulomb barrier. In Coulomb breakup we distinguish the effect of
the core-target Coulomb potential (called recoil effect), with respect to which
the proton behaves again as a more bound neutron, from the direct proton-target
Coulomb potential. The latter gives cross sections about an order of magnitude
larger than the recoil term. The two effects give rise to complicated
interferences in the parallel momentum distributions. They are instead easily
separable in the proton angular distributions which are therefore suggested as
a very useful observable for future experimental studies.

family is ""effectual"" for the detection of a significant fraction of generic
spinning binaries in the comparable-mass regime (m_2/m_1 <~ 10), providing an
attractive and feasible way of searching for gravitational waves (GWs) from

properties of the disk of the Milky Way, such as the stellar number density
distribution, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and the
metallicity gradient as a function of radial position and time. We vary some of
these properties, creating four models to test the sensitivity of our

rates, planet formation, and the time required for complex life to evolve. Our
study improves on other literature on the GHZ by populating stars on an
individual basis and by modelling SNII and SNIa sterilizations by selecting
their progenitors from within this preexisting stellar population. Furthermore,
we consider habitability on tidally locked and non-tidally locked planets
separately, and study habitability as a function of height above and below the
Galactic midplane. In the model that most accurately reproduces the properties
of the Galaxy, the results indicate that an individual SNIa is ~5.6 \times more
lethal than an individual SNII on average. In addition, we predict that ~1.2%
of all stars host a planet that may have been capable of supporting complex
life at some point in the history of the Galaxy. Of those stars with a
habitable planet, ~75% of planets are predicted to be in a tidally locked
configuration with their host star. The majority of these planets that may
support complex life are found towards the inner Galaxy, distributed within,

$O(\poly(h)n^{5/4 + \epsilon})$ time for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. We also
present the first $O(\poly(h)n)$ time algorithm to find a separator of size
$O(n^c)$ for a constant $c < 1$. As corollaries of our results, we get improved

$\ell$ and $h$, we give an $O(m + n^{2 + \epsilon}/\ell)$ time algorithm that
either produces a $K_h$-minor of depth $O(\ell\log n)$ or a separator of size
at most $O(n/\ell + \ell h^2\log n)$. This improves the shallow minor algorithm
of Plotkin, Rao, and Smith when $m = \Omega(n^{1 + \epsilon})$. We get a
similar running time improvement for an approximation algorithm for the problem
of finding a largest $K_h$-minor in a given graph.

Higgs-Z boson production, at O(alpha^3_{ew}) from e+e- collisions. These
channels furnish cross-sections in the range of 10-100 fb for Ecm=0.5 TeV and
exhibit potentially large radiative corrections (of order 50%), whose origin
can be traced back to the genuine enhancement capabilities of the triple Higgs
boson self-interactions. Next we consider the loop-induced production of a
single Higgs boson from direct gamma-gamma scattering. We single out sizable
departures from the corresponding rates in the Standard Model, which are again
correlated to trademark dynamical features of the 2HDM -- namely the balance of
the non-standard Higgs/gauge, Higgs/fermion and Higgs self-interactions leading
to sizable (destructive) interference effects. This pattern of quantum effects
is unmatched in the MSSM, and could hence provide distinctive footprints of
non-supersymmetric Higgs boson physics. Both calculations are revisited within
a common, brought-to-date framework and include, in particular, the most
stringent bounds from unitarity and flavor physics.

notice that the critical end point (CEP) which is located near the temperature

second order transition in the chiral limit of massless quarks, the crossover

broken chiral symmetry, has been identified as quite a soft and smooth

temperature is similar to that of a dilute Bose gas but with renormalized mass
m^* and scattering length a^*. m^* is the mass of the elementary excitations at
the quantum critical point governing the transition from the superfluid phase
to the Mott insulating phase, while a^* is related to their effective
interaction at low energy. We use a nonperturbative renormalization-group
approach to compute these parameters as a function of the ratio t/U between
hopping amplitude and on-site repulsion.

High-resolution optical spectra are analyzed using a family of model
atmospheres with different He/H ratios. Atmospheric parameters are estimated
from the ionization equilibrium set by neutral and singly ionized species of Fe
and Mg, the excitation of Fe I and Fe II lines and the wings of the Paschen
lines. On the assumption that the He I lines are of photospheric and not
chromospheric in origin, a He/H ratio of approximately unity is found by
imposing the condition that the adopted He/H ratio of the model atmosphere must
equal the ratio derived from the observed He I triplet lines at 5876, 4471 and
4713 Angstrom, and singlet lines at 4922 and 5015 Angstrom. Using the model
with the best-fitting atmospheric parameters for this He/H ratio, SAO 40039 is
confirmed to exhibit mild dust-gas depletion, i.e., the star has an atmosphere
deficient in elements of high condensation temperature. The star appears to be
moderately metal-deficient with [Fe/H]=-0.4 dex. But the star's intrinsic
metallicty as estimated from Na, S and Zn, elements of a low condensation
temperature, is [Fe/H]_o {[Fe/H]_o refers to the star's intrinsic metallicity}
~ -0.2. The star is enriched in N and perhaps O too, changes reflecting the

show that it is possible to detect repeating features in the lightcurve of

We investigate the lightcurve features of such Rapidly Rotating Lens (RRL)

lens orbital period and possibly measurements of all orbital elements including
the inclination and eccentricity. Measurement of the period from the lightcurve

(LMC). Its proximity and rapid evolution makes it a unique case study of the
early phases in the development of a supernova remnant. One particular aspect
of interest is the possible formation of dust in SN1987A, as SNe could
contribute significantly to the dust seen at high redshifts. Aims: We explore
the properties of SN1987A and its circumburst medium as seen at mm and sub-mm
wavelengths, bridging the gap between extant radio and infrared (IR)
observations of respectively the synchrotron and dust emission. Methods:
SN1987A was observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 3.2
mm in July 2005, and with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) at 0.87 mm
in May 2007. We present the images and brightness measurements of SN1987A at
these wavelengths for the first time. Results: SN1987A is detected as an
unresolved point source of 11.2 +/- 2.0 mJy at 3.2 mm (5"" beam) and 21 +/- 4
mJy at 0.87 mm (18"" beam). These flux densities are in perfect agreement with
extrapolations of the powerlaw radio spectrum and modified-blackbody dust
emission, respectively. This places limits on the presence of free-free
emission, which is similar to the expected free-free emission from the ionized
ejecta from SN1987A. Adjacent, fainter emission is observed at 0.87 mm
extending ~0.5' towards the south-west. This could be the impact of the
supernova progenitor's wind when it was still a red supergiant upon a dense
medium. Conclusions: We have established a continuous spectral energy
distribution for the emission from SN1987A and its immediate surroundings,
linking the IR and radio data. This places limits on the contribution from
ionized plasma. Our sub-mm image reveals complexity in the distribution of cold
dust surrounding SN1987A, but leaves room for freshly synthesized dust in the
SN ejecta.

systems involving junctions that appear in a range of physical situations, for
example, in the context of F- and D-type strings in string theory. We apply
this formalism to a particular field theory, Carter's pentavac model, where the
strength of the symmetry breaking is governed by the parameter $|\epsilon|< 1$.
We find that for low values of the symmetry breaking parameter X-type junctions
will be stable, whereas for higher values an X-type junction will separate into
two Y-type junctions. The critical angle separating the two regimes is given by
\alpha_c = 293^{\circ}\sqrt{|\epsilon|}$ and this is confirmed using simple
numerical experiments. We go on to simulate the pentavac model from random
initial conditions and we find that the dominant junction is of \ytype for
$|\epsilon| \geq 0.02$ and is of \xtype for $|\epsilon| \leq 0.02$. We also
find that for small $\epsilon$ the evolution of the number of domain walls
$\qsubrm{N}{dw}$ in Minkowski space does not follow the standard $\propto

pronounced as $\epsilon$ is decreased. The presence of dissipation appears to

compact objects. They transport large amounts of energy to large distances from
the source, and their interaction with the ambient medium has a crucial effect
on the evolution of the system. The propagation of the jet is characterized by
the formation of a shocked ""head"" at the front of the jet which dissipates the
jet's energy and a cocoon that surrounds the jet and potentially collimates it.
We present here a self consistent, analytic model that follows the evolution of
the jet and its cocoon, and describes their interaction. We show that the
critical parameter that determines the properties of the jet-cocoon system is
the dimensionless ratio between the jet's energy density and the rest-mass
energy density of the ambient medium. This parameter, together with the jet's
injection angle, also determines whether the jet is collimated by the cocoon or
not. The model is applicable to relativistic, unmagnetized, jets on all scales
and may be used to determine the conditions in AGNs jets as well as in GRBs or
microquasars. It shows that AGN and microquasar jets are hydrodynamically
collimated due to the interaction with the ambient medium, while GRB jets can
be collimated only inside a star and become uncollimated once they breakout.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communication",,"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110439",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of estimating sparse communication channels in the
MIMO context. In small to medium bandwidth communications, as in the current
standards for OFDM and CDMA communication systems (with bandwidth up to 20
MHz), such channels are individually sparse and at the same time share a common
support set. Since the underlying physical channels are inherently
continuous-time, we propose a parametric sparse estimation technique based on
finite rate of innovation (FRI) principles. Parametric estimation is especially
relevant to MIMO communications as it allows for a robust estimation and
concise description of the channels. The core of the algorithm is a
generalization of conventional spectral estimation methods to multiple input
signals with common support. We show the application of our technique for
channel estimation in OFDM (uniformly/contiguous DFT pilots) and CDMA downlink
(Walsh-Hadamard coded schemes). In the presence of additive white Gaussian
noise, theoretical lower bounds on the estimation of SCS channel parameters in
Rayleigh fading conditions are derived. Finally, an analytical spatial channel
model is derived, and simulations on this model in the OFDM setting show the
symbol error rate (SER) is reduced by a factor 2 (0 dB of SNR) to 5 (high SNR)
compared to standard non-parametric methods - e.g. lowpass interpolation.

ll-GRBs differ from typical long GRBs (LGRBs) in many aspects, they also share
some common features. Therefore, the question whether the gamma-ray emission of
ll-GRBs and LGRBs has a common origin is of great interest. Here we address
this question by testing whether ll-GRBs, like LGRBs according to the Collapsar
model, can be generated by relativistic jets that punch holes in the envelopes
of their progenitor stars. The collapsar model predicts that the durations of
most observed bursts will be comparable to, or longer than, the time it takes
the jets to breakout of the star. We calculate the jet breakout times of
ll-GRBs and compare them to the observed durations. We find that there is a
significant access of ll-GRBs with durations that are much shorter than the jet
breakout time and that these are inconsistent with the Collapsar model. We
conclude that the processes that dominate the gamma-ray emission of ll-GRBs and
of LGRBs are most likely fundamentally different.

receiver before communication begins dramatically simplifies the theory of

study other scenarios for entanglement-assisted classical communication. In
this vein, the present paper makes several contributions to the theory of
entanglement-assisted classical communication. First, we rephrase the
Giovannetti-Lloyd-Maccone sequential decoding argument as a more general
""packing lemma"" and show that it gives an alternate way of achieving the
entanglement-assisted classical capacity. Next, we show that a similar
sequential decoder can achieve the Hsieh-Devetak-Winter region for
entanglement-assisted classical communication over a multiple access channel.
Third, we prove the existence of a quantum simultaneous decoder for
entanglement-assisted classical communication over a multiple access channel
with two senders. This result implies a solution of the quantum simultaneous
decoding conjecture for unassisted classical communication over quantum
multiple access channels with two senders, but the three-sender case still
remains open (Sen recently and independently solved this unassisted two-sender
case with a different technique). We then leverage this result to recover the
known regions for unassisted and assisted quantum communication over a quantum
multiple access channel, though our proof exploits a coherent quantum
simultaneous decoder. Finally, we determine an achievable rate region for
communication over an entanglement-assisted bosonic multiple access channel and
compare it with the Yen-Shapiro outer bound for unassisted communication over
the same channel.

unsupervised counterpart of Support Vector Machines. Given a set of n points in
Rd, the objective is to produce the hyperplane (passing through the origin)
which maximizes the separation margin, that is, the minimal distance between
the hyperplane and any input point. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first paper achieving provable results regarding FHP. We provide both lower and
upper bounds to this NP-hard problem. First, we give a simple randomized
algorithm whose running time is n^O(1/{\theta}^2) where {\theta} is the optimal
separation margin. We show that its exponential dependency on 1/{\theta}^2 is
tight, up to sub-polynomial factors, assuming SAT cannot be solved in
sub-exponential time. Next, we give an efficient approxima- tion algorithm. For
any {\alpha} \in [0, 1], the algorithm produces a hyperplane whose distance
from at least 1 - 5{\alpha} fraction of the points is at least {\alpha} times
the optimal separation margin. Finally, we show that FHP does not admit a PTAS

oldest one is the Einstein-Jordan conundrum which led Jordan in 1925 to the
discovery of quantum field theory. This comparison of fluctuations in
subsystems of heat bath systems (Einstein) with those resulting from the
restriction of the QFT vacuum state to an open subvolume (Jordan) leads to a
perfect analogy; the globally pure vacuum state becomes upon local restriction
a strongly impure KMS state. This phenomenon of localization-caused thermal
behavior as well as the vacuum-polarization clouds at the causal boundary of
the localization region places localization in QFT into a sharp contrast with
quantum mechanics and justifies the attribute ""holstic"". In fact it positions
the E-J Gedankenexperiment into the same conceptual category as the
cosmological constant problem and the Unruh Gedankenexperiment. The holistic
structure of QFT resulting from ""modular localization"" also leads to a revision
of the conceptual origin of the crucial crossing property which entered
particle theory at the time of the bootstrap S-matrix approach but suffered
from incorrect use in the S-matrix settings of the dual model and string
theory. The new holistic point of view, which strengthens the autonomous aspect
of QFT, also comes with new messages for gauge theory by exposing the clash
between Hilbert space structure and localization and presenting alternative
solutions based on the use of stringlocal fields in Hilbert space. Among other
things this leads to a radical reformulation of the Englert-Higgs symmetry
breaking mechanism.

selected from our VLT/Hawk-I imaging survey over three independent fields. In
particular we report on two newly discovered galaxies at redshift ~6.7 in the
NTT deep field: both galaxies show a Ly-alpha emission line with rest-frame EWs
of the order 15-20 A and luminosities of 2-4 X 10^{42} erg/s. We also present
the results of ultra-deep observations of a sample of i-dropout galaxies, from
which we set a solid upper limit on the fraction of interlopers. Out of the 20
z-dropouts observed we confirm 5 galaxies at 6.7 < z < 7.1. This is
systematically below the expectations drawn on the basis of lower redshift
observations: in particular there is a significant lack of objects with
intermediate Ly-alpha EWs (between 20 and 55 A). We conclude that the trend for
the fraction of Ly-alpha emission in LBGs that is constantly increasing from
z~3 to z~6 is most probably reversed from z~6 to z~7.
  Explaining the observed rapid change in the LAE fraction among the drop-out
population with reionization requires a fast evolution of the neutral fraction
of hydrogen in the Universe. Assuming that the Universe is completely ionized
at z=6 and adopting the semi-analytical models of Dijkstra et al. (2011), we
find that our data require a change of the neutral hydrogen fraction of the
order Delta chi_{HI} ~ 0.6 in a time Delta z ~ 1, provided that the escape
fraction does not increase dramatically over the same redshift interval.

members to eliminate idiosyncratic mortality risk, that is there are too few
members to effectively pool mortality risk. This means that when there are few
members in the scheme, there is an increased risk of the liability value
deviating significantly from the expected liability value, as compared to a
large scheme.
  We quantify this risk through examining the coefficient of variation of a
scheme's liability value relative to its expected value. We examine how the
coefficient of variation varies with the number of members and find that, even
with a few hundred members in the scheme, idiosyncratic mortality risk may
still be significant. Using a stochastic mortality model reduces the
idiosyncratic mortality risk but at the cost of increasing the overall
mortality risk in the scheme.
  Next we quantify the amount of the mortality risk concentrated in the
executive section of the scheme, where the executives receive a benefit that is
higher than the non-executive benefit. We use the Euler capital allocation
principle to allocate the total standard deviation of the liability value
between the executive and non-executive sections. We find that the proportion
of the standard deviation allocated to the executive section is higher than is
suggested by an allocation based on the members' benefit amounts. While the
results are sensitive to the choice of mortality model, they do suggest that
the mortality risk of the scheme should be monitored and managed within the
sections of a scheme, and not only on a scheme-wide basis.

dealing with code containing loops. The problem is that even a single loop can
generate a huge number of different symbolic execution paths, corresponding to
different number of loop iterations and taking various paths through the loop.
  We introduce a technique which, given a start location above some loops and a
target location anywhere below these loops, returns a feasible path between
these two locations, if such a path exists. The technique infers a collection
of constraint systems from the program and uses them to steer the symbolic
execution towards the target. On reaching a loop it iteratively solves the
appropriate constraint system to find out which path through this loop to take,
or, alternatively, whether to continue below the loop. To construct the
constraint systems we express the values of variables modified in a loop as
functions of the number of times a given path through the loop was executed.
  We have built a prototype implementation of our technique and compared it to
state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools on simple programs with loops. The
results show significant improvements in the running time. We found instances
where our algorithm finished in seconds, whereas the other tools did not finish
within an hour. Our approach also shows very good results in the case when the
target location is not reachable by any feasible path.

be inappropriate to use these observables to extract the value of the QCD

hand, allows us to find out the surface tension coefficient of quark gluon bags
and, under a plausible assumption, to determine the endpoint temperature of the
QCD phase diagram, on the other hand. The present model considers the confining
color tube as the cylindrical quark gluon bag with non-zero surface tension. A
close inspection of the free energies of elongated cylindrical bag and the
confining color tube that connects the static quark-antiquark pair allows us to
find out the string tension in terms of the surface tension, thermal pressure
and the bag radius. Using the derived relation it is possible to estimate the
bag surface tension at zero temperature directly from the lattice QCD data and
to estimate the (tri)critical endpoint temperature. In the present analysis the
topological free energy of the cylindrical bag is accounted for the first time.
The requirement of positive entropy density of such bags leads to negative
values of the surface tension coefficient of quark gluon bags at the cross-over
region, i.e. at the continuous transition to deconfined quarks and gluons. We
argue that the cross-over existence at supercritical temperatures in ordinary
liquids is also provided by the negative surface tension coefficient values. It
is shown that the confining tube model naturally accounts for an existence of a
very pronounced surprising maximum of the tube entropy observed in the lattice
QCD simulations, which, as we argue, signals about the fractional surface
formation of the confining tube. In addition, using the developed formalism we
suggest the gas of free tubes model and demonstrate that it contains two
phases.

needed to flesh out the formation pathways for extrasolar planets and brown
dwarfs. Aperture masking is a new technique that is able to address an
important part of this discovery space. We observed the two debris disk systems
HD 92945 and HD 141569 with sparse aperture masking (SAM), a new mode offered
on the NaCo instrument at the VLT. A search for faint companions was performed
using a detection strategy based on the analysis of closure phases recovered
from interferograms recorded on the Conica camera. Our results demonstrate that
SAM is a very competitive mode in the field of companion detection. We obtained
5 sigma high-contrast detection limits at lambda/D of 2.5x10^{-3} (\Delta L' =
6.5) for HD 92945 and 4.6x10^{-3} (\Delta L' = 5.8) for HD 141569. According to
brown dwarf evolutionary models, our data impose an upper mass boundary for any
companion for the two stars to, respectively, 18 and 22 Jupiter masses at
minimum separations of 1.5 and 7 AU. The detection limits is mostly independent
of angular separation, until reaching the diffraction limit of the telescope.
We have placed upper limits on the existence of companions to our target
systems that fall close to the planetary mass regime. This demonstrates the
potential for SAM mode to contribute to studies of faint companions. We
furthermore show that the final dynamic range obtained is directly proportional
to the error on the closure phase measurement. At the present performance
levels of 0.28 degree closure phase error, SAM is among the most competitive
techniques for recovering companions at scales of one to several times the
diffraction limit of the telescope. Further improvements to the detection
threshold can be expected with more accurate phase calibration.

is shown to be weak HKT (hyper-K\""ahler with torsion), with the strong HKT and
HK ones as particular cases. The background gauge fields obey the self-duality
condition. Our formulation suggests that the weak HKT geometry is fully
specified by the two primary potentials: an unconstrained scalar potential
{\cal L}(q^+, q^-, u)|_{\theta = 0} which is the \theta = 0 projection of the
superfield sigma-model Lagrangian, and a charge 3 harmonic analytic potential
{\cal L}^{+ 3a}(q^+, u)|_{\theta = 0} coming from the harmonic constraint on
q^{+ a}. The reductions to the strong HKT and HK geometries amount to simple
restrictions on the underlying potentials. We also show, using the N=2
superfield approach, that the most general bosonic target geometry of the N=4,
d=1 sigma models, of which the weak HKT geometry is a particular case,
naturally comes out after adding the mirror (4, 4, 0) multiplets with different
transformation laws under N=4 supersymmetry and SO(4) R symmetry. Thus the
minimal dimension of the target spaces exhibiting such a ""weakest"" geometry is
8, which corresponds to a pair of the mutually mirror (4, 4, 0) multiplets.

long-wavelength expansion with parameter \epsilon, the coupled Einstein-Maxwell
equations are solved up to O(\epsilon^2). The incompressible Navier-Stokes
equation with external force density is obtained as the constraint equation at
the cutoff surface. For non-extremal black brane, the viscosity of the dual

whose ratio to entropy density \eta/s is independent of both the cutoff r_c and
the black brane charge. Then, we extend our discussion to the

Tracking systems for prostate biopsies make it possible to generate biopsy

They can also guide the clinician toward non-ultrasound targets. In this paper,
a volume-swept 3D US based tracking system for fast and accurate estimation of

patient motion problem with an a priori model of rectal probe kinematics.
Prostate deformations are estimated with elastic registration to maximize
accuracy. The system is robust with only 17 registration failures out of 786
