in the calcined catalysts CuO-ZnO are theoretically investigated using the high
order perturbation formulas of these parameters for a $3d^{9}$ ion in
tetragonally elongated octahedra. In the above formulas, the tetragonal field
parameters $Ds$ and $Dt$ are determined from the superposition model, by
considering the relative axial elongation of the oxygen octahedron around the
Cu$^{2+}$ due to the Jahn-Teller effect. Based on the calculations, the
relative elongation ratios of about 5% and 3% are obtained for the tetragonal
Cu$^{2+}$ centers $A1$ and $A2$, respectively. The theoretical spin Hamiltonian
parameters are in good agreement with the observed values for both systems. The
larger axial elongation in center $A1$ is ascribed to the more significant low
symmetrical (tetragonal) distortion of the Jahn-Teller effect. The local
structures characterized by the above axial elongations are discussed.

a low X-ray to mid-IR luminosity ratio is often claimed to be a reliable

this diagnostic by examining the 12mu IRAS AGN sample for which high
signal-to-noise XMM observations have been recently become available. We find
that the vast majority (10/11) of the AGN that have been classified as CT on
the basis the X-ray spectroscopy by Brightman & Nandra present a low Lx/L6
luminosity ratio, i.e. lower than a few percent of the average AGN ratio which
is typical of reflection-dominated CT sources. At low Lx/L6 ratios we also find
a comparable number of AGN, most of which are heavily absorbed but not CT. This
implies that although most Compton-thick AGN present low Lx/L6 ratios, at least
in the local, Universe, the opposite is not necessarily true. Next, we extend
our analysis to higher redshifts. We perform the same analysis in the CDFS
where excellent quality chandra (4 Ms) and xmm (3 Ms) X-ray spectra are
available. We derive accurate X-ray luminosities for chandra sources using
X-ray spectral fits, as well as 6mu luminosities from SED fits. We find 8 AGN
with low Lx/L6 ratios in total, after excluding one source where the 6mu
emission primarily comes from star-formation. One of these sources has been
already demonstrated to host a CT nucleus, while for another one at a redshift
of z=1.22 we argue it is most likely CT on the basis of its combined chandra
and xmm spectrum. We find a large number of non CT contaminant with low Lx/L6
ratios. The above suggest that a low Lx/L6 ratio alone cannot ascertain the
presence of a CT AGN, albeit the majority of low Lx/L6 AGN are heavily
obscured. The two most reliable CT AGN in the high redshift Universe have high
Lx/L6 ratios, showing that this method cannot provide complete CT AGN samples.

Using laboratory data, we show that this heating process is consistent with a
concentration of a few percent of dangling bonds in HAC and may be initiated by
the recombination of trapped H atoms. We suggest that the release of chemical
energy from dust represents an additional source of excitation for the UIR
bands relaxing the previous requirement that only stochastically heated
molecules having fewer than ~ 50 atoms can produce emission at 3.3 {\mu}m.

points to scattering on aligned elongated dust grains as the major source of
intrinsic polarization, and matches the known orientation of the magnetic

  We argue that many popular ""quantum paradoxes"" stem from a confusion between
mathematical formalism and physics; We demonstrate this by explaining how the
paradoxes go away once a different formalism, usually inconvenient to perform
calculations, is used. we argue that some modern developments, well-studied in
the research literature but generally overlooked by both popular science and
teaching-level literature, make quantum mechanics (that is, ""canonical"" QM, not
extensions of it) less conceptually problematic than it looks at first sight.
  When all this is looked at together, most ""conceptual puzzles"" of QM are not
much different from the well-known paradoxes from probability theory.

evolution and the processes which trigger and fuel AGN activity. Here we
calculate model spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that include emission from
the AGN, the host galaxy stellar population, and dust enshrouded star
formation. Using the framework of cosmic X-ray background population synthesis
modeling, the model AGN hosts are constrained using optical (B band) and near
infrared (J band, 3.6 um, 5.7 um, 8.0 um, and 24 um) luminosity functions and
number counts. It is found that at z < 1, type 1 and type 2 AGN hosts have
similar stellar populations, in agreement with the orientation based unified
model and indicative of secular evolution. At z > 1, type 2 AGN hosts are
intrinsically different from type 1 AGN hosts, suggesting that the simple
orientation based unified model does not hold at z > 1. Also, it is found that
if Compton thick (CT) AGN evolve like less obscured type 2 AGN, then, on
average, CT AGN hosts are similar to type 2 AGN hosts; however, if CT
obscuration is connected to an evolutionary stage of black hole growth, then CT
AGN hosts will also be in specific evolutionary stages. Multi-wavelength
selection criteria of CT AGN are discussed.

EUV emission locations are consistent with energy deposition from low energy
electrons of ~12 keV occurring in the top layers of the fully ionized

footpoints in the lower neutral chromosphere. The maximum of white-light

analyze the impact of the BMSSM sources of CP violation on the Higgs collider
phenomenology and on low energy flavor and CP violating observables. We
identify distinct Higgs collider signatures that cannot be realized, either in
the case without CP violating phases or in the CP violating MSSM, and
investigate the prospects to probe them at the Tevatron and the LHC. The most
striking benchmark scenario has three neutral Higgs bosons that all decay
dominantly into W boson pairs and that are well within the reach of the 7 TeV
LHC run. On the other hand, we also present scenarios with three Higgs bosons
that have masses M_Hi > 150 GeV and decay dominantly into b bbar. Such
scenarios are much more challenging to probe and can even lie completely
outside the reach of the 7 TeV LHC run. We explore complementary scenarios with
standard MSSM Higgs signals that allow to accommodate a sizable B_s mixing
phase as indicated by D0, as well as the excess in B_s --> mu+ mu- candidates
recently reported by CDF. We find that, in contrast to the MSSM, a minimal
flavor violating soft sector is sufficient to generate significant corrections
to CP violating observables in meson mixing, compatible with EDM constraints.
In particular, a sizable B_s mixing phase, S_psiphi < 0.4, can be achieved for
specific regions of parameter space. Such a large B_s mixing phase would
unambiguously imply a sizable suppression of S_psiKs with respect to the SM

space of No-Scale F-SU(5), starting our analysis with the current operating

F-lipped SU(5) Grand Unified Theory, two pairs of hypothetical TeV scale
vector-like supersymmetric multiplets with origins in F-theory, and the
dynamically established boundary conditions of No-Scale Supergravity. When
searching for a five standard deviation signal, we find that the CMS experiment
at the \sqrt{s} = 7 TeV LHC began to penetrate the phenomenologically viable
parameter space of this model at just under 1/fb of integrated luminosity, and
that the majority of this space remains intact, subsequent to analyses of the
first 1.1/fb of CMS data. On the contrary, the ATLAS experiment had not reached
the F-SU(5) parameter space in its first 1.34/fb of luminosity. Since the CMS
and ATLAS detectors have now each amassed a milestone of 5/fb of collected
luminosity, the current LHC is presently effectively probing No-Scale F-SU(5).
Upon the crossing of the 5/fb threshold, the 7 TeV LHC will have achieved five
standard deviation discoverability for a unified gaugino mass of up to about
532 GeV, a light stop of 577 GeV, a gluino of 728 GeV, and heavy squarks of
just over 1 TeV. Extending the analysis to include a future LHC center-of-mass
beam energy of \sqrt{s} = 14 TeV, the full model space of No-Scale F-SU(5)
should be visible to CMS at about 30/fb of integrated luminosity. We stress
that the F-SU(5) discoverability thresholds discussed here are contingent upon
retaining only those events with nine jets or more for the CMS experiment and
seven jets or more for the ATLAS experiment.

candidate and two heavy right-handed neutrinos being responsible for
leptogenesis to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We study
models based on $A_4$ flavor symmetry in the context of the split seesaw

the split seesaw mechanism. In the model, the experimentally observed neutrino
masses and mixing angles can be realized from both type I+II seesaw
contributions. The model predicts the $\mu-\tau$ symmetry in the neutrino mass
matrix at the leading order, resulting in the vanishing $\theta_{13}$ and
maximal $\theta_{23}$. The flavor symmetry $A_4$ is broken via the flavon
vacuum alignment which can be obtained from the orbifold compactification. The

young planet had cooled to the point that it could support water-based
organisms on its surface. The early emergence of life on Earth has been taken
as evidence that the probability of abiogenesis is high, if starting from
young-Earth-like conditions. We revisit this argument quantitatively in a
Bayesian statistical framework. By constructing a simple model of the
probability of abiogenesis, we calculate a Bayesian estimate of its posterior
probability, given the data that life emerged fairly early in Earth's history
and that, billions of years later, curious creatures noted this fact and
considered its implications. We find that, given only this very limited
empirical information, the choice of Bayesian prior for the abiogenesis
probability parameter has a dominant influence on the computed posterior
probability. Although terrestrial life's early emergence provides evidence that
life might be common in the Universe if early-Earth-like conditions are, the
evidence is inconclusive and indeed is consistent with an arbitrarily low
intrinsic probability of abiogenesis for plausible uninformative priors.
Finding a single case of life arising independently of our lineage (on Earth,
elsewhere in the Solar System, or on an extrasolar planet) would provide much
stronger evidence that abiogenesis is not extremely rare in the Universe.

significantly heat the intergalactic medium (IGM) by pair-producing high-energy
electrons and positrons, which in turn excite vigorous plasma instabilities,
leading to a local dissipation of the pairs' kinetic energy. In this work, we
use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to model the impact of this blazar
heating on the Lyman-alpha forest at redshifts z~2-3. We find that blazar
heating produces an inverted temperature-density relation in the IGM and
naturally resolves many of the problems present in previous simulations of the
forest that included photoheating alone. In particular, our simulations with
blazar heating simultaneously reproduce the observed effective optical depth
and temperature as a function of redshift, the observed probability
distribution functions of the transmitted flux, and the observed flux power
spectra, over the full redshift range 2<z<3 analysed here. Additionally, by
deblending the Lyman-alpha forest into a sum of thermally broadened individual
lines, we find superb agreement with the observed lower cutoff of the
line-width distribution and abundances of neutral hydrogen column densities.
Using the most recent constraints on the cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background,
this excellent agreement with observations does not require rescaling the
amplitude of the UV background; a procedure that was routinely used in the past
to match the observed level of transmitted flux. We also show that our
blazar-heated model matches the data better than standard simulations even when
such a rescaling is allowed. This concordance between Lyman-alpha data and
simulations, which are based on the most recent cosmological parameters,
suggests that the inclusion of blazar heating alleviates previous tensions on
constraints for sigma_8 derived from Lyman-alpha measurements and other
cosmological data. [abridged]

detect only one in the NUV channel, a strongly star-forming S0 that is the
brightest UV source with a measured redshift placing it in SG1120. Stacking the
undetected S0 galaxies (which generally lie on or near the optical red-sequence
of SG1120) still results in no NUV/FUV detection (<2 sigma). Using our limit in
the NUV band, we conclude that for a rapidly truncating star formation rate,
star formation ceased *at least* ~0.1 to 0.7 Gyr ago, depending on the strength
of the starburst prior to truncation. With an exponentially declining
star-formation history over a range of time-scales, we rule out recent
star-formation over a wide range of ages. We conclude that if S0 formation
involves significant star formation, it occurred well before the groups were in
this current pre-assembly phase. As such, it seems that S0 formation is even
more likely to be predominantly occurring outside of the cluster environment.

of their inherently global nature. We argue that in general F-theory
compactifications there are massive Abelian symmetries, such as the uplift of
the Abelian part of the U(N) gauge group on D7-branes, that arise from
non-Kahler resolutions of the dual M-theory setup. The four-dimensional
F-theory vacuum with vanishing expectation values for the gauge fields
corresponds to the Calabi-Yau limit. We propose that fluxes that are turned on
along these U(1)s are uplifted to non-harmonic four-form fluxes. We derive the

effects of possible fluxes on the gauging, tadpoles and matter spectrum.

computed with three different configuration-interaction expansions for each

planet-formation process. An important problem has been that standard migration
theories predict very rapid inward migration, which poses problems for
population synthesis models. However, it has been shown recently that low-mass
planets (20-30 Earth Masses) that are still embedded in the protoplanetary disc
can migrate outwards under certain conditions. Simulations have been performed
mostly for planets at given radii for a particular disc model. Here, we plan to
extend previous work and consider different masses of the disc to quantify the
influence of the physical disc conditions on planetary migration. We perform
three-dimensional (3D) radiation hydrodynamical simulations of embedded planets
in protoplanteary discs. For planets on circular orbits at various locations we
measure the radial dependece of the torques. For all considered planet masses
(20-30 Earth masses) in this study we find outward migration within a limited
radial range of the disc, typically from about 0.5 up to 1.5-2.5 a_Jup. Inside
and outside this intervall, migration is inward and given by the Lindblad value
for large radii. Because outward migration stops at a certain location in the
disc, there exists a zero-torque distance for planetary embryos, where they can
continue to grow without moving too fast. For higher disc masses (M_disc > 0.02
M_Sol) convection ensues, which changes the structure of the disc and therefore
the torque on the planet as well. Outward migration stops at different points
in the disc for different planetary masses, resulting in a quite extended
region where the formation of larger cores might be easier. In higher mass
discs, convection changes the disc's structure resulting in fluctuations in the
surface density, which influence the torque acting on the planet, and therefore
its migration rate.

spectrum of Scheila shows a consistent red slope from 0.8 to 4.0$\mu$m with no
apparent absorption features, resembling spectra of D-type asteroids. An
intimate mixing model suggests that the amount of water ice that might be
present on the surface of Scheila is no more than a few percent. The spectrum
of the Tagish Lake chondrite matches the asteroid's spectrum at shorter
wavelengths ($\lambda < 2.5 \mu$m), but no hydration features are observed at
longer wavelengths on Scheila. Our analysis corroborates other studies
suggesting that the comet-like activity of Scheila is likely not caused by the
sublimation of water ice. The dust coma and tail may be results of a recent

available multiwavelength data from GOODS-South, MUSYC, and COMBO-17 to
characterize the spectral energy distributions for these galaxies and determine
stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuations. We compare
these properties for LBGs selected in this paper versus z~3 LBGs and other
CDF-S galaxies in the same redshift range (0.5<z<2), identified using
photometric redshift techniques. The z~1 LBGs have slightly lower stellar
masses compared to z~3 LBGs and slightly higher stellar masses compared to the
z~1 CDF-S galaxies. Similarly, our sample of z~1 LBGs has SFRs (derived using
both ultraviolet and infrared data, where available) nearly an order of
magnitude lower than z~3 LBGs but slightly higher than the comparison z~1
sample of CDF-S galaxies. We find that our z~1 UV-dropouts have A_FUV higher
than z~3 LBGs, but is similar to the distribution of dust attenuations in the
other CDF-S galaxies. Using the GOODS-South multiwavelength catalog of
galaxies, we simulate a larger and fainter sample of LBGs to compare their

proposed architecture is based on a family of network-MIMO schemes defined by
small clusters of cooperating base stations, zero-forcing multiuser MIMO
precoding with suitable inter-cluster interference constraints, uplink pilot
signals reuse across cells, and frequency reuse. The key idea consists of
partitioning the users population into geographically determined ""bins"", such
that all users in the same bin are statistically equivalent, and use the
optimal network-MIMO architecture in the family for each bin. A scheduler takes
care of serving the different bins on the time-frequency slots, in order to
maximize a desired network utility function that captures some desired notion
of fairness. This results in a mixed-mode network-MIMO architecture, where
different schemes, each of which is optimized for the served user bin, are
multiplexed in time-frequency. In order to carry out the performance analysis
and the optimization of the proposed architecture in a clean and
computationally efficient way, we consider the large-system regime where the
number of users, the number of antennas, and the channel coherence block length
go to infinity with fixed ratios. The performance predicted by the large-system
asymptotic analysis matches very well the finite-dimensional simulations.
Overall, the system spectral efficiency obtained by the proposed architecture
is similar to that achieved by ""Massive MIMO"", with a 10-fold reduction in the
number of antennas at the base stations (roughly, from 500 to 50 antennas).

(DoS) attacks. Selective DoS attacks lower anonymity as they force paths to be
rebuilt multiple times to ensure delivery which increases the opportunity for
more attack. In this paper we present a detection algorithm that filters out
compromised communication channels for one of the most widely used anonymity
networks, Tor. Our detection algorithm uses two levels of probing to filter out
potentially compromised tunnels. We perform probabilistic analysis and
extensive simulation to show the robustness of our detection algorithm. We also
analyze the overhead of our detection algorithm and show that we can achieve
satisfactory security guarantee for reasonable communication overhead (5% of
the total available Tor bandwidth in the worst case). Real world experiments
reveal that our detection algorithm provides good defense against selective DoS
attack.

collapse is that three-body interactions of single stars form many soft
binaries, most of which are quickly destroyed, but eventually one of them
survives. We report on direct N-body simulations to test these ideas, for the
first time. We find that both assumptions are often incorrect: 1) quite a few
three-body interactions produce a hard binary from scratch; 2) and in many
cases there are more than three bodies directly and simultaneously involved in
the production of the first binary. The main reason for the discrepancies is
that the core of a star cluster, at the first deep collapse, contains typically
only five or so stars. Therefore, the homogeneous background assumption, which
still would be reasonable for, say, 25 stars, utterly breaks down. There have
been some speculations in this direction, but we demonstrate this result here
explicitly, for the first time.

easily computed by the hook-length formula. In 1981, Amitai Regev proved that
the number of SYTs having at most three rows with n entries equals the nth
Motzkin number M_n. In 2006, Regev conjectured that the total number of SYTs of
skew shape {\lambda}/(2, 1) over all partitions {\lambda} having at most three
parts with n entries is the difference of two Motzkin numbers, M_{n-1} -
M_{n-3}. Ekhad and Zeilberger proved Regev's conjecture using a computer
program. In 2009, S.-P. Eu found a bijection between Motzkin paths and SYTs of
skew shape with at most three rows to prove Regev's conjecture, and Eu also
indirectly showed that for the fixed {\mu} = ({\mu}1,{\mu}2) the number of SYTs
of skew shape {\lambda}/{\mu} over all partitions {\lambda} having at most
three parts can be expressed as a linear combination of the Motzkin numbers. In
this paper, we will find an explicit formula for the generating function for
the general case: for each partition {\mu} having at most three parts the
generating function gives a formula for the coefficients of the linear
combination of Motzkin numbers. We will also show that these generating
functions are unexpectedly related to the Chebyshev polynomials of the second
kind.

considerable attention recently. The number of Pareto-optimal solutions (i.e.,
solutions with the property that no other solution is at least as good in all
the coordinates and better in at least one) for multiobjective optimization
problems is the central object of study. In this paper, we prove several lower
bounds for the expected number of Pareto optima. Our basic result is a lower
bound of \Omega_d(n^(d-1)) for optimization problems with d objectives and n
variables under fairly general conditions on the distributions of the linear
objectives. Our proof relates the problem of lower bounding the number of
Pareto optima to results in geometry connected to arrangements of hyperplanes.
We use our basic result to derive (1) To our knowledge, the first lower bound
for natural multiobjective optimization problems. We illustrate this for the
maximum spanning tree problem with randomly chosen edge weights. Our technique
is sufficiently flexible to yield such lower bounds for other standard
objective functions studied in this setting (such as, multiobjective shortest
path, TSP tour, matching). (2) Smoothed lower bound of min {\Omega_d(n^(d-1.5)
\phi^{(d-log d) (1-\Theta(1/\phi))}), 2^{\Theta(n)}}$ for the 0-1 knapsack
problem with d profits for phi-semirandom distributions for a version of the

the SiO line, and the distance between the brightest peak and deflection point
suggests that the enhancement of SiO takes about 100 yr after the collision

interferometric maps of SiO, ammonia, formaldehyde, and HCN lines. Their

number of estimators have been proposed. Although most of the estimators claim
to be the maximum likelihood estimators, the claim is only partially true since
the maximum likelihood estimate can be obtained at most for a class of data
sets. Unfortunately, few people are aware of this restriction that leads to a
misconception that an estimator is applicable to all data sets as far as it
returns a unique solution. To correct this, we in this paper point out the risk
of this misconception and illustrate the inconsistency between data and model
in the most influential estimators. To ensure the model used in estimation
consistent with the data collected from an experiment, the data sets used in
estimation are divided into 4 classes according to the characteristics of
observations. Based on the classification, the validity of an estimator is
defined and the validity of the most influential estimators is evaluated. In
addition, a number of estimators are proposed, one for a class of data sets
that have been overlooked. Further, a general estimator is proposed that is
applicable to all data classes. The discussion starts from the tree topology

efficiency in the models and simulations, a set of models are also calculated

complexity can be reduced by separating qubit manipulation from measurement and

Tunnelling between neighbouring dots has been demonstrated[3, 4] with great
control, and the manipulation of electrons in single and double-dot systems is
advancing rapidly.[5-8] For distances greater than a few hundred nanometres
neither free propagation nor tunnelling are viable whilst maintaining
confinement of single electrons. Here we show how a single electron may be
captured in a surface acoustic wave minimum and transferred from one quantum
dot to a second unoccupied dot along a long empty channel. The transfer
direction may be reversed and the same electron moved back and forth over sixty
times without error, a cumulative distance of 0.25 mm. Such on-chip transfer
extends communication between quantum dots to a range that may allow the

formed by introduction of stacking fault arrays into a Ag thin film. The
surface states of such striped Ag thin films are studied using a low
temperature scanning tunneling microscope. Standing waves running in the
longitudinal direction and characteristic spectral peaks are observed by
differential conductance (dI/dV) measurements, revealing the presence of 1D
states on the surface stripes. Their formation can be attributed to quantum
confinement of Ag(111) surface states into a stripe by stacking faults. To
quantify the degree of confinement, the effective potential barrier at the
stacking fault for Ag(111) surface states is estimated from independent
measurements. A single quantum well model with the effective potential barrier
can reproduce the main features of dI/dV spectra on stripes, while a
Kronig-Penney model fails to do so. Thus the present system should be viewed as
decoupled 1D states on individual stripes rather than as anisotropic 2D Bloch
states extending over a stripe array.

expansion of the two-locus sampling distribution when the recombination rate
$\rho$ is moderate to large. In this paper, a new computational technique is
developed for finding the asymptotic expansion to an arbitrary order.

proved here that only a finite number of terms in the asymptotic expansion is
needed to recover (via the method of Pad\'{e} approximants) the exact two-locus

for all values of $\rho\in[0,\infty)$. It is also shown that the new

scales given by the age of the subject or the spatial resolution of the
neuroimaging method. Integration of data across scales can only be successful
if the combined networks show a similar architecture. One way to compare
networks is to look at spatial features, based on fibre length, and topological
features of individual nodes where outlier nodes form single node motifs whose
frequency yields a fingerprint of the network. Here, we observe how
characteristic single node motifs change over age (12-23 years) and network
size (414, 813, and 1615 nodes) for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) structural
connectivity in healthy human subjects. First, we find the number and diversity
of motifs in a network to be strongly correlated. Second, comparing different
scales, the number and diversity of motifs varied across the temporal (subject
age) and spatial (network resolution) scale: certain motifs might only occur at
one spatial scale or for a certain age range. Third, regions of interest which
show one motif at a lower resolution may show a range of motifs at a higher
resolution which may or may not include the original motif at the lower
resolution. Therefore, both the type and localisation of motifs differ for
different spatial resolutions. Our results also indicate that spatial
resolution has a higher effect on topological measures whereas spatial
measures, based on fibre lengths, remain more comparable between resolutions.
Therefore, spatial resolution is crucial when comparing characteristic node
fingerprints given by topological and spatial network features. As node motifs
are based on topological and spatial properties of brain connectivity networks,
these conclusions are also relevant to other studies using connectome analysis.

excellent probe of high density gas allowing us to measure key parameters such
as gas temperatures, opacities, and column densities, as well as providing an
insight into the gas kinematics. The average kinetic temperature, FWHM line
width and total NH3 column density for the sample are approximately 22 K, 2
km/s and 2x10^{15} cm^{-2}, respectively. We find that the NH3 (1,1) line width
and kinetic temperature are correlated with luminosity and finding no
underlying dependence of these parameters on the evolutionary phase of the
embedded sources, we conclude that the observed trends in the derived
parameters are more likely to be due to the energy output of the central source
and/or the line width-clump mass relationship. The velocities of the peak H2O
masers and the NH3 emission are in excellent agreement with each other, which
would strongly suggest an association between the dense gas and the maser
emission. Moreover, we find the bolometric luminosity of the embedded source
and the isotropic luminosity of the H2O maser are also correlated. We conclude
from the correlations of the cloud and water maser velocities and the
bolometric and maser luminosity that there is a strong dynamical relationship

galaxy-shape distortions with spin-1 and spin-3 symmetry. We show in this paper
that and how such distortions are generally caused not only by the flexion
itself, but also by coupling terms of the form (shear $\times$ flexion), which
have hitherto been neglected. Similar coupling terms occur between intrinsic
galaxy ellipticities and the flexion. We show, by means of numerical tests,
that neglecting these terms can introduce biases of up to 85% on the $F$
flexion and 150% on the $G$ flexion for galaxies with an intrinsic ellipticity
dispersion of $\sigma_{\epsilon}=0.3$. In general, this bias depends on the
strength of the lensing fields, the ellipticity dispersion, and the
concentration of the lensed galaxies. We derive a new set of equations relating
the measured spin-1 and spin-3 distortions to the lensing fields up to first
order in the shear, the flexion, the product of shear and flexion, and the
morphological properties of the galaxy sample. We show that this new
description is accurate with a bias $\leq 7%$ (spin-1 distortion) and $\leq 3%$

forces acting between them were gradually increased during MD. After 500-800 ps
the transformation of the mono-adduct (straight DNA with the cisplatin residue
linked to one guanine-N7) to the bus-adduct (bent DNA where Pt atom is
connected through the N7 atoms of neighboring guanines) was observed. A cavity
between palatinate guanines is formed and filled with solvent molecules. The
rapid inclination of the center base pairs initiates a slow transition of the
whole molecule from the linear to the bent conformation. After about 1000-1300
ps a stable structure was reached, which is very similar to the one described

powerful experimental tool in systems of ultracold atoms. It has been used to
explore a variety of intriguing phenomena in recent experiments. However not
all of the many-body properties of such systems can be understood in terms of
effective models with contact interaction given by the scattering length of the
two particles in vacuum. For example, when a two component Fermi mixture is
quenched to the BEC side of the Feshbach resonance, a positive scattering
length suggests that interactions are repulsive and thus collective dynamics
should be dominated by the Stoner instability toward a spin polarized
ferromagnetic state. On the other hand, existence of low energy two particle
bound states suggests a competing instability driven by molecule formation.
Compe- tition between spontaneous magnetization and pair formation is
determined by the the interplay of two-particle and many-body phenomena. In
these lecture notes we summarize our recent theoretical results, which analyzed
this competition from the point of view of unstable collective modes. We also

exhibits a quantum phase transition (QPT). Quantities related to quantum
information theoretic measures like entanglement, quantum discord (QD) and
fidelity are known to provide signatures of QPTs. The issue is less well
explored when the quantum system is subjected to decoherence due to its
interaction, represented by a quantum channel, with an environment. In this
paper we study the dynamics of the mutual information $I(\rho_{AB})$, the
classical correlations $C(\rho_{AB})$ and the quantum correlations
$Q(\rho_{AB})$, as measured by the QD, in a two-qubit state the density matrix
of which is the reduced density matrix obtained from the ground state of the
TIM in 1d. The time evolution brought about by system-environment interactions
is assumed to be Markovian in nature and the quantum channels considered are
amplitude damping, bit-flip, phase-flip and bit-phase-flip. Each quantum
channel is shown to be distinguished by a specific type of dynamics. In the
case of the phase-flip channel, there is a finite time interval in which the
quantum correlations are larger in magnitude than the classical correlations.
For this channel as well as the bit-phase-flip channel, appropriate quantities
associated with the dynamics of the correlations can be derived which signal
the occurrence of a QPT.

strong-field approximation and the steepest descent framework for the
recollision-excitation with subsequent tunneling ionization (RESI) pathway in
laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI). In this time-delayed
pathway, an electron returns to its parent ion, and, by recolliding with the
core, gives part of its kinetic energy to excite a second electron at a time
$t^{\prime}$. The second electron then reaches the continuum at a later time
$t$ by tunneling ionization. We show that, if $t^{\prime}$ and $t$ are complex,
the condition that recollision of the first electron occurs before tunnel
ionization of the second electron translates into boundary conditions for the
steepest-descent contours, and thus puts constraints on the saddles to be taken
when computing the RESI transition amplitudes. We also show that this
generalized causality condition has a dramatic effect in the shapes of the RESI
electron momentum distributions for few-cycle laser pulses. Physically,
causality determines how the dominant sets of orbits an electron returning to
its parent ion can be combined with the dominant orbits of a second electron
tunneling from an excited state. All features encountered are analyzed in terms
of such orbits, and their quantum interference.

of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating observed uncertainties
in a consistent manner. We find well localized solutions in the posterior
probability distribution functions for two of the three parameters of interest,
namely the Alfven travel time and the transverse inhomogeneity length-scale.
The obtained estimates for the Alfven travel time are consistent with previous
inversion results, but the method enables us to additionally constrain the
transverse inhomogeneity length-scale and to estimate real error bars for each
parameter. When observational estimates for the density contrast are used, the
method enables us to fully constrain the three parameters of interest. These
results can serve to improve our current estimates of unknown physical

freedom provided by the stochastic dimension in defining cost functionals is
explored, demonstrating the scope for controlling statistical aspects of the
system response. One-shot stochastic finite element methods are used to find
approximate solutions to control problems. It is shown that applying the
stochastic collocation finite element to the formulated problem leads to a
coupling between stochastic collocation points when a deterministic optimal
control is considered or when moments are included in the cost functional,
thereby obviating the primary advantage of the collocation method over the
stochastic Galerkin method for the considered problem. The application of the
presented methods is demonstrated through a number of numerical examples. The
presented framework is sufficiently general to also consider a class of inverse

Caginalp phase field model for phase transitions when including a diffusive

have been extensively studied by Miranville and Quintanilla. We prove existence
and uniqueness of a weak solution to the initial-boundary value problem, as

error estimates for the difference of the solutions.

Because with Relatively large gap, the 2D bulk subbands may lie in the regimes

instead of always WAL. As a result, the bulk states may contribute small
magnetoconductivity or even compensate the WAL from the surface states.

distinguishable due to the finiteness of local frequency. Thus, both approach

the fermionic preon and 6 preonic scalars, its MUSY partners. As an example, we
present well known \beta-decay process at MUSY level. MUSY also forbids some
processes such as proton decay (preserving the baryon number) and hence, it is
compatible with current experimental results. In this model the number of SM
generations arises to be three naturally.
  The MUSY generalization of the SUSY algebra is constructed and the MUSY
invariant Lagrangian is also explicitly written. Similar to other preonic and
supersymmetric models, a number of new particles are predicted. These particles
do not interact with any of the SM fermions but only with the gauge bosons.
These particles could be dark matter candidates.

From the best fit values, we run four sets of simulation with different initial

matter isocurvature is small, we can not detect its signal through matter power
spectrum and two point correlation function with large scale survey. However,
the halo mass function can give an obvious signal. Compared to 5% difference on
matter power spectrum, it can get 37% at $z = 3$ on halo mass function. This

the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) area. Selected as X-ray extended sources,
they have total masses (M_200) of 1.9(+/-0.41)E13 and 9.5(+/-0.42)E13 M_sun,
respectively, as obtained from a recent X-ray luminosity-mass scaling relation.
The lower mass system appears isolated, whereas the other sits in a well-known
large-scale structure (LSS) populated by 27 other X-ray emitting groups. The
identification as fossil is based on the i-band photometry of all the galaxies
with a photo-z consistent with that of the group at the 2-sigma confidence
level and within a projected group-centric distance equal to 0.5R_200, and
i_AB<=22.5-mag limited spectroscopy. Both fossil groups exhibit high
stellar-to-total mass ratios compared to all the X-ray selected groups of
similar mass at 0.3<=z<=0.5 in the COSMOS. At variance with the composite
galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) of similarly massive systems, both fossil
group GSMFs are dominated by passively evolving galaxies down to M^stars~1E10
M_sun (according to the galaxy broad-band spectral energy distributions). The
relative lack of star-forming galaxies with 1E10<=M^stars<=1E11 M_sun is
confirmed by the galaxy distribution in the b-r vs i color-magnitude diagram.
Hence, the 2 fossil groups appear as more mature than the coeval, similarly
massive groups. Their overall star formation activity ended rapidly after an
accelerated build up of the total stellar mass; no significant infall of
galaxies with M^stars>=1E10 M_sun took place in the last 3 to 6 Gyr. This
similarity holds although the 2 fossil groups are embedded in two very
different density environments of the LSS, which suggests that their galaxy
populations were shaped by processes that do not depend on the LSS. However,
their progenitors may do so. ...

the tension between the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies and disappearance data

extension of the Standard Model with such fermion singlets is the addition of
right-handed sterile neutrinos with small Majorana masses. Even when
introducing three right-handed neutrinos, this scenario has less free
parameters than the 3+2 scenarios studied in the literature. This begs the
question whether the best fit regions obtained can be reproduced by this
simplest extension of the Standard Model. In order to address this question, we
devise an exact parametrization of Standard Model extensions with right-handed
neutrinos. Apart from the usual 3x3 neutrino mixing matrix and the 3 masses of
the lightest neutrinos, the extra degrees of freedom are encoded in another 3x3
unitary matrix and 3 additional mixing angles. The parametrization includes all
the correlations among masses and mixings and is valid beyond the usual seesaw
approximation. Through this parametrization we find that the best fit regions
for the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies in a 3+2 scenario can indeed be reproduced
despite the smaller number of degrees of freedom.

concurrently with PUs subject to interference constraints, while the ICRs

when both PUs and UCTs are absent. We investigate the design of MIMO precoding
algorithms for the UCT that increase the detection probability at the ICRs,
while simultaneously meeting a desired Quality-of-Service target to the
underlay cognitive receivers (UCRs) and constraining interference leaked to
PUs. The objective of such a proactive approach, referred to as prescient

shorter than the observed flare decay times, which in turn are much shorter

Spectroscopy) is the first light instrument of the Gran Telescopio Canarias
(GTC). It provides a flexible and competitive tunable filter (TF). Since it is
based on a Fabry-Perot interferometer working in collimated beam, the TF
transmission wavelength depends on the position of the target with respect to
the optical axis. This effect is non-negligible and must be accounted for in
the data reduction. Our paper establishes a wavelength calibration for OSIRIS
TF with the accuracy required for spectrophotometric measurements using the
full field of view (FOV) of the instrument. The variation of the transmission
wavelength $\lambda(R)$ across the FOV is well described by
$\lambda(R)=\lambda(0)/\sqrt{1+(R/f_2)^2}$, where $\lambda(0)$ is the central
wavelength, $R$ represents the physical distance from the optical axis, and
$f_2=185.70\pm0.17\,$mm is the effective focal length of the camera lens. This
new empirical calibration yields an accuracy better than 1\,\AA\ across the
entire OSIRIS FOV ($\sim$8\arcmin$\times$8\arcmin), provided that the position
of the optical axis is known within 45 $\mu$m ($\equiv$ 1.5 binned pixels). We
suggest a calibration protocol to grant such precision over long periods, upon
re-alignment of OSIRIS optics, and in different wavelength ranges. This
calibration differs from the calibration in OSIRIS manual which, nonetheless,
provides an accuracy $\lesssim1$\AA\, for $R\lesssim 2\arcmin$.

mass-splitting between rho- and a1-mesons such that they are now readily seen
to be parity partners in the meson spectrum; features of electromagnetic form
factors connected with charged and neutral pions; and computation and
explanation of valence-quark distribution functions in pseudoscalar mesons. We
argue that in solving QCD, a constructive feedback between theory and extant

that QCD plasma behaves as a nearly perfect fluid described by relativistic
hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamics is an effective low-energy Theory Of Everything
stating that the response of a system to external perturbations is dictated by
conservation laws that are a consequence of the symmetries of the underlying
theory. In the case of QCD fluid produced in heavy ion collisions, this theory
possesses anomalies, so some of the apparent classical symmetries are broken by
quantum effects. Even though the anomalies appear as a result of UV
regularization and so look like a short distance phenomenon, it has been
realized recently that they also affect the large distance, macroscopic
behavior in hydrodynamics. One of the manifestations of anomalies in
relativistic hydrodynamics is the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). At this
conference, a number of evidences for CME have been presented, including i) the
disappearance of charge asymmetry fluctuations in the low-energy RHIC data
where the energy density is thought to be below the critical one for
deconfinement; ii) the observation of charge asymmetry fluctuations in Pb-Pb

used to estimate spin period, period derivative, astrometric, and binary

gravitational waves has on pulsar timing parameters through the use of
simulations and data from the millisecond pulsars PSR J0437--4715 and PSR

underestimated with increasing background amplitude by up to a factor of
$\sim10$ for a stochastic gravitational-wave background amplitude of $A=5\times

one-year gravitational wave periods. We find evidence for prominent
low-frequency spectral leakage in simulated data sets including a stochastic

Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of parallax to set a
2--sigma upper limit of $A\le9.1\times 10^{-14}$. We find that different
supermassive black hole assembly scenarios do not have a significant effect on

resonance energies for one-dimensional potentials. We calculate the shape
resonances for symmetric two-barrier potentials and compare them with those
coming from the Siegert approximation, the complex scaling method and the
box-stabilization method. A comparison of the Breit-Wigner profile and the
transmission coefficient about its maximum illustrates that the agreement is
better the sharper the resonance.

  Wide Web. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1004.5339","Journal of Web Semantics 12 (2012) 88-103","10.1016/j.websem.2011.12.006",,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effective debugging of ontologies is an important prerequisite for their
broad application, especially in areas that rely on everyday users to create
and maintain knowledge bases, such as the Semantic Web. In such systems
ontologies capture formalized vocabularies of terms shared by its users.
However in many cases users have different local views of the domain, i.e. of
the context in which a given term is used. Inappropriate usage of terms
together with natural complications when formulating and understanding logical
descriptions may result in faulty ontologies. Recent ontology debugging
approaches use diagnosis methods to identify causes of the faults. In most
debugging scenarios these methods return many alternative diagnoses, thus
placing the burden of fault localization on the user. This paper demonstrates
how the target diagnosis can be identified by performing a sequence of
observations, that is, by querying an oracle about entailments of the target
ontology. To identify the best query we propose two query selection strategies:
a simple ""split-in-half"" strategy and an entropy-based strategy. The latter
allows knowledge about typical user errors to be exploited to minimize the
number of queries. Our evaluation showed that the entropy-based method
significantly reduces the number of required queries compared to the
""split-in-half"" approach. We experimented with different probability
distributions of user errors and different qualities of the a-priori
probabilities. Our measurements demonstrated the superiority of entropy-based
query selection even in cases where all fault probabilities are equal, i.e.
where no information about typical user errors is available.

challenge that needs to be overcome in order to consolidate the benefits
associated with such structures. We study the impact of the nature of the
information exchanged over the possibilities of success of this process, basing
ourselves on the analysis of the information produced by the members of the
Network of National Educational Portals. One of the main challenges that the
Network of National Educational Portals faces consists in finding effective
ways of sharing information that can promote knowledge transfer between members
of the network. We argue that a key factor that prevents information sharing is
the use of performance metrics by portal responsibles to evaluate the results
of their decisions. These metrics are highly sensitive, context-dependent, and
produced through non-standardized methods, all of which reduce the willingness
of knowledge sharing. We present a different approach: based on the Network of
National Educational Portals case, we propose creating a comprehensive
information system aimed at providing reliable and timely information in a
systematic fashion. We believe that adopting standardized procedures and
indicators of less sensitive nature, we can produce information for all
partners without the shortcomings of the usual practices.
